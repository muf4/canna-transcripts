[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
You're ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear you.
We're good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we wanted to start out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, or two weeks ago, we ended with
part one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went over the introduction of Smell
Boat Seeds, kind of how it all started,
[SPEAKER_02]: how Smell Boat came to be, what it meant,
what it even meant, and some of the naming
[SPEAKER_02]: conventions of some of your lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went over Rainbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We even touched a little bit on your
brother at the end, which I'm sure people
[SPEAKER_02]: were surprised that we even cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we talked a little bit about what we
didn't cover, what we missed, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other things we wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do a part two.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the episodes I think I've
been hit up about most for people wanting
[SPEAKER_02]: us to do a part two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, you've got to do them next
week, and we already had something
[SPEAKER_02]: planned, so we're diving back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of people reach out,
unexpectedly, sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of friends, people who I talk
to on Instagram and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was strangers that were reaching out
to me, and they were all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I listened to your podcast a long
time ago, and then this one, and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you go more in detail on this,
more in detail on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are the fucking seeds being released
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I am a stingy bastard when it
comes to releasing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking horrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, my precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year, two years, five, and close enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I work with them for four years
before I let anyone touch them?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's so much better than flooding the
market with just crap that you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: proud of or that you're not sure of,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys didn't get to see our intro,
but we literally were talking for another
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to fucking stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to stop because we have to have
shit for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it could have been another episode
in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it just kept flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want me to talk about what's coming
up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the seeds that you're
going to be releasing in the next week or
[SPEAKER_02]: so, because I have to go meet up with them
to go pick these up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have them in hand, but we are
going to release these in the next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plan was for today, I had a rock
monster come out of my penis, and it hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest rock monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidney stone about hurt me to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had an ugly night last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Matt and I talked this morning,
he was all, hey, things are going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was all, honestly, I'm glad you're
saying it because I beat the fuck today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just do this and then we'll meet
up this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of want to do this release a
little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't going to be like,
here's 15 varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that I really, really,
really have loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I shouldn't say that the ones
that they're all fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the five, these are the five that are
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start off with the
London pound cake 75 by the rainbow
[SPEAKER_00]: sister.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool thing about it is, is that the
London pound cake is turp show up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not it's weird structure.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not it's weird structure of,
like, if you don't nail that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: like she will get poofy on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not larvae per se, but poofy on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like an old hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, not as, um, not as dense as like a
cookies or OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you add that rainbow to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that turp, but you get the rainbow
high profile growth pattern structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fucking been repetitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have found a few that are gassy,
like a gassy fruit is the only way I can
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a aerosol-y fruit that gets in your,
uh, sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of them are like the,
uh, a lemon OG or a berry OG or something
[SPEAKER_00]: around that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just say get in your sensors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get up motherfucker right there in the
sensors, like you're a robot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get right up in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get up in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's the fucking first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you named it yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or has your daughter named it yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: She hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to just do a spinning
board of names of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, well, yeah, that's something that
we should discuss because I am the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: at naming plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My names have always been this plant by
this plant is what this plant is called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're getting back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted everything to be like
fucking cream puff pie with cinnamon
[SPEAKER_00]: strudel and Twinkie dicks and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it tastes like Twinkie dicks
and it never tastes like Twinkie dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never tastes like a Twinkie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one is really fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I am not, uh, uh, a huge fan of,
uh, some of these, these, these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that are popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did some runs crosses and stuff as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, least it to a few friends
because they were very much wanting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for me, it was, I don't trust the,
the, the rents plant as much as I did the
[SPEAKER_00]: London pound cake 75, uh, the London pound
cake 75 has shown it's, it's a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: sunset sherbert, but I really enjoyed the
cut of sunset sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got years ago, the first one that I
worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has that funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyhow, that was number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is a plant that is a blue
Hawaiian by Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that a Jordan of the islands one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's a Jordan of the
islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody gifted me this club and they were
all, Hey, you have to try this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was all cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sat for a long time and then I grew
it and it's fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it like on its own?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you remember, uh, oh, God,
what was the name of that fucking plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jesus, it's an old Europe,
Europe guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it turned like this weird purple on
the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think black roses made from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have blackberry or black.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I think it was even like,
uh, around those times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, uh, I think I'll go grab the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandy, Sandy seeds made this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually turns like this,
this weird lilac purple right off the bat,
[SPEAKER_00]: like right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it will come to me, uh,
in a minute on what the name of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I still have some of Sandy's
original release of the seeds and the
[SPEAKER_00]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so anyways, killing fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing fields is a old Jack Harrow
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will remind you of killing fields,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the color and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it has this like berry flavory
smell, taste thing going on to it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming blue Hawaiian is a blueberry
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually crossed the blue bonnet to a
blue Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably got a lot of fucking
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually saved you a pack of the London
pound cake crossed the blue bonnet too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that will be fucking interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just had a small clone,
you know, of it growing, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved you some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I brought you, did I bring you
that clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought you that fucking clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saved it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ended the Romulan part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Romulan part was weird because I
kept seeing more of the blue Hawaiian show
[SPEAKER_00]: and color and stature and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the rainbow, you were
getting more of a rainbow look and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainbow thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost like the rainbow overpowered
the blue Hawaiian Romulan, except for
[SPEAKER_00]: coloring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get these rainbow plants with
that killing fields looking purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that weird purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You crack it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, the lilac color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lilac purple look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you want something that will like
remind you of like a different time,
[SPEAKER_00]: a different era.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking one because it's
just a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, when people ask me like,
what is rainbow tastes like it's dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I get the most is it
reminds me of the first time I smoked good
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it reminds me of that time,
like when, you know, green bud or kind
[SPEAKER_00]: buds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it reminds me of that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one can really like give me like an
explanation other than it reminds me of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get like that menthol minty,
like doughy, you know, that soury dough
[SPEAKER_00]: type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that rainbow sister, like I said,
that was Brynn's favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of my favorites too,
but it was, it was more chocolatey version
[SPEAKER_02]: of that, which is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like a cocoa stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the shit that you see that
promises chocolate doesn't provide
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, a lot of the stuff that people promise
chocolate with turns out like earthy and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not milk chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just earthy and you can vaguely hope
for some chocolate over there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That used to have a bubba cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what it was crossed
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, gifted plants, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember at one time, late nineties,
early two thousands, when you started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in with these tight friends and
stuff like that, and people would gift you
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bubba cross that I had that
was like espresso, like straight up,
[SPEAKER_00]: like drinking a cup of fucking espresso.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I wish I still had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't yield for fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the world's smallest plant,
but the flower, like that coffee,
[SPEAKER_00]: like literally you open the bag and the
house smelled like fucking a bag of coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a clock, this one called Smart Alex
that was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a, you open it and it just
smelled like opening a can of folders,
[SPEAKER_02]: like sticking your nose in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like, how does this even exist?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this terpene exist in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one was Rainbow Sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that one already,
the S1 version, the San Diego OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I have went over in detail with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still going to get Matt a cut and some
flowers of it so he can kind of see where
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's either related to or from the
same time and just one of the cuts went
[SPEAKER_00]: one way and one of the cuts with Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're all around that same area,
the same timeframe, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally growing a Triangle plant and
the San Diego plant beside each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke the San Diego every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a different profile,
like a smell profile, but that could still
[SPEAKER_00]: be from like a Drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still get Drift in your smells and
your growth patterns and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if one plant was beat up for
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be that Drift or they could
be seeds from the same parents where they
[SPEAKER_00]: both came from or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely fucking related,
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their structure, everything looks the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit that San Diego has
more of this putrid-ness, like this
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking nasty dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant, that one will fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that one gives you that old school,
like locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to move a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sit here and fish or play
video games or just going to sit here and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking drool on myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I exist and natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was four now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think it was four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great pie for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: By itself, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super fucking easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes everyone look like a rock star
when you grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The funny thing about that cut was it was
from Canorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Harry Palms who selected
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a one out of one seed
selection, just one pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just turned out phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were saying something about
three or four seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember we talked with Canorado at one
of the shows and he was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like before it hit the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was showing me pictures on this phone
and I was going over some of the pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: of the rainbow and we were both just
comparing some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the nicer dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canorado is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always, always so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people have a lot of
impressions of him because he released,
[SPEAKER_02]: like me, he released a lot of femme lines,
femmes across the femmes to stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just assume that's all he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have loads of regular seeds and old
lines that he's reproduced and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he does some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not a lot of people are privy to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people too see when
you do femme lines and you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, if people seen what our DMs
look like, they would understand why we
[SPEAKER_00]: release so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really released femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be one of my first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made them to hold down genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my DMs are, when will you release
femmes?
[SPEAKER_00]: When will you make femmes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then are you going to do a femme seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Femme seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many people who don't keep
moms, who don't make clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't keep moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to waste space on males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space, space, space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one fucking thing we get all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of us have 120 fucking lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I have fucking mom rooms that
are the size of most of the people's
[SPEAKER_00]: flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's for me, I kind of forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember those days in the early 90s or
mid, I shouldn't say early, mid to late
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this tiny little fucking closet
in a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a light I stole off of the fucking
street light, because it had a ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well into the 2000s, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still using old magnetic ballasts and
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I had the tweakers steal the fucking
actual streetlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how my dad used to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The metal halides off the streetlights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would flower under those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got my first magnetic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember they were just pieces of
shit, but they didn't ever stop running.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some of them that are like 30
fucking years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could still plug them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is though, they never stop
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if they get sprayed with water,
they never stop running.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your room floods, they never stop
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're going to electric shit out of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the five that we were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was considering doing the wedding cake
rainbow cyst, or the GMO rainbow cyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GMO rainbow cyst, I don't know if
people will grow it to its ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take her 75, 80 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people aren't wanting to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I release it and people are like,
hey, look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This girl is like poo butt, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's crazy is she looked done at 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she'll look done at 63, but then
she'll hit a second growth at 67.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by 78, she is just the nastiest
garlic B-O thingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will eventually get released,
but it will be a short release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be like, hey, understand what
you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what you're getting with this
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting a 63 day here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to add two more weeks to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to pull it there anyway,
so it don't matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will, and then they'll wash it and
it'll wash beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dip it in the hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, get all my fucking bugs off of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of bugs, let's segue into our
next little topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those seeds are going to be available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rightseeds.com next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make a post on Patreon and Instagram
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people will know when they're
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, before we go, everything is packed
for our seed winners last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is literally packed sitting
over in the little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go get everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you guys watch the show tonight,
your motherfucking seeds are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: flying away to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have four or five packages
heading out to good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they just slide into the fucking DMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they want shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need them dicks right there,
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need them Twinkie dick dicks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about your feet cramping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally have my feet stuck in a
foot massager right now, like a dual foot
[SPEAKER_00]: foot massage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so fucking dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back of my eyes and my feet are just
like, keep cramping up and I'm all,
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see me itching around
tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of people who don't know,
I've had my colon removed years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a number on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't have been in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to remove some.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get dehydrated really fucking easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been a little ill lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little puffy, a little
dehydrated, so I'm super fucking crampy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, like I'm having my man,
my man-stration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, man-stration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cramped up from my man-stration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I man-strated down to my penis from the
kidney stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also has kidney stones.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has some good kidney stone stories too
about airplanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, did we tell that story ever before?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, but we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should tell you two things to not do
with kidney stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, sit down to pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a sit-spin flair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what they call it,
sit-spin flair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all like, oh my God, I'm going to
pass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to sit down to pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you sit down to pee, it kind of
kinks your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kidney stone gets in there and
it's all like, and it's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it feels like the tip of your dick gets
blown off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they pressurized the plane
and that kidney stone drops out into your
[SPEAKER_00]: ureter and all of a sudden that fucking
plane pressurizes and it sucks everything
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just took a bunch of volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you fly and then you're passing out
because you were working at the place
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going to go with this story in
like 120 degree houses and you're pouring
[SPEAKER_00]: sweat and you're super dehydrated and all
of a sudden the stone hits you and before
[SPEAKER_00]: it hits you though, you're all like,
hey, I got a six hour flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't slept in like three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take these muscle relaxers
and I'm going to go to sleep on this plane
[SPEAKER_00]: and it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just, I kept jumping up,
hitting my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kept jumping and hitting my head
and then throwing up and then go with
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy eyes and then get back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a treat to be next to on an
airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had taken friends with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had like the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it was, uh, my row and then my
friends were beside us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then the guy behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was the nicest gentleman ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just kept offering me drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gentlemen's airplanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was all, Hey, I have nausea medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pain medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all like, we're probably going to have
to be best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just text.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll text and be side boyfriends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Oh, but Maui is the best place ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in pain because they will take
fucking care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked into a clinic and they didn't
accept my insurance, but the lady doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: was all like, there was all ladies in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, she was, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them back anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just won't charge his insurance
instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphine into the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called an ambulance because my blood
pressure was out of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have a fib and shit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they called an ambulance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ambulance comes and picks me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ambulance driver is all, Oh,
buddy, morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they drive me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tiny Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has one little hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all, Hey, it might take a few minutes
for them to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go inside the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor comes in and he's all,
it looks like a pretty big kidney stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he's all, Hey, we're going to
discharge you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one for your way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking Morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was all, you know, in California,
they'd give you a Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all like, Hey, this guy,
it looks like he's dying over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give him something to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they gave me flow max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had that kidney stone for seven of
the 10 days before I finally passed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a big black rock, but the
whole reason that was it though,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was where I was a fiddling a couple of
days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of days before we left was a
giant grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a, it's a really, really big
legal California legal grow, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember we talked a few days before
you went out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we knew that there's like this
potential to go out there and you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked to you on my way home and I
was telling you like, Hey, I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's meet up and I can get you this and
this and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while I was there, the cookie,
the cookie fellas show up like this van.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally what they're fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it have windows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it have writing on the side?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cookies van.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was a, they put that fucking logo
on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it on somebody's forehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, honestly, I guarantee there's
thousands of people that have that tattoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like instead of a tear, just a C.
[SPEAKER_00]: A C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the, they got their Edgar haircut
and their cookie shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working and I brought PD with me,
of course, because he has to go because he
[SPEAKER_01]: rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is my little fucking worker B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we're busting ass man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in there from literally eight in
the morning to five or six in the
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hot houses are like 110,
115 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so sweaty that like my clothes were
soaked, like I had been swimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't smart enough to bring extra
clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our whole drive home, I just,
I didn't have shirt on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was a tough guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was a real sex pot from a four hour
drive with no shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, I thought that part was
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, the cookie guys show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, they're, uh, bringing all these
clones to, to be flowered, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: at this facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were going, it's a white
labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, they say they grow it or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think what they do is have clean
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow a couple of pounds in the clean
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have those pounds tested and then slide
in, Hey, we have 300 pounds of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they slide in the greenhouse and
the stuff in on that license or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: on that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: California doesn't know they're stupid as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go in and I want to see all these new
ones because they have like what's
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechinar plant names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember this is when cheetah piss,
all those came out, all the rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one had been talking about literally
the white runs, pink runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these runs plants were there and I had
never even seen run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only like barely heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the different, there's multiple
different pound cakes, gelatos and
[SPEAKER_00]: sherbets and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was looking at them and these clones
were like an inch and a half tall tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were like these tiny,
tiny clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they didn't have roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, like you'd pull them out and
look, it was like, it was literally like
[SPEAKER_00]: they had been trying to root for three
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I did find a few with roots that
I ended up, uh, uh, procure procuring to
[SPEAKER_00]: the, to the facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was a scary situation because
these plants were covered in PM covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I mean fucking covered,
I mean like literally, I, I've never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: like baby, baby clones with PM because if
you have PM on the mom plant, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a clone, you just fucking dip it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to see like these tiny infantile
cuts, that means they literally were
[SPEAKER_00]: taking them off of PM covered moms,
not caring, just fucking plugging and
[SPEAKER_00]: going, and then delivering them to
somebody else to let it be their problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: just grow it out for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to put it in a bag
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what I think they're
probably doing is, is some of their moms
[SPEAKER_02]: are probably in a, in a, in a have PM on
them, but dormant, like they think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gone, but once they stick it in those
domes, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that little, those spores just pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were, it was, it was like,
I, I remember even texting you and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: all like, Hey, so I have the, the white
runs and the pink grunts and the LPC 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dude, they're like scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and the rest of this facility's
plants were absolutely fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super healthy moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sun grown with a supplemental D E's on
these like built sized glass houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful setup and hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that fella, I don't want to say his
name and I'm not going to say his name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but him and I have talked for years and
he's done clones for fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for his whole career.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, was telling me like, I have spent
the better part of 10 years, like just
[SPEAKER_00]: harassing, asking, collecting clones,
moms, moms, moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had, what was funny is I got
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a whole little like section,
like this little table section dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: to, I want to say it was the Mendo by
rainbow and the Skittles by rainbow,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the guys had did so well outdoors
in Santa Cruz with those two, those two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that he was all like, so we've been
moving the shit out of these ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Hey, those are mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then partially like some of the stuff
I make is here in California in shit
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, I don't think people know what our
weather's like here sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think they think it's all just like
rainy per or not rainy, sunny,
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, no, we had 116.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slaughtered a pig to this year when it
was 116.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was bad this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dead ass growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the outdoor around this part with
there not being rain anymore is so nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just covered in dirt, dust,
debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been so many pesticides shot in
our area since the thirties and forties
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the things, because we're like the
agricultural fucking capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dust isn't just normal dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's death dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley fever dust, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, I went up there and I just
happened to be there the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys were nice enough and everything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell they were all like,
Oh, you're going to steal our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was before the whole wrench your life
up thing was a thing like piping it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hadn't started hyping it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, one of them was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them turned nice and black,
but it looked just like gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was literally spinning into
gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the runs clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was the white ruts and the
pink ruts and the white runs was all
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to say it was the white with
the ruts crossed together or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, that was me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I don't think you guys spread
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just another bag seed that
you found that looked decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a, what's a cool white strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, then there was the pink
ruts, but at that time they had multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking ruts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know if they still do,
um, but they had the, all their gelatos,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunset Sherbert's, um, I don't know
what Mecca Mecanar is, but they had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being robot name and all kinds
of cheetah piss is named just cheetah
[SPEAKER_00]: piss, this cheetah piss, that cheetah
piss, this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny because, um, I remember
you were talking about cat piss and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of your podcasts leading up to
seeing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people had started to go
like, Oh man, I remember the old pissy
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, you know, and this was years
back, like four or five years ago or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, when we were reminiscing about
the piss strains and just so happens that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have clones that is now cat piss and
gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're all like, yeah, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cheetah cheetah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're much faster than,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has anybody, have you smelled if they
didn't even smell like cat piss at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I have, uh, the cut that's going to
flower right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've held that cut for this fucking long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm finally flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took this long to get clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it, it, it, it's ran through its
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I finally did, I'm doing a cheetah
piss, uh, clone now that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let a friend flower it before I flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he say it was pissy at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't pissy at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, uh, it was, um, but it also wasn't
like, it was like a small tank grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, the plant was really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was really pretty, but so is
gelato and so is Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these are real pretty plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love for some of their names to match
up with what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would, it would honestly, yeah,
there's no way it has cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like every other fucking
cookie plant I've seen, like the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same structure, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the long spheres, the chunky
little buds, you know, I genuinely think
[SPEAKER_02]: that they just take gelato bag seeds just
of the herms and just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never met the woman or anything,
but I'm going to name it after her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what the fuck it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is like, because everything,
all their stuff has little herms on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them have little bag seats on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find them, you grow on some of them or
home run some of them or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find the new home run?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all, Hey, it looks like gelato,
but it has a slight variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that we crossed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, making a run just means making it
successful on IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's literally what the meaning of a
home run is anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, there's so many smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what gets hyped up on social media,
what people talk about on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I couldn't imagine now they have,
uh, Oh, they have some other cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much stuff, but it's all,
it looks all the same, but I got to see
[SPEAKER_00]: like their mothership, if you will,
what comes from the mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it was rough, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel bad for the people who
actually go and pay that money to buy that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because there's no way those plants
are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like without using something before it
gets to you testing the dirty plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not testing that they're,
they're testing clean plants and then
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that they have lots of pounds of
those clean plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, they're just sliding in
because they're not testing every bag
[SPEAKER_00]: that's brought to, to, to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not testing it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing in an eight or a few
grams, having it tested and then telling
[SPEAKER_00]: the state, I have 200 pounds of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want taxes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're all like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 180 of those pounds came from a
greenhouse, but no one knows that it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: gone into these fancy jars and bags
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people like, I, if you remember when
cookies first started getting real big and
[SPEAKER_02]: they started getting the Mylar bags,
do you remember people on IG, like opening
[SPEAKER_02]: up those Mylar bags on video and like just
showing all the mold and people going to
[SPEAKER_02]: the cookie stores and in the store window,
you'd see their little clones that they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: put out there as display and they would
just be filled with bugs and fucking PM
[SPEAKER_02]: and in the store window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they had no clue that they were
displaying this bad as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they were just so inexperienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, two, two things that, that reminds me
of not to talk bad about anybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a high times did a article on swerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went into his grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still find this on THC farmer too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were covered in fucking spiderwebs
and shit and they were taking these
[SPEAKER_00]: closeups where they were all like smelling
the buds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, how the fuck is this a
centerfold?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: High times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody in high times caught it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, none of them caught it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like, it's, it wasn't something
that you like catch as a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see it every fucking where they
were big top tents in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even that, like I remember the
pictures not even being that like good
[SPEAKER_02]: tailed and you could still see the PM and
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different time, a different era,
a bygone era.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we always knew what spider mites
looked like on leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were a grower, especially from
California, that was spider mites and a
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillar damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for outdoor growers, it's like,
you know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're going to be dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember that article and looking at
those plants and I was all, this is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is like who works there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys ever seen cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, does this look normal to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, so there was that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just, I had another one that was
the second one that I wanted to bring up
[SPEAKER_00]: and now I can't remember what,
oh, the, um, when they were asking burner
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, what was cookies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was all, oh, it's F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should have told people right
then that it was just some sort of bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed stuff that they had got from the Bay
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much purple weed in the Bay
at the time, whether it was granddaddy or
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel or the fucking SR 71.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen so many mutants in Urkel
crossing and deep Urkel lines where it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like OGKB and OGKB looks like Urkel
because they both have the slow trait and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get the weird leaf patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so I could imagine there was a
herm with, maybe there was a herm with an
[SPEAKER_00]: OG or a herm with an Urkel and they got a
bag of Urkel and they're all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that OG hermed in a grow room and
threw some pollen on the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have this plant that looks,
could be cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, this story could be different,
but I could imagine that these were the
[SPEAKER_00]: things and they found the, you know,
a couple of pounds or ounces or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: that had a few seeds in them and they
decided to become growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's their F one, their F one was
the first generation bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't sure if F one was a cross to
DERB or F one was part of DERB,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it wasn't a Formula One sports car or
airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, that's such a weird plant to
pick the DERB.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an odd plant to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've never, ever seen anything
come out of any cookie cross that
[SPEAKER_00]: resembles DERB at all, ever in history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they knew, like,
I think they pulled the name out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Popular strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, they didn't know they were
attaching like a South African sativa to
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would 100% show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because I think they were,
if I, I can't remember exactly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to say it was like granddaddy
or cherry pie with a Florida OG and DERB
[SPEAKER_00]: and poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something along that mixture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cherry pie was supposed to be one
hybrid and then cookies was supposed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: another hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one had GDP and one didn't,
if I remember correctly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or one had DERB and one didn't,
something stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I remember cherry pie before the
cookie fiasco, like the cookie stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember having cherry pie and I got it
from friends at Dark Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dark Heart story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dark Heart Road, the dark,
dark road of Dark Heart Nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember I had friends that were,
that were the growers, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a fancy name for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like how you have baristas that
make coffee, but they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're making a coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I worked at the coffee shop,
we weren't labeled a barista.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fucking would make you a sandwich and
shit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't a fucking sandwich artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking should have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have drew on it with my dick
Twinkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to dick Twinkie with cheese,
baby girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dark Heart Nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get a little bit into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before cookies came like to prevalence,
there was cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was around and then, uh, Burner's name
got attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like cookies, cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant was just called fucking cherry
pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what it was called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't, it wasn't nice plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had like a menthol thing going on with
like a, a berry thing going on turned
[SPEAKER_00]: purple and nice look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cherry pie was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Heart had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, Dark Heart never,
and then they had the, another one they
[SPEAKER_00]: called three Kings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, uh, it was, it was, I think it was
like a sour OG Bubba or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that they tried to say ended
up coming from later known as the cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cherry pie and the three Kings were
supposedly those guys is like first
[SPEAKER_00]: rendezvous with, uh, cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that was before they were,
you know, this and that and the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I guess they were well known in the
Bay at the time already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because the rap scene and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but they weren't well known in
the cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I had both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three Kings was, uh, I would still
grow cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did this pop up by the way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are, these are lumpies old
pictures of cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were some of my favorite pictures,
the earliest ones that I saw, just so
[SPEAKER_02]: people can get an idea of the plant we're
talking about of what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's her, that, that's his
status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lump status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that is cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the fun part about cherry pie is
it did have this menthol very cherry thing
[SPEAKER_00]: on the finishing touch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like that whole pastry name,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of started like, well,
we had cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we get in this girl scout
cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: That started the pastry craze for those
knuckleheads.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dark heart nursery, um, dark heart for
the people who aren't from, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were putting clones at all of our,
uh, medical dispensaries, Harbor sides
[SPEAKER_00]: after blues blue sky or blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: After blue sky was like the place there
was a place there and there was a place
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the, uh, like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what was, what was the blue dot one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember the Santa Cruz place,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They had blue dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was down South.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had these two shops and like
literally at blue sky and the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Cruz Berkeley's patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Berkeley Berkeley's patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was another one though that you would,
these places would get like a few thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would already, if you were late,
there would be lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going like 11 o'clock at night,
staying in a parking lot, uh, with a buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was a plant I wanted,
you know, and it never was, it was hard
[SPEAKER_00]: finding fucking clones back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard finding clones, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sourcing real legit, someone you knew that
like knew their shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I sourced like a sour grapes
cut from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I got grape stomper from,
which, um, that's where, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the SCDC cut was SCDC cut was
being sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the AK 47, the white widow,
the Urkel, the SR 71, that blue sky was
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it was really hard to get fucking
clones there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus they'd only let you buy like five
at a time or some weirdo shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more people could get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, after those places got like
fucked, like those places got ran out,
[SPEAKER_00]: they shut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city was constantly after them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harborside really took off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Harborside, Steve D'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was learning how to pad pockets
before other people were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think Steve was learning how to
like juggle certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Corporate people's balls in their mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking cleaning them like golf
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: One by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was getting these places shut down,
but he was able to stay open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what brought Harborside to like
mega thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their TV show and all that bullshit
that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, that's the... Have you seen lately
that he's been like railing against Prop
[SPEAKER_02]: 64, even though he's one of the people
that pushed it through?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he realized, oh, I'm not fucking
rich enough to compete with the rich
[SPEAKER_02]: people that I put in power.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I'm a millionaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're billionaires.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just told me to fuck off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling everyone, please vote no on
64.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to ruin everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to get cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't going to be illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to crack this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were just using the National
Guard last year to eradicate outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growths in California in a legal
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were a legal state,
but they were eradicating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't going after the cartel
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were using it to go after mom and
pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going... Dude, do you have any
times I've had to deal with fucking code
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just finally, the sergeant of the police
department, Olson City, he finally said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking your name off the list so they
stop harassing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was all, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like after years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Piggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dark Heart Nursery sort of started
coming along with Harborside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dark Heart was filling Harborside's
shelves with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in one time, they were very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they had 10 strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the cherry pie, the three kings,
you know, and a white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had this one called a chocolate hash
berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the purple caper things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of how I got offered some
stuff from Dark Heart because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for breeders at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for house projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember basically wanting me to be an
employee and anything I made was theirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just work on their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In essence, but from my grow and give them
all my best stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like a per cut sale percentage or...
That sounds like how like the Dutch used
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make us fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just send us the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send you some money later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send you money later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dark Heart had like a monopoly on
clones, like legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was little guys who were still
trying to compete and they were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: fine, but they had to find specific things
that Dark Heart didn't monopolize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Dark Heart would have these 10
inch fucking beast clones with these huge
[SPEAKER_00]: stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell that the plant had been
blasted with God knows what to explode
[SPEAKER_00]: with growth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonstop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look, you're all like super steroids,
nonstop, super fucking carcinogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, you guys are just, just eh,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to the home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get fucking tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares what's in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares that I shot the shit out of it
with the dirtiest of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyhow, my friends who all have worked
for Dark Heart quit in the past five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Heart had to cut a Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine went and bought a
thousand Stardog cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I think he actually did buy a
thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 500 per grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he calls me about day 40 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, Hey, can you come and look at
my plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was all, something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go over and I look and it would be
like pretty plant, plant that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty plant without resin, without
structure, like without density,
[SPEAKER_00]: just puff balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty plant, puff ball, no resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty plant, puff ball, no resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puff ball, no resin plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also started throwing out little banana
herbs, like just little, little pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could tell that they were the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the same plant, but they
weren't off of the same mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly the healthy plants probably came
from one mom and puff ball plants came
[SPEAKER_00]: from another mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what I've been learning from
the, the HPLB, whatever the fuck you're
[SPEAKER_02]: called, is that some moms, like you can
take clones from the top part and it won't
[SPEAKER_02]: be as, like it won't have as high of a
viroid count.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take it from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can take them to the same exact
plant and have different virus load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can have different viral loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually seen that with a thousand
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually could see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, mind you, this was way before this
was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was way before anyone had spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it dudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it fucking dudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had full duds, half duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant looks pretty fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of dudded, little dudded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start thinking like, okay,
this, these plants are all getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants would be on the same fucking
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally the same table, flood to drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody had, I was pulling plants up
to check root systems, big white,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy root systems, healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves were healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pH is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything seems right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, fucking plants wrapped and I couldn't
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I start contacting Dark Heart and
tell them about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey, um, we're seeing a lot of
dudding plants, like from the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up pulling Stardog from the
menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they never wanted to admit to me
that these plants were dudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sold millions of clones,
like millions of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were buying thousands at a time and
tens of thousands of people were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did HPLV explode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dark Heart nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody who has a hip new strain,
Dark Heart started pulling in every
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hip new strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When glue hit the scene, Dark Heart had
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream hit the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Heart had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When fucking, uh, the cookies hit the
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherbert hit the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that hit the scene that was
popular, they were getting rid of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like Blackberry, Romulan,
they had fucking a legit Romulan cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a legit Romulan cut that they got
rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got rid of it for, yeah, it's not,
it's not in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you're going to get cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but the shallow thinking process of
these companies, you're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Blue Dream was one of the most popular
plants explode onto the scene that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: actually seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every outdoor grower, crew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the problem was, is that not everybody
had the real Blue Dream cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were getting, yes, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Blue Dream people are,
Oh, it's not that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a bull fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still pull out my Blue Dream cut every
now and then, and just fuck people over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, it's fucking Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys just got shitty Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing happened with Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact same fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glue cut that came, uh, from,
um, um, I almost said this really,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, um, uh, what did he go by?
[SPEAKER_00]: Josie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josie and Lone Wadi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josie sent me, uh, glue and, uh,
uh, it's funny how far back Josie and I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was before he, he, his screen
picture, his little avatar on the site was
[SPEAKER_00]: of Josie Wells, but his name wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he has his name became his avatar
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's, he's so nice to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was just a really, really Josie
was her sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lone Wadi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I didn't really know Lone,
but Josie was real sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, um, I know CSI had a project going
with them at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a project going with them at the end
and, uh, he was always so fricking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some of his seeds that were
like unlabeled projects with like when
[SPEAKER_00]: Uzbekistan came out, uh, the pre-sove,
uh, whatever pre-Soviet came in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed went bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow he was working with a few things
and he sent me some stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, the pre-Soviet high thing,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that plant is,
but he must've liked it to breathe with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like nine different plants called
pre-Soviet Afghani.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, he sent me a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me some, uh, he called it like
cherry fuel or cherry gas or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he knew I was a cherry fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you do other things, um,
so, uh, but that's what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those plants got watered down
because of people getting bag seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it and saying it's glue for,
or specifically with blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when, when it blew up,
there was a company called Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle seeds, which I remember in the
Emerald triangle, people didn't like them
[SPEAKER_02]: because they weren't, they weren't from
the Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a Spanish company mass
producing a blueberry haze in seed form
[SPEAKER_02]: and then a humble seed organization,
I believe sold the same exact seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to, don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They at least sold a blue dream that was
not the same blue dream, their own
[SPEAKER_02]: creation, if not the same exact seeds,
the Emerald triangle were selling under
[SPEAKER_02]: their label.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humble seed org, when they first came
in too, I had so many friends telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were bad for lack of other
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't from the, this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have these.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the, that's Emerald triangle
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Emerald triangle.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got those two mixed up then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do all the time because they
both released blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both had the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who it was then Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had friends who were just like,
this is horseshit and they're spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: horseshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to dark heart, dark heart spread
HPLV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to really explain the
epicenter that they caused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like a very hard to say in a,
in a, in a viral situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just like kind of take COVID for
example.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I'm not going to use the 19 part,
so I'll just use the COVID name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say a virus, let's say a new virus,
a new viroid hits, hits at humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an epicenter of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a thousand people who live
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, all those thousand people moved to
a new state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, and that's kind of what dark heart
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when they did this, it was at the,
like this new peak of the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: the new peak of clone sharing,
the new peak of all these seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: new peak of, of, of clone internet sales
to clone internet sales, going to dark
[SPEAKER_02]: heart, picking up a tray of clones,
taking them on their, their internet
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram page and moving their money all
over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then dude, I know of people who have
sent them to other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same fucking cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that virus shouldn't have spread at the
speed it spreads through our industry
[SPEAKER_02]: without assistance, without something
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best part was that after everybody
figured out, oh shit, dark heart might've
[SPEAKER_02]: been the epicenter for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they're like, ha, we got a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will sell you a cure for these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they never said that they were the
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the season, you know, that all this is
happening, but they did say, we will sell
[SPEAKER_02]: you a cure and it is the real cure for
HBLB.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also dark hearts clones dried up at these
shops, harborside for a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you couldn't find dark heart cuts and
other that's when like purple city
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics sort of kind of like blew up
because they were able to like fill
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves and these other orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden dark heart comes back
and what they did, they knew they had
[SPEAKER_00]: sickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just, uh, they took the,
uh, God, I was just talking to you about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, like before we came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, uh, and now I'm drawing the blank
on what the tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tissue cultured everything,
re-brought it along, built it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that they were probably
buying clones and selling clones so they
[SPEAKER_00]: could keep their business going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they were shutting down one facility to
clean it while they were still selling
[SPEAKER_00]: nasties over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this, this facility was back up
and running with new clean cuts from the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they shut down the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing we know about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hit or miss on whether it is no
get that, like, even if they do Mary stem
[SPEAKER_02]: culture, they try to not get any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot what they call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with their, um, their
vascular tissue, but to make sure none of
[SPEAKER_02]: that gets along, goes along with the Mary
stem is really hard and really
[SPEAKER_02]: unpredictable until it's thrown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, you don't know until you grow it
out and you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend, uh, on Instagram and
that's what he's doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a ton of tissue culture and,
uh, super smart kid, super fucking God,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys are really fucking smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us older dudes, our brains aren't
like, yeah, we're slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, we're so much slower than you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I've done so much LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and if, so like sometimes I'll stumble
on my words and it's not because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I'm like trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because my brain and my mouth,
they, they're not like communicating
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did have a part of his colon removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember, that was actually between
the brain and the mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seizures really fucked my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seizures really fucked that that
pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's my excuse?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a seizure yet, but I'm brain
damaged drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did those too, but with also the
other good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was, he was telling me about his
tissue culture and that some of them they
[SPEAKER_00]: can, they can get, and if they're clean,
the plants are come out clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on they found traces of the
virus in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, how do we, how do we go
about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that virus load stay as a trace or is
that virus load going to grow as the,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the plant grows?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they said it takes like two
years of testing and constant testing to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure it isn't showing up in the
American culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what was so scary is like,
he was telling me, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get it, it's like, you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like herpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you always, now your herpes can be
like unnoticeable or you can be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that have like the herpes or the
herpes, you know, the herpes, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Twinkie Dick herpes where it's always
dripping, where your Twinkie Dick's just
[SPEAKER_00]: dripping up a storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what's fun, man, about not
Twinkie Dick herpes, but like knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: people and like actually putting myself
out there more as like meeting more
[SPEAKER_00]: people, like intelligent people that I can
share knowledge and they share,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good at certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good at certain things and they
can, you know, we can kind of communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that there is a cure for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been working on certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain things are showing promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I hope it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we have a plant that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when we had it tested,
it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you said, it's going to be a
couple of years before I actually get to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll break my heart after it's been a
year ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it pops back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's possible though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will absolutely just be a fucking
gut punch, but we'll see where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was with a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we sprayed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, it's things that you can
do at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to inject it into a
specific flow or xylem or any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it into the roots and we put it
onto the entire plant and it tested clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing was seeing that the
plant grew resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a first start, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant looked like what it was
supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the flowers looked like what it's
supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything was, now I didn't smoke the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't smoke the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't, humans ingest this,
the thing that we've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, people actually take it as
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But combustibility, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can eat things, but if you smoke it,
it's probably not going to be super
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of cancer stuff just comes from the
combustion of certain things and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we're at with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went with the cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy their flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Lord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gelato times gelato in bread cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're losing so much because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottlenecking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even really want to call it like
bottlenecking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottlenecking is like braiding and
intentionally done usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is just idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Washington apples, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were kids, this is always my
analogy for what's going on in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were young, Washington apples were
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind of ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were off a little bit and oblong with
knots and stuff, but they were crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, Oh my God, tastes like apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you go get a red delicious apple and
it tastes like wet foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was because they bred for looks on
the table more than they bred for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And packaging and transport and all that
crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have you seen, have you seen the square
watermelons, the Chinese bread for packing
[SPEAKER_02]: and shipping?
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have no flavor at all,
but they're square.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can ship them easier and they pack
into boxes easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares if they don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So God, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's my concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with the cannabis is like every
breeder and it's not like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: you bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something with gelato or you've had
something with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you're taking ruts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking sherbert and you're
reversing it to more ruts and gelato and
[SPEAKER_00]: sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody else is finding clones
from those and they're reversing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: more ruts and gelato and sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So purple punch really did a number on the
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many people who bred with punch
and so many plants look like punch and
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then I'm not shit talking purple
punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't it's, I don't want the flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to get blown the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant does me fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people need higher strength than I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one does me fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, but basically what we're
getting down to is gelato purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't, I, to be honest,
I rarely even see purple punch stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't, that was such a small wave
and it seemed like, for two years,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody hit everything to punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now it's just back to gelato or
cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's back to cookies with different names,
different names, cookies, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sherb, gelato fucking, what, whatever
you're going to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the same thing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all cookies to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's all the same base genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all has a similar look.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're different expressions of the same
exact genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the more people breed them back
to each other, even if it's, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: intentionally breeding, trying to inbreed
for, for like uniformity, that's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of recesses are going to have
them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, do you remember when
cookies first came, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was that little rabbit turd looking
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this little, little black
plant with like these little tiny buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember somebody sent me that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super curious about it because he
was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always about the oddities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like duck foot and shit was
my thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it and I grew it and it was
like, oh yeah, that's, that was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could never really grow it though,
because it's so light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not, it wasn't good enough
quality to like mass produce it to get
[SPEAKER_00]: like top tier money in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when I put it on the market and
then I told people, oh no, it's Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the time that's when it first
started to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people started telling me stories
about, oh my God, it's not like eating a
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookie, but it's like the box,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like after the cookies are gone and you
smell the box, I'm like, cardboard?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like fucking cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are you telling me my weed smells
like cardboard?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, then there was this new one,
the second one, the animal forum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the forum, the forum cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one had like a little more chunk
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when animal cookies came out
and these two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it 08, 07?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was, it was 2010, 09, right in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always put the 09 label on it,
but I didn't see anything about it till
[SPEAKER_02]: 2010 and the animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these two dudes went and did a YouTube
review on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, it tastes just like
animal crackers, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you smell that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and everybody's just like,
oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the smell of animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they all smelled it and were
like, man, it does smell like animal
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, it's not like gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that whole, uh, psychosomatic
thinking something and you find what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then that one too, the animal
cookies, there were these stories about
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, it was this OG with Girl Scout
cookies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one and this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people started trying to take credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they were like, oh yeah, I created
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then it was really easy to pass
shit off because everybody was new to the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, not the internet, but these
websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like all these cannabis websites just
started popping up, popping up,
[SPEAKER_00]: popping up like tons of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could just go in there and have a
picture of something you grew and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I created this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when cookies came out,
um, I was the first one to put it out in
[SPEAKER_02]: seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shortly thereafter, swerve started
selling cook cookies and people were
[SPEAKER_02]: punking him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was, he was just like relabeling
SFB or some other OG hybridist cookies and
[SPEAKER_02]: selling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, BC bud depot also did the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are growing out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even related to OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fucking God, but Jesus Christ,
the purpose in God, but, um, I wish that
[SPEAKER_00]: never happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that company's, that company's
fuck shit up for like 10 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they fucked shit up for other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like God bud was from Jordan of the
islands.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did good with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take the name, slap it on their shit
and just like whatever seeds we got right
[SPEAKER_02]: now is what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people don't know about BC bud depot,
like, I mean, it's one of the main
[SPEAKER_02]: advertisers in high times for many years,
just smart about what you're buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's a very well-known thing
that's been going on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, know what you're buying,
know your breeder, ask your breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: questions, ask your breeder questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how are you going to ask a breeder
at BC bud depot questions?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a receptionist that
responds back to your fucking email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all like buy our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do people, and here's my question
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do people really still buy their seeds
with all of the breeders out now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't, how do they exist?
[SPEAKER_02]: They capture all the new people,
just like Cali connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anybody that's been around for,
you know, more than five years knows their
[SPEAKER_02]: gig and like their gimmick and they don't
buy it, but there's a constant influx of
[SPEAKER_02]: new buyers constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what these companies rely on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They rely on you not knowing, not having
done the research, not knowing,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you're going to buy cookies from
them, they're, they know that you probably
[SPEAKER_02]: have never fucking grown cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't even know what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I said the story about
when I started doing like these huge grows
[SPEAKER_00]: up in a small town called Squaw Valley and
the ones up at three rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny if it's, we had talked about
somebody else who was talking about stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: out of three rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, I was producing tons
of shit out of three rivers anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the guy that was up there who owned the
land had bought like thousands of dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of seeds, legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he ended up putting like 15,
16 grand in the seeds when I went up there
[SPEAKER_00]: to, they had grown the year before and got
eight pounds of the worst garbage ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grew like thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they asked me to come up and I was
like, yeah, man, I will make this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a thousand pound grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he pulls out all these seeds he bought
and PPP, remember that purple power plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had BC Bud Depot's Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC Bud Depot's God Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC Bud Depot's The Perks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And God, they had another one that was God
Bud and something mixed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had already popped the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were already little plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had taken, at the time I was growing
a lot of this plant, that we were calling
[SPEAKER_00]: a white skunk or white rhino, white bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally just filled up,
there was a mountain and it ran downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started at the top and we just did
rows going down so gravity could water and
[SPEAKER_00]: just get little ditches with little
offshoots to each stump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had like 300 gallon res,
300 gallon res, 300 gallon res,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up the nutrients, turn them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would just shoot down the pipes
into the little shoots that the guys made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they ran down, they would offshoot
to each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was no plastic, no anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, growing thousands of plants is
fucking rough back then, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you and two other dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, he wanted to grow these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a place over by the old horse
corral that didn't have anything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a nice square.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went over and planted all of his
seeds in that horse corral.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power plant one, he called it purple
power plant and it was purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if pure power plant turns
purple, but that company could have had
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the weirdest little plant,
but it was whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every one of their blueberries were
full-blown herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one was full-blown herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was one of the best blueberry
smells I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back in three rivers stayed
blueberry, like legitimate blueberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it had more fucking herm balls on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like, the smell's great,
but dude, half of it is balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the Godbud, they were all just
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the pictures that they used
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally old fucking Dutch shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even good Dutch stuff, like Dutch
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one of them that was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a grape jelly, but the buds
were small and airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't something that you'd want to
grow, but there was something in there
[SPEAKER_00]: that gave it like a grape jelly smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had something at the time that made
it perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the fuck they were
using, but that was kind of like when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like to show him like, Hey buddy,
you can't just like go into High Times
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine and like this company and this
company, they're paying a lot of money to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in that magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in that magazine because
they're cool or good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't earn their spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of accolades.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking Incredible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver Island Sea Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually bought those and ran them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already at that point seen BC Buddy
Po trashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do still, I did order seeds a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I had to have the little paper
and mark my little thing down and put a
[SPEAKER_00]: money order in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like a haystrain and I got some
stuff from Sanny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was later though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had got a couple of different hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, the garbage barge, um, uh,
Boo-Roo, Boo-Roo-Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Randy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the old sensei seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up changing the name,
but it was called the Randy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it became like sweet tooth
or blockhead later on in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to send you the, I'll send you a
picture of it, but it's in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that I did with garbage barge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, God damn it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The younger ones, the brains, the brains
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm pretty sure it's what ended up
becoming either sweet tooth or blockhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blockhead is like a project 19 cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just some weird like African
sativa hybrid of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was probably blockhead if I know it
was one of those two, but it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boo Randy or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from the region that they had got
the seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the first pack of seeds
I ever ordered was those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even remember why I wanted
those that specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What pulled you into that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I had to order that one for
$12.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember ordering like some can of
hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out something called less shades
at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a Lesotho haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember ordering it and thinking,
God, it's going to be bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember getting it and thinking,
why did I order this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a South African Lesotho and a haze?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be 25 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me grow this my entire year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did I think that that was going to be
something for me?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think it's funny that I see a
lot of these projects now from guys who
[SPEAKER_00]: are just like trying to get their name
onto the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it, they're trying to say,
it's like, oh, this African haze or this
[SPEAKER_00]: tie strain or this oh, God, Vietnamese
strain or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them that you see are
legitimately sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them look like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see some of them look like
fucking cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're all like Caps Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when he said his nine week Colombian,
I was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot he also had a land race Japanese
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was, mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been super fucking nice to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we message and email and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mac isn't any of those things.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can remake Mac from Colorado flow,
super lemon haze and like a few other
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the lemon part that constantly shows
up and it's off projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've known Jaws since Ken is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was my first troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really bad at trolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he has like all these alien cookie
candy, candy cookie aliens, alien rocks
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could imagine that and lemon haze
type or I don't even know if it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: pure lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was that really soft lemon plant
that was going around right a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years before that came out before Matt
came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember growing it and I was like,
wow, that's really interesting the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: looked because at least puffier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they kind of look like how a CDC looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was like almost like Northern
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it has a structure to it,
but it had this lemony zestiness to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I still don't know what the plant
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was given the plant and they were
like, I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really intrigued by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super resonated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Erase all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine purple punch with lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as resonated as purple punch,
but for the time fucking resonated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't as powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a resonance purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little more of an oil
stickiness to it, but it had a soft like,
[SPEAKER_00]: not like a lemon chemical, like a,
like a lemon peel, like a sweet,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Meyer lemon type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't live in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was faint, but it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew it for a while and I was like,
I could like, you wanted to smoke it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause like that flavor yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd want to put joints out halfway so
you could smoke it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the half joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That joint got thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm terrible at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kevin, I don't know if it gets thrown
out and I want like, I want a new fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: green one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that other shit that's,
but I just smoked that shit till it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am such a priss now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, I only want good fresh
green shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all the fresh turks right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you, have you seen the brick tech
thing that I used to show that to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: The fucking, it looks like an anal torture
device.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a glass probe that eats and it
connects to a bowl and it, and it has like
[SPEAKER_02]: holes on the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you suck it, you're sucking air
down through this like heat vortex that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes into the bowl into a bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually like, you hit a bong
of vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get some of the most amazing,
like a lot of the turks that normally you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't get through vaporization or
combustion for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can dial it in so perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many different flavors that you
normally wouldn't expect it to be in a bud
[SPEAKER_02]: that you smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they make them anymore,
but they, they should, if they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I first started tonight,
not put fire on the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my lighter up high and like,
like trying to use the heat from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first like time,
like I was young when I started learning
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the first time where I
was like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that tastes way fucking different
back then it was brick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish people could see some of the good
breakaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some that would come in
uncompressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really nice every once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my dad had a, so my dad would go to
Mexico and bring it hundreds of keys and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would all be labeled in different
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've said the story,
but I'm going to say it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there would be like black ones that
were wrapped in black and those were like
[SPEAKER_00]: for his personal, like these you keep,
then it'd be green, red, orange and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of them was a step down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he finally got caught,
he got caught with 180 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's why we'd have to take
off, you know, and like disappear for some
[SPEAKER_00]: years when I was really little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is the, like the guy that like,
I always went to when I had questions
[SPEAKER_00]: about anything from Mexican weed,
Mexico weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why he was all like,
oh, the orange buds, that all comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that was coming up from
Mexico in the fucking seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was all like, you know, and he was
all even like a lot of this green piney
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was all like the skunks that I was
growing in the eighties was coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mexican seeds from the seventies,
like that he was importing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was his skunks, like not like
skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like the plants that they were
all like, God damn it smells like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually smelled like skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they called it skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it fucking skunk, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a guy, he's,
they're all, they're all passed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't feel bad using their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went by Mikey Dale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when my dad left, so my dad worked
the fields, they were field workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where he met all the young,
the Mexican kids, they all grew up
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then when they all went back to
Mexico, my dad stayed here and he was in
[SPEAKER_00]: high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would come back for the summer and
they would bring weed with them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd make like little pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said out of like the grape vines,
cause you could hollow them out and like
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was also, by the time I graduated
high school, he was going to play
[SPEAKER_00]: professional baseball and he got drafted
by the angels and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead my mom got pregnant and she
wouldn't let him leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's all like, well, I got to make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hooked up with his old buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was just driving back and forth into
the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, most of the time he didn't
actually have to go into Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just meet down on one of the
border areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just pulled up and they would be
waiting and load up the fuck could be
[SPEAKER_00]: loaded off and gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he still would tell me like,
and before he passed, I was growing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was growing a lot of fucking really
good weed and he would compare it to some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the stuff that he would have back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he would say most of the stuff that I
was growing now was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way fucking better, but there were still a
few that he would get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but those growers, those generational
growers, those family growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they did get run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they lost all their land.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got run out by cartels and,
and big money and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those people who were growing and my
dad was getting it from, they no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their genetics are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the new shit had growers
came in there, they were trying to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I've seen their grows in,
in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen how they grow it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on actual cartel grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've been told that I was going to
be kidnapped and all kinds of crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could go and build grows and wild
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I needed to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so dude, some of the fucking craziest
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so anyways, uh, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally will just have like.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sack of seeds and they were just
throwing them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would fucking corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff growing out and males and females and
it didn't fucking matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good growers knew not to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good growers, cold males, and they
actually brand what they wanted for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, um, in what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the really good hash, most of
their hash was made like from the year
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants that they would harvest,
they would sit all fucking winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would start growing the next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when they started making the
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was plants are old and beat up and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lane and dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was easier for that fucking
separation of the trichome, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they just sit there and tap,
tap, tap, tap, tap that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap it over these seed screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the also I also was told like learn
from some of the older guys who did serve
[SPEAKER_00]: a Vietnam that they would, they would,
uh, bury the cannabis even when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would ferment it and then they
would smoke it and it would be like
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinogens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what DJ short in his book referred to
as African black magic, which is that
[SPEAKER_02]: fermented Malawi cob, um, like buried in
a, in a corn cob and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, uh, the friend who told me that
story, he's actually in hospice right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still with us too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but he was like, like one of my dad's
best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he knows all like my dad's old stories
and everything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he was telling me he did, I think two
tours in Vietnam and he was not a big
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most of the soldiers, that's what
they were getting, you know, heroin and he
[SPEAKER_00]: would spend a cannabis guy's whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoked weed from the sixties,
you know, they're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he said that they started to
finally like start making trade for
[SPEAKER_00]: American cigarettes, uh, foods,
you know, candies and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would start giving them heroin,
but they also would offer them weed buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was all like, some of these buds
were weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause some of them were tight,
like they took and tied them on a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was all, some of them were
like, like rotten brown, weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was all, but they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like their version of like cannabis
opium, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, he was all like,
that stuff would be buried for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how long, but he buried it
fresh too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like dry it, bury it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so it was cured underground,
but by carrying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was said that he would like
hallucinate and like go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to show you what this, this anal
torture one looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like electric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this end attaches to a bowl and it
never touches the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only heats it to a certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's, I don't think they sell it
anymore, but it was seriously like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy this company if I could,
because it was, it was that old
[SPEAKER_02]: revolutionary of a, of a thing for me to
smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine because all vapes are kind of the
same, you know, vaporizers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a hot plate and they exactly the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not doing ceramic place
secondary heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actual contact with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're heating something that's
heating something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single vape I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's always this, uh, popcorn taste
to it that never, that's always there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this doesn't have that because you can
dial it in so perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's secondary heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not touching the butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, I do hope the company gets,
I remember the last time I talked to him,
[SPEAKER_02]: someone wanted to buy one and they said
they didn't have any American plugs for
[SPEAKER_02]: them, which whatever that means.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, there is so worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody who wants to sample or,
or try any cannabis and get the real like
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor profile and really nail it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the easiest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're not, you're not tasting the
chlorophyll and all the other stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to move through,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't really like, yeah,
I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're wanting to get that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want that essence and that's what
you just want the oils and that's all it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the combustion gives you a different
high, like compare the fleet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to just pure flavor,
this thing, I can imagine, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I thought it would be a lot
lighter because I don't know why,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you don't get as much smoke in your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't feel the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get as high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't think you're going to get as
high for whatever reason, but I always end
[SPEAKER_00]: up doing the mumble jumble like after we
come from the time when if we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: choke, we weren't smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you've got to call it off,
but yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, man, my weed never makes
me fucking cough anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so smooth now, you know, like I'm
always all, Oh, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't cough anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these things are just so filled
with shit and ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs are just so fucking wrecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke some of that dirty dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't smoke dirty dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even know some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we don't even know what dirty dirt
we smoke to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, God, no, God, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nastiest of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have made through a whole nother
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have done a whole nother episode and
I'm sure we can pile down a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand more probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, this is, this is a smellboat
episode two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time we actually have a time for
the release of the beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should have them out in a week,
which might mean two for us, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 is the max.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 is the max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there might be five of one of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look, but I think
it's 10 packs max and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we literally from that one,
that'll be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really want something,
um, I don't flood shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just don't flood my markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have, I never will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you buy some of my seeds,
you're getting something that other
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfuckers won't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's, it's just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think, uh, I think picking these
ones first is, uh, I think people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to like freak the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, that rainbow sister, dude,
that chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still keep the cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have her?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have rainbow, rainbow sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kill it for me when I see
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another one that I haven't shown
off as much because she's kind of ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only rainbow I've ever found that
was ugly, but it really pulls the OG like
[SPEAKER_00]: the old school, old school OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but good God, like you literally could
like squeeze the buds and it would stick
[SPEAKER_00]: to the wall for all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just stick it on there and it
wouldn't fucking come off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that sap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I remember my dad told me that
when the first Afghanis came through,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the one thing they noticed is
that you could stick it on a wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all said like, it would stick to
the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were so surprised by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pops when you smoke it, the,
the resin pods inside, there's like these
[SPEAKER_00]: little pods and they have like sap inside
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you smoke it, you'll actually see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like fireworks and people that
are inexperienced smell like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to flush it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to learn to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I've only had that happen with a few
different strains, uh, where the pods get
[SPEAKER_00]: so filled with fucking resin that like,
as you're smoking it, they like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sparkle the motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, one of the weirdest ones got,
I hate saying this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the SFV by rainbow that did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That SFV that cut so weird, but man,
there's some good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some good, that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that was when you brought up Swerve
was passing off SFV cut cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all like, why didn't you just say what
the fuck it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a real SFV, that's a fucking
banger, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now he wanted cookies and cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would get it to him.
