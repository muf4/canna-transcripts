[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_02]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_02]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_02]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_02]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I was thinking of like,
where to go with this because you've done
[SPEAKER_02]: other shows before, but I think like,
briefly, not even briefly, like as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to go into on your start,
obviously, where your interest started,
[SPEAKER_02]: how you got specifically into like a very
niche area of like the landrace heirloom,
[SPEAKER_02]: older lines, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have questions from people in our
Discord and I want to talk some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: lines obviously that you carry so it can
shine some light on some of those too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus I'm interested in a lot of them and I
have a bunch, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's cool that people have sent in
questions because it's always good to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer that for people because often I
sort of don't realize the extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do because people mention it,
but you know, when people come to the site
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're a bit overwhelmed by the sheer
quantity of stuff on there and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, for me, it was something
that getting into this sort of niche,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it were, was more the growing up in the
UK in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my, in fact, all of my first
encounters with cannabis was through stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that friends of mine parents had,
you know, so sort of boomer generation
[SPEAKER_00]: people who would still in that era go to
Nepal and places and bring back stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the people who I was talking to
about it were also of that generation and
[SPEAKER_00]: would sort of regale me with anecdotes
about smuggling hash back from Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_00]: and this type of thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That triggered your interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was that that was the real cache,
the real kind of, you know, mythologized
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff was that old, old type of old school
cannabis, you know, that was anyway what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of raised in the context in which
I grew up into cannabis was one in which
[SPEAKER_00]: that was always had the biggest sort of
prestige attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these were these old kind of
hippy type characters, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's probably a slightly I mean,
they definitely were back in the 60s,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that those, you know, they were doing
the hippy trail and stuff and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: scams like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as teenagers, we would
occasionally like, you know, I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of very early 90s and things would
obviously being so close to Amsterdam in
[SPEAKER_00]: England anyway, you do we were seeing that
people were starting to grow but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: the indoor indoor kind of domestic
production in the UK didn't really take
[SPEAKER_00]: off in a big way until the late 90s,
early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly, in the space of a couple of
years, imported cannabis just disappeared
[SPEAKER_00]: from the UK completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most imports anyway, if you're in the
UK, unless you knew someone were pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking shit Moroccan hash, to be honest,
throughout that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you didn't know someone you could
get, you know, nice Swazi red,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of West African, Nigerian,
and you could still get good, good
[SPEAKER_00]: Moroccan and you'd see Lebanese you'd see
very seldom see like really good Afghan it
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that you'd need to go to Holland or
someone somewhere to actually find someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who could get the real stuff because most
of what most of the Afghan Pakistani type
[SPEAKER_00]: hash by that point that you'd see in the
UK was bump even though people didn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to realize you know, yeah, but anyway,
so but if we did if we did see like what
[SPEAKER_00]: we would call skunk and that kind of stuff
in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd sit and I'd sit with my friends
around their house and stuff and their
[SPEAKER_00]: parents would just be like, Oh,
this stuff's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you fucking touching all crap,
you know, and they just give us this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of lecture about how awful it is and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was kind of my perception
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, you know, friends of mine
who are Australians would basically have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if they came around and they
saw and these are getting older
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, you know, if they saw us
growing things, it'd be like, these aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: pure sativas, you need like proper
sativas, and they'd rave about Thai and
[SPEAKER_00]: Indonesian and Papua New Guinean sativas
and stuff, you know, so always my
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective anywhere was that so for me,
it was just that was the natural thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: be interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started trying to grow for
myself, I sort of had this realization,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hell, I know where all these
places are, I want these seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can see online that all these other
people are wanting these seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where to go to go and get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just a kind of natural
progression, really, it just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all kind of fell into place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes connections like to track down
like legitimate stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you seem to be quite a well read
historian of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I can't imagine the links that
you've had to go to, to even bring out a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of this old stuff and a lot of the the
land race stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's sort of partly become
possible because of spending enough time
[SPEAKER_00]: in these places that you get to know
people and they trust you enough,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really varies, though, because some
some bits of some bits of the of Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, it's not really that you need
particularly to have connections,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just need to know where the places
are, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you can, you can go to this
as long as you know where the places are
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of in a lot of the more central
Asian parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually quite a lot easier because
it's really the tropics where it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: tricky because there's no reason to have
seeds in the tropics, other than to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: sinsemila, you know, it's not like their
food or something like in Nepal,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the land race types anyway,
as much as anything are cultivated for the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you know, there are some areas
where and the same actually is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: true in even in the Hindu Kush,
you know, is the seeds are a winter food
[SPEAKER_00]: source as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really overlooked thing,
actually, like even amongst the experts,
[SPEAKER_00]: people seem to realize that cannabis is a
multipurpose crop in all of the northern
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, like including Afghanistan and the
Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only bit where it's not a multipurpose
crop is in the tropical areas where where
[SPEAKER_00]: is ganja, which is sinsemila, semisensi,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only where it's a single
purpose crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only grown for producing the buds,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that makes sense, too,
with the hash, with the hash production
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff, because they can still collect
the hash and harvest the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sometimes it like I've read
people like David Watson, Sam Skunkman
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, you know, we tried really hard to
persuade the Afghans to like grow the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: as sinsemila and like they just actually
just want interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a pretty good reason for that,
which is actually the seeds are a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important winter food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very high in, you know,
important fats and proteins as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then particularly in the mountains,
that's really necessary, because
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, you can't keep like huge herds
of animals very easily in the mountains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have a few cows and goats and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not like there's a there's a
there's a huge demand for land and water
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything in any mountain area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if you can have that
extra source of protein and fats,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's pretty essential, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like some of the Middle Eastern
places would be super hard to make those
[SPEAKER_02]: connections, especially nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember hearing even Neville's story
back with I think Clive, I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what he goes by when they went to I think
it was Afghanistan and one of them Odeid
[SPEAKER_02]: in a hut and they were, you know,
trying to kick in their door and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that's how the story went
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can only imagine how crazy it is to
try to get inroads in there nowadays with
[SPEAKER_02]: the political climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one thing one thing I pick up on
first is just in terms of thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the geography of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan, I think if you if you want to
have a kind of clear or just because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's really helpful, you know,
with everything is like context is
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for cannabis, it's really good to get
the geographical and cultural context kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of on a basic kind of map in your mind,
as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say Afghanistan is best
thought of as like southern Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Central Asia rather than the Middle
East is how I would talk about it in this
[SPEAKER_00]: terms, because it's that's the really
essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in what we call Indica's in this
loose sense, colloquial sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: are a Central Asian domestic basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Afghanistan is really sort of the
southern edge of Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than the Middle East,
I think if you is it Middle East is
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly more sort of confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a confusing term.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, it connects Afghanistan
really sort of connects in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sense with Xinjiang and places like that,
which is eastern Central Asia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bukhara is sort of really, you know,
central Central Asia, as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are all historically very
connected, important cannabis senses in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the sort of Indica type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Races.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, going to those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's been it's been
increasingly difficult, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Taliban being allowed to kind of
retake the entire place and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and, you know, there is also,
yeah, the fact that other definitely one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I found going to those bits of the
world is that the culture of kind of opium
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff does mix with the cannabis
culture quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely met characters who were
having problems with things like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, harder substances like heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's there's there's various ways
to do these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the people who were
helping us for a while with stringers for
[SPEAKER_00]: media and journalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, all of the people I know who are
from these places who were working as
[SPEAKER_00]: stringers and which means sort of helping
[SPEAKER_00]: journalists and media companies who want
to make productions in those areas to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the people, find the right places doing
that kind of job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would just have a sideline
in helping collect seeds for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously, once the once the
Biden sort of pulled the plug on air
[SPEAKER_00]: support for and tech support and
everything for the Afghan army,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just got overrun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them had to then spend the
next sort of, you know, half a year in
[SPEAKER_00]: like safe houses, trying not to get
executed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a different perspective on
these things, because everyone is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I mean, I was like, you know,
detour too far into politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought the whole that whole post
911 adventure was just completely
[SPEAKER_00]: misguided.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, once they've actually
committed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then just suddenly fucking turn around
and say, actually, you know what,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck that, we're just going to leave and
not even tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, was just just an astonishing fucking
betrayal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone was expecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's American and that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no sort of just seems to be capable
of finding a kind of sensible middle
[SPEAKER_00]: ground on foreign policy interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, always going one way or the other
too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we're all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we want nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to fucking affect all the
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaving all the caches of weapons and
whatnot to just to find their their homes
[SPEAKER_00]: to wherever they can do something crane
the way it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's just give them the entire
fucking anyway, but yeah, it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, so yeah, I mean, that's that's
mostly what I've seen of it is the the
[SPEAKER_00]: post 911 kind of version of the hippie
trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is quite hard to avoid the political
aspects of it, because absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: transformed by the time I got to see most
of it, like it, you know, the context in
[SPEAKER_00]: which I saw people smoking a lot were like
security guards and so you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of those kind of characters like
sitting around like with like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, guns and stuff outside places
like embassies and hotels and whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, very publicly smoking hash and
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this sort of there's a whole
martial kind of militant, not militant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, warfare type context of kind of
cannabis use there and things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: started to whereas yeah, it's not just a
sort of the hippie trail, stereotypes of
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of spiritual use and things are
actually just one side of the culture of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's whole ranges of ways it's used
traditionally that aren't necessarily part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the main Western discourse of like
oriental cannabis culture, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's part of the story that
fascinates me because it's a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that even as deep into cannabis
history and stuff as I am, that's like not
[SPEAKER_02]: something I'm really super familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't speak on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're the type of person that I can
speak to that has a lot more insight into
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the more people are able to
see all these different perspectives,
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways of thinking about how it's
been used, maybe ways they've never even
[SPEAKER_02]: considered, you know, I think that's
really important to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's like, I think everyone,
you know, we all kind of want to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the roots of the plant are and
where it's come from and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's definitely been a tendency in
sort of the right on in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: writing about it to favor this idea that
it's to favor aspects of it that fitted
[SPEAKER_00]: with the sort of historical moment of the
60s when it really became a mass
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon in the West, you know,
which was mostly sort of the anti-war,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-racist and sort of countercultural
aspects that were emphasized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although things like, you know,
the assassins and stuff did kind of creep
[SPEAKER_00]: in there because that was already talked
about quite a lot in sort of orientalist
[SPEAKER_00]: myths of legends or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that and that does go into
the martial context of use and stuff as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I thought we should go over
early on too, because I mean, the
[SPEAKER_02]: nomenclature is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even this far in, like, I don't feel
confident anymore, like trying to say what
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a land race is versus an heirloom
versus, you know, anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to have your actual working
definitions of some of these things as we
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people understand what we're talking
about when we say land race and heirloom
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a fucking minefield of like
different terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, land race is just a really
unfortunate word from my perspective that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a translation that was made in the
sort of late 19th century from various
[SPEAKER_00]: European languages into English from
German terms, Danish terms, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in German it would be Landtrasse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was translated in English as land
race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas actually, if you were to do that
translation, these days, land race would
[SPEAKER_00]: be best translated as country breed or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a defunct form of the word race
that we just don't use anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely archaic now in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Race did once in English have the meaning
of breed, as in that created something
[SPEAKER_00]: that someone has bred has created like a
crop or a breed of animal, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So land races are artificially selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're creations by humans for products
that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're created in certain areas by
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have an element of region being
region specific and cultures, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: culture specific and they're absolutely
creatures of human desire and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're things that farmers have
created for certain products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all land races are products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tropical land races are specific
for it was walking drug quote,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, air quotes, drug cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tropical land races from places like
India, Southeast Asia are all specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for since Emila slash semi sensei,
as in ganja is the traditional term for
[SPEAKER_00]: this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the seedless inflorescences or,
you know, very lightly seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that product goes back to at
least the 15th century, perhaps as early
[SPEAKER_00]: as the 12th century in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find Sanskrit literature that
describes that technique of roging out the
[SPEAKER_00]: males, cutting down the males,
how to maximize resin production by
[SPEAKER_00]: certain cultivation techniques and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we call sativas are, you know,
those are what we call sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tropical land race is narrowly
flitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: High THC because they've got this long
history of individual plant selection
[SPEAKER_00]: that's enabled by keeping the seed from a
batch of good ganja, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in practice, farmers don't,
you can find genuinely 100% since Emila.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still around even these days in
places like India and Thailand and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, if you buy a batch
of any significant size of ganja,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will find one or two seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in India, you know, it can be
loads of seeds often, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it shouldn't be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically, it wasn't like that for
the most part, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing, but it goes back that far.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that, that it went back to
the 12th century with selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with cutting down them, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so the point is that
individual plant selection is a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: selective pressure and that is enabled by,
that strong selective pressure is enabled
[SPEAKER_00]: by the fact that you do often find a seed
or two in a batch of ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganja that you would buy, you know.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consumers and aficionados and farmers
are all able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consciously or unconsciously,
you've got at least 500 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: individual plant selection being a factor
in the creation of sativas, which is why,
[SPEAKER_00]: as any kind of aficionado knows,
they are the strongest forms of land
[SPEAKER_00]: races, Thai, Lao, Burmese, South Indian,
like Kerala.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these types of plants are what went in
to form the real kind of original haze
[SPEAKER_00]: type sativas that people know in the
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, back in the late 60s,
early 70s, this was literally fetching
[SPEAKER_00]: multiples its weight in gold in terms of
price by the time it got from Thailand to
[SPEAKER_00]: the West coast of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the same in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the custom seizures
records from the early 70s for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that was coming from places like Isan in
Thailand, it was like, they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was testing, you know, with thin layer
chromatography, but which is not hugely
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate, but it was testing kind of 17%
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not gaming the tests and it's
probably sat in a warehouse in London for
[SPEAKER_00]: months, nevermind how long it took to get
to England in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, we're talking high levels
of potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people aren't making it up when they
say that this stuff could blow your head
[SPEAKER_00]: off, you know, even in the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need much more than 10% THC
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's about the other stuff that's
in these, the other phytochemicals that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, to stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the North, the main group is
what people call colloquially the Indicas,
[SPEAKER_00]: which the, you know, I guess everyone
knows what I'm talking about broadly
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, but again, this is a type of
land race that, you know, with the more
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-dwarf morphology used for making
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So product specific, there's no culture of
Sinsamila in North of 30 degrees latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got to the North of
Pakistan, there just is no, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you've even got to the Punjab in
India or the Punjab in Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bisected by colonialism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got there, there's no culture
of Sinsamila by the time you even get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Punjab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've gone North of the Punjab
towards the foothills of the Hindu Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely no Sinsamila culture at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all hash and it's always been that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make hash, you pull the seeds
in the process of making the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not ever been much in the way
of any individual plant selection on hash
[SPEAKER_00]: land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a bulk selected crop that
probably goes back millennia, perhaps,
[SPEAKER_00]: that bulk selection, which is why on
balance the cannabinoid characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicas land races do lean slightly
towards THC dominant plants, like type one
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, as people will call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have in the population a mix of
type one, type two, type three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, high ratio THC to CBD is
type one, balanced THC and CBD is type
[SPEAKER_00]: two, and then type three is sort of higher
ratio of CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most hash land races will typically,
if they're a pure land race, we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: not a not Afghani number one or something
you can buy off a Dutch seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're a real land race, they tend to
be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do lean slightly towards type one
because they've had that history of bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than random lean towards type
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you want to grow a crop of
Sinsamila from seed, it's not much use to
[SPEAKER_00]: use a real land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be worked to make them a
Sinsamila cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were talking about the
difference between an heirloom and a land
[SPEAKER_00]: race, heirloom is not a technical term as
far as I know, but I would define it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the context of cannabis as a land race
that's been worked specifically in a
[SPEAKER_00]: Western or modern context for Sinsamila.
[SPEAKER_00]: So X18 or deep chunk or Afghani number
one, they're all Indica heirlooms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense they're an Indica land race that's
been worked for making Sinsamila.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I would define it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got one other group.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you define those in terms of
land race heirloom?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it its own type?
[SPEAKER_00]: So feral or wild type is another term you
could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's quite good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't find them much in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a rule, cannabis doesn't naturalize
very well in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a species that is well adapted to
that type of climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do find feral cannabis in the
tropics, it's because you're at altitude
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere with a fairly temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the most part, if you're in,
for example, India, you might find weedy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing anywhere north of the
Ganges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking in the top half of North
India between the Ganges and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you go up towards the
Himalayas, suddenly you'll find areas
[SPEAKER_00]: where it just grows fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just seas of feral stuff, especially if
you go up into Pakistan, like Punjab,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then up into the mountains around the
rivers and places, anywhere where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of disturbed land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically as a species,
it's a step species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning it likes kind of windy,
fairly dry places where there's lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbed land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it likes to grow along the sides of
rivers where animals come to drink and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes high nitrogen, decent amounts of
water, but not rainy, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it turn to lean CBD dominant for
stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically they're kind of, like nobody
knows where there's a pure, nobody's ever
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of satisfactorily identified like a
pure wild, like unaffected by humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: pure wild cannabis plants has never been
found, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you actually have is like parallel
populations that have just been swapping
[SPEAKER_00]: genes with whatever the local form of
cannabis is, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense of like humans domesticated at
least I don't know, kind of say 8,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, probably we started at least,
you know, unintentionally domesticating
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by just bringing it back to hunter
gatherers, like bringing it back to places
[SPEAKER_00]: where they were eating and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, we're unconsciously selecting
for types that we liked, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then quite happy to grow around our
campfires and stuff because there was lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of shit and discarded animal bones and
stuff that just are good for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically if you're in somewhere like
the Punjab where it grows, which is north
[SPEAKER_00]: west India, where there's a lot of
wild-grown cannabis, you can, people do
[SPEAKER_00]: like crop the feral weedy stuff,
provided it's somewhere clean that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: dusty and things, you can just crop that
and use it for making food and things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are high THC in the sense of they
will get you stoned, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like in places like, I don't
know, Wisconsin or somewhere in the States
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's basically hemp that's gone
feral, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the fiber hemp raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these are definitely like,
if we're talking go pro to make things
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing, but anyway, these are like in
those, in all of sort of central and South
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia where you get feral populations,
it's pretty much drug type quotes,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the Himalayas, like people do
sometimes hand rub the feral populations
[SPEAKER_00]: for charis and it makes people sometimes
called jungly charis as in like wild
[SPEAKER_00]: charis, but actually there's a again,
this is one of those kind of hippie trail
[SPEAKER_00]: type confusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been this assumption that
Himalayan cannabis is always feral
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, which is it, which it isn't like
99% of the charis that's produced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Himalayas every year is from domesticated,
intentionally cultivated land races grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in fields by a farmer, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assumption that Himalayan cannabis is
all wild and stuff is not accurate,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in terms of the product is just very
seldom produced from the wild weedy
[SPEAKER_00]: stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can and people do, but it's got way
less resin production than the actual land
[SPEAKER_00]: races do, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's useless for making a sinsemilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, because it's all going to be
seeded anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use it to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you do see sadhus doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen sadhus like yogis wandering
kind of yogi characters who've gone to
[SPEAKER_00]: Himalayas and picked a whole load of feral
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just sit and they kind of
pick out the seeds and mix it with some
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not designed for that,
which is why people rub it for charis
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's time consuming to do,
but you end up with a product that is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to get you stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas smoking a whole load of feral bud
like that mixed with tobacco, it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a kind of maybe take the edge
off whatever physical discomfort you
[SPEAKER_00]: experience as a wandering yogi,
but it's not going to get you particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: high, I wouldn't have thought,
unless you've really just happened to find
[SPEAKER_00]: an unusually strong plant.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the interesting things,
like from the American perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least from mine, is trying in my mind
to define expressions between,
[SPEAKER_02]: when people talk about indica types
specifically, or the broadleaf types,
[SPEAKER_02]: the differences between an Afghani type
plant and a Pakistani plant, where the
[SPEAKER_02]: overlap is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's always talk of Chinese
broadleaf types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never got my hands on any of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember someone made the Yunnan
available for a while, but I never got to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow any.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to hear some of your insight on
that and the major differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's kind of hard to generally
speak on expressions from whole regions,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, depending on the elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there anything that you've noticed
between, say, Afghanistan and Pakistan in
[SPEAKER_02]: how they grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent expressions, anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's particularly difficult with
those northern type, Central Asian,
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan, Pakistani populations,
because what you get if you grow like a
[SPEAKER_00]: first generation of direct from those
places, like seeds directly from a farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: in Pakistan or Afghanistan, whatever,
there's a huge amount of variation within
[SPEAKER_00]: the population of one batch of seeds from
one farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the range of aromas you're going to
find in one field from plant to plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: just in one of those land races,
it's extraordinarily diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one plant may be really kind of
like kind of candy shop, sweet,
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one might smell like a dog shit,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's particularly in those northern
populations, because they're bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: selected, they're not as genetically
narrow as tropical sativa populations are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because they haven't had they haven't,
you know, the the genome hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: stepped on by farmers doing much in the
way of very consciously intentionally
[SPEAKER_00]: directed breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge amount of variation anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, in terms of the
difficulty of generalizing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the assumption amongst aficionados
is that precision, more precision in in
[SPEAKER_00]: your description means more accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, if you get if you get too
precise on these things, you become less
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's vast amounts of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly with cannabis,
because it's so phenotypically plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because like I was saying, it's a
mountain species that's evolved at
[SPEAKER_00]: altitude to adapt to the huge climate
shifts you get at altitude and that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can express itself very differently
depending on where it's planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to plant the same land race
at sea level and then plant it at three
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half thousand meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly the same batch of seeds from the
same farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see very different plant looking
plants morphologically, because you plant
[SPEAKER_00]: them up higher altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow much shorter,
broader, more broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pump out way more resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably going to have different
phytochemicals that probably smell
[SPEAKER_00]: different and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise, if you you can get that even
with tropical sativas, if you grow them on
[SPEAKER_00]: well, they're going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow them incompetently,
they're not going to smell so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you kind of have to go to point of
origin to experience them as they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it definitely makes a vast
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with the more genetically narrow
populations like tropical sativas,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're grown well by someone who knows
how to do it on the right type of land
[SPEAKER_00]: with the right irrigation timing,
the right feeding timing, the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overwater a tropical sativa late in
the flower, it's going to keep growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep putting out buds and leaflets,
and it's going to be shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why you get all this bollocks
talk about 30 weeks of sativas indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people just keep on fucking
watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you know, and if you look at
the historical records, it's always,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will tell you this, like in the 19th
century documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ganja farms in Bengal and places,
it's like, yeah, farmers always say the
[SPEAKER_00]: worst thing that can happen is we get
rains in like January, February,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll fuck up our whole crop because
it will start shooting again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all it's all there if you want to
look and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have blogged about this on the on
the site as well, if people are wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: go into more depth and you can find all
the sources and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an amazing blog, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's I've learned a lot reading
through it over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's how I how I like came to
know you without speaking to you a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: was through the blog and seeing the
passion and how you write and how in depth
[SPEAKER_02]: the detail was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, learning how accurate it
was, which is the most important,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shifted most of it now to the actual
main website blog rather than the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: independent blog, because it just seems to
make more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, I've been kind of moving
everything over to the main blog on the
[SPEAKER_00]: site now, just because it seems to make
more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I before I lose the thread of what you
were originally asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of Pakistan versus
Afghanistan, so the thing to bear in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, seeds move around a lot of seeds
move around with people in areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: people use them as as a food and not just
for growing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these are artificial political
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no cultural real boundary in
meaningful terms, cannabis wise,
[SPEAKER_00]: between the Hindu Kush in Pakistan and the
Hindu Kush in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to try to kind of avoid being
sort of bitchy as far as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's all this stuff I see on
Instagram of people talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Durrind line and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the Durrind line, it's just it's
just fucking bizarre to me as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think most of the kids who are
doing this are like Asian as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the Durrind line was just
Durrind was just some cunt from the UK who
[SPEAKER_00]: drew a pencil line across the boundary
between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the fuck does that have to do
with anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's only in the last kind of 10
years that they've actually really started
[SPEAKER_00]: policing that border and putting fences up
and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, it doesn't make the
blindest fucking bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who really wants to get across it
can still do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cannabis terms, it's just fucking
meaningless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and seeds have been, you know,
seeds have been moved from Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_00]: down to places like Tiravalli in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's plenty of local stories
about the various kind of dervish like
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalanda Sufi type saint characters who are
sort of credited with bringing seeds into
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiravalli and things and which is one of
the big cultivation values in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this this whole area is
seamless, seamless with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole reason the politics and the
history is the way it is, is because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is impossible to police these mountain
borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm sure there's huge smuggling
between these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Chitral is another one of the
famous areas like Yakun Valley and things
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: These all lead into Xinjiang.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the trade routes that you would
take from Xinjiang, which is the eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: central Asian area, this Turkic area of
politically it's inside what's now China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the biggest hash producing
region in the world for a while for
[SPEAKER_00]: centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this was the epicenter of hash
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't Afghanistan or Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Xinjiang was until the 19 late
1930s was the absolute fucking epicenter
[SPEAKER_00]: of world hash production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, thousands and thousands of tons of
hash were being moved from these places
[SPEAKER_00]: across the mountain passes into India,
because all the money was in northern
[SPEAKER_00]: India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the demand for these products was in
northern India and these huge cities,
[SPEAKER_00]: which even in the late 19th century places
like Lahore and Delhi had millions of what
[SPEAKER_00]: Lahore certainly had in just a big Punjabi
city had, you know, seven, eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine, 10 million people or whatever even
in the 1860s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were massively massive centers of
demand for these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the production was all happening in
eastern central Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Xinjiang and, you know, the British
were trying to make sure as much of what
[SPEAKER_00]: came into India was being taxed
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want too much smuggling and,
you know, seeds were moving around between
[SPEAKER_00]: these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read about the people who were
responsible for a lot of the initiation of
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production in Xinjiang for
India were often Indians or from ethnic
[SPEAKER_00]: groups of the mountains of Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just not much basis for
assuming that there's going to be a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a very nuanced picture
if you're talking about the different how
[SPEAKER_00]: these land races in these regions are
differentiated from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, once you get into Pakistan in the
northern mountains, there probably is a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain degree of mixing between kind of
the more sativa type.
[SPEAKER_00]: The further south you move away from the
southern edges of Central Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: the further south you get away from the
Hindu push.
[SPEAKER_00]: There probably is more, there is a higher
likelihood that you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of intermixing with more monsoon-y
type, tropical type, Punjabi type
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, more hybridization between
sativa type populations and indica type
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The further north you go into,
I don't know, into places like Xinjiang,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a higher likelihood, I guess,
of it being a sort of, quote, pure indica
[SPEAKER_00]: type, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the plants that were
brought back from Xinjiang in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 20th century by people like Frank Meyer
and stuff for the USDA, they definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: are very indica-looking plants and yeah,
I mean, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some of those pictures on your
blog too, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's no question that
there are these distinct types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the confusion with the
discussion about are there such things as
[SPEAKER_00]: indicas and sativas is like, yes,
there definitely are in terms of if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at pure land races, real land
races, there are these clearly distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also, of course, some integrating
between them, even in pure land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some land races are likely to have arisen
through mixing of these types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, once you move into the
context of what you're going to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: most dispensaries or seed banks,
like cannabis internet seed banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is, yeah, most of what you're going
to find is an indica-to-sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this terminology becomes meaningless
often most of the time in those contexts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an important point too,
especially from people in the US that can
[SPEAKER_02]: go to collectives and stuff and they're
seeing indica, hybrid, sativa,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they feel like they have a pretty good
working knowledge of what each is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And quite often, I mean, I don't really
see anything too narrowly anywhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or not at all.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem because that's how cannabis
goes extinct, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodiversity in cannabis primarily
disappears through hybridization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this impulse that most people have to
like hybridize everything when they,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is fun, you know, so I see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the most exciting thing you can
do really these days, especially is to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually keep some pristine lines going
that you haven't out-crossed, because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the basis of everything really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we've got to a point where all
we've got are hybridized lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it becomes impossible to do breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't have to become
impossible, but you can't make true F1
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars and stuff.
Absolutely.
