[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-dog, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode, we will be joined by
Chimera, longtime member of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: community and a well-respected member of
the breeding community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Known for his skills in the areas of
neuroscience, plant breeding and
[SPEAKER_03]: biotechnology, this conversation starts
already in progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: The important thing is that we go through
a lab report and show people what are the
[SPEAKER_04]: things to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you, like, obviously in lab
reports, there's all this built-in
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you take that information and
essentially infer things about the results
[SPEAKER_04]: or see if you can identify problems with
what the lab has done?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, what you sent me the
other day, and I think you got those
[SPEAKER_04]: posted on your IG or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're posted on the IG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people can check those out either now
or later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like I said, one of the
things I said to you back then was that it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't really a lab report, but it was a
spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that was, those were results that
somebody had cut and pasted into a
[SPEAKER_04]: spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's an opportunity for, like,
anybody to manipulate the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody could fuck with it at that point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In an Excel spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lab report is essentially like a legal
document in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are a legal document.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they are legal documents?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when it comes to, like,
you know, obviously there's all this
[SPEAKER_04]: environmental testing that needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the context of regulations,
Like these are legal documents that
[SPEAKER_04]: certify something for the purpose of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that happens to be done to a good
standard, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I'm not having the money
luck sending this thing over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that'll bring up a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might want to actually go in and
copy the link from the picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this lab report is called the
Phytofax.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Phytofax was developed by Napro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually, it's an image search.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what comes up for you,
but it's the top left picture on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, one sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to switch off here because it'll
pause me for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You looked really crazy when you were
frozen, like you had this really bizarre
[SPEAKER_03]: look to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it'll even let me show
pictures on here now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might just have to copy and paste the
link in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you know what, we'll put it up on our
IG after so people can see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's put it up on the IG after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so essentially, like look,
when most places give you back a lab
[SPEAKER_04]: report, I mean, we're looking at,
even if we're just talking cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're looking at like minimum 12
chemicals, OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like, I guess it's probably
important to talk like a little bit about
[SPEAKER_04]: lab testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's various ways, there's different
assays that you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's different tests that you can
run to try and determine the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: content of a sample, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put it into a GC, a GC has got
something called, what is it called,
[SPEAKER_04]: the injection port on a GC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like putting, what you do is you
take, think about you, like you got your
[SPEAKER_04]: bud, you put it in some alcohol or some
methanol or something that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: extract the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're more or less shaking it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you take like one microliter of
the liquid that has now dissolved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got your ethanol, but now you've
got all the stuff that came off the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, in that liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we want to do is we take,
we take a small sample of that liquid,
[SPEAKER_04]: call it like a thousandth of a milliliter,
and that gets injected into this injection
[SPEAKER_04]: port of the gas chromatic, OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what that does is it takes the
liquid that we have with all of our stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: inside it and it makes it into a vapor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That injection port is heated like 300
degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are 350 degrees Celsius or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the point is, is when you put that shit
in, in the liquid, sorry, that liquid into
[SPEAKER_04]: the injector and it becomes a vapor,
it automatically decarboxylates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't, you no longer have,
because the cannabis plant doesn't make
[SPEAKER_04]: THC, it makes THC acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really want to be able to detect the
compounds as they were in, in the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what happens is when stuff gets
decarboxylated, a certain percentage of it
[SPEAKER_04]: like gets destroyed in the conversion
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, if you start with like a
hundred percent of THC acid or a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: molecules of THC acid and say you lose 20%
of those molecules as it gets converted
[SPEAKER_04]: into THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get a report at the end that
shows 80 milligrams of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: THC or 80 units of THC, that's not what
was actually in the sample, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Our testing method has destroyed part of
the sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you go back and look at like all
the cannabinoid testing that's been done,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in the scientific literature,
60s, 70s, 80s, most of it was done on DC,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the numbers that we see are going to be
lower than really what was in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so call it like- That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like roughly after 2000 sometime,
it might've been like late nineties,
[SPEAKER_04]: people started realizing, hey,
no, we need to do this in what's called an
[SPEAKER_04]: HPLC or a high pressure liquid
chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the liquid chromatograph doesn't do
that initial decarboxylation step,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because your sample, it gets, rather than
going into an injection port, your
[SPEAKER_04]: microliter of liquid sample that we use to
extract, you know, our extraction buffer
[SPEAKER_04]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That gets injected into like a stream of
other liquid that runs through the machine
[SPEAKER_04]: at like 25, 27, 30 degrees, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's not decarboxylating anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the chemicals that are in that,
in the HPLC and the liquid chromatograph,
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't change, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're getting if we use that
method is an accurate representation of
[SPEAKER_04]: what's in the sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's a much better technique for
using for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what they use now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all labs are the same, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of the way, here's the
thing is the regulations usually say you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to develop a test that will
accurately quantify cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that test must be what's called
validated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And validated just means like you run a
set of experiments using your protocol to
[SPEAKER_04]: show that your protocol is actually
measuring what you say it's measuring,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's like calibrating your
ruler.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like proving that your ruler is
calibrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're not saying stuff 12 inches and
really it's like, you know, eight and a
[SPEAKER_04]: half inches or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Validation is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the regulations say you have to
develop a validated method, but they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: tell you, you have to use this exact
method with this machine and this column
[SPEAKER_04]: and this solvent and this extraction
buffer, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what ends up happening is every lab
develops and you'll see if you go and ask
[SPEAKER_04]: them about their methods, a lot of them
will come back and say, well, that's
[SPEAKER_04]: proprietary.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't disclose to you the way we do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sort of a red flag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I'm in labs, you know,
like I'm not a one-off, like we do it in
[SPEAKER_04]: house because it gets too expensive,
but to do it as a third party.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I am working with a third party
lab, we're not just running one or two
[SPEAKER_04]: tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're going to be running hundreds of
tests, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're essentially paying them to
generate data for us, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I need to be sure that the test that
you guys are running actually measures
[SPEAKER_04]: what it says.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll go in to a lab and say,
show me all your validation documents.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't let you photocopy them,
take them with you, but you can certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: sit down in their office and read through
their methods.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've done this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I was working at Napro,
we did this with multiple different labs
[SPEAKER_04]: because Napro was a research lab and we
had dispensary clients that were so,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, growers that we represented
would grow the samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would analyze the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd go off to the lab or they go off
the dispensary, but the dispensary would
[SPEAKER_04]: be using like one or two or three of the
biggest labs in California for the same
[SPEAKER_04]: samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had our data that we knew was damn
solid and we've published the methods so
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody can go and check out why it's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like we had real confidence in
that our results were right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we would, what would happen is because
our client would send off the same sample
[SPEAKER_04]: that we had data for to multiple labs,
we would get back that are essentially
[SPEAKER_04]: duplicate copies of the same results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with somebody else's lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was generated by something else and
you'd see, oh, this lab can identify
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenaline or this lab is confusing CBD
and CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like those are pretty big deals,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, again, like 99.9% of the samples
they see are THC only.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't really matter whether that
tiny little blip is CBD or CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, like if we're saying that this
is a legal document that supports the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations that have been created to
protect cannabis, like it's kind of an
[SPEAKER_04]: important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you'd think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the gas chromatography,
when they do that kind of sample with the
[SPEAKER_03]: ethanol is that little tiny one milliliter
that they are point, whatever milliliters,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that homogeneous enough when they pull
it to be a great average of the sample
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're taking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that, is it, is that how that works?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, that's a very good
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the sampling of the one microliter out
of this thing, like you can, you can
[SPEAKER_04]: imagine that like every step along that
process from taking the flower,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's actually goes back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it starts with the sampling
procedure.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get the bud out of the bag
that it was grown in or out of the lot
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was grown in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so very often what happens,
this is like, listen, everybody's found
[SPEAKER_04]: all sorts of ways to game the system
because the consumer is so THC driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody is trying to work every single
sample angle, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, growers will go and cherry
pick all the biggest, nicest, beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: buds out of the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest buds are in the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get directly, they're going to have a
lot of chemical content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you want a real number of the
batch, we developed a sampling method
[SPEAKER_04]: where, you know, you take one bud this big
and one bud this big, and then one bud
[SPEAKER_04]: this big, and they all get combined
together or, you know, so many grams of
[SPEAKER_04]: each, the whole thing gets blended up and
homogenized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you use that homogenized sample
to do your extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're showing up at SC labs and
you're trying to like, you've got a feed
[SPEAKER_04]: company, you're trying to sell a million
seeds, they go and they chop off the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: This nice big buds, they trim all the like
the green leafy parts off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's absolutely nothing but resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then those pristine, beautiful baby
labs go off.
[SPEAKER_04]: The samples go off to the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get a fucking higher
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's obvious, but these are the games
that end up getting played because the
[SPEAKER_04]: more THC you got in your sample,
the better the distributors and the
[SPEAKER_04]: retailers and everybody is, you know,
anybody that's THC focused, they're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to get bamboo from that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like you said, that's just sampling
the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it goes to the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like maybe the labs like getting paid a
decent fee and they like put like an
[SPEAKER_04]: extra, you know, 0.5 or 5% extra flower on
the scale when they go to do the
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction buffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's a million ways between the
plant and getting, you know, that
[SPEAKER_04]: injection going into the injection port,
ways to manipulate the sample.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget like intentionally manipulating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also like natural variation and
like experimental error that happens that
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to allow, that is going to have
unallowed variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one thing we were talking about the
other day is that like, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada, the regulation says that the
THC content in the flower must be
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever's labeled on the, on the bag or
the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it's labeled for THC content that
has to be within plus or minus 15%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the actual amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so that's like, if it's 20% and it's
actual 20%, 50% of 20 is three.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means that like 23 to 17 or 17 to
23 is actually like that plus or minus 15%
[SPEAKER_04]: window on either side of 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like it's important for people to
understand that like, with a loud error
[SPEAKER_04]: that's to be expected, there's really no
difference between 17% and 23%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and again, that would apply like
between 30 and 24, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, well, yeah, as you go up,
like, yeah, 30 now, you know, but 50% of
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 is four and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got like 34% down to like,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: 26, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, that's a huge, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you get higher, it gets wider.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And listen, that is cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabinoids are typically regulated by
regulation, like the regulator,
[SPEAKER_04]: whoever makes the rules for the,
you know, to set up a legal program says,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, cannabinoid lab tests have to be with
plus or minus within plus or minus 15%.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what, that's going to be our
allowed range.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your, your assay that are that protocol
that your lab designs to generate this
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, it has to hit between these two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like for example, turbs aren't
regulated in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're not cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a specific class that bind to the
cannabinoid receptor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's arguably like only beta carry off
when it binds to one of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but they're, they're a different
chemical class, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: all of us, all the producers and
retailers, they want that terpene info on
[SPEAKER_04]: the label, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is somewhat informative to the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's another way that you can
differentiate your product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say, Hey, mine's different because this is
the chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, terpenoids or terpenes aren't
regulated in the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there is no requirement to analyze
and disclose the amount of terpene content
[SPEAKER_04]: on a flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's purely an extra thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So because they're not regulated
molecules, there's no fucking regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: that says, Hey, it has to be within 15%
allowable range limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Canada, and I'm sure it's,
I don't, I don't know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably varies by district in the
state, but at least in Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're not regulated labs set
their own allowable acceptable range.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I validated one labs method and I was
reading through their described allowable
[SPEAKER_04]: range is 30% plus or minus.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got like, let's call it like,
well, let's call it 6% terps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A third is like two at of those six.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's essentially saying like,
you know, two percent on either side of
[SPEAKER_04]: six, that's like from four to 8% range
that the lab can't really differentiate
[SPEAKER_04]: between the difference between those two
things.
Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's a, that's a huge bummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think people understand that
because, you know, when some of these labs
[SPEAKER_04]: publish the results, they're like,
Oh, you have like 3.479 milligrams of or
[SPEAKER_04]: 3.579% Mircea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's like, dude, if it's 30% off,
why the hell are we measuring it down to
[SPEAKER_04]: three decimals?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you just, it's so dumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, you have to realize there's a
difference between accurately labeling,
[SPEAKER_04]: labeling the information on a product
versus how can you stick information on a
[SPEAKER_04]: label of a product?
[SPEAKER_04]: To sway a consumer's buying preference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And clearly those aren't the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of, I think it's really,
well, for anybody watching, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're just basing things on THC
numbers, you're getting fooled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're getting bamboozled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting, you're having your
marketing emotions played with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, this is what companies do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So understanding that all
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for, in the, in the numbers that
you sent me, one of the things I found
[SPEAKER_04]: really interesting was, you know,
whenever I look at a lab report,
[SPEAKER_04]: my first thing is, I don't even like
everybody goes to straight to TAC or
[SPEAKER_04]: straight to terpene content or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, who, who's the lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the lab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these guys trustworthy or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can have like a thousand lab
reports or 2000 lab reports.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start to say, Hey, these guys always
have like, you know, like all of their
[SPEAKER_04]: overalls are like 33 to 38% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apply that same logic to seed companies,
you know, like I see them working with
[SPEAKER_03]: things like 40 different things that have
been non-existent for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, okay, well, full of shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is too, like the other thing
you got to keep in mind too, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: when we see these huge THC scores,
like 30 plus percent THC acid,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a huge amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really is like a fucking massive
amount for a plant to produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one flower on one run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what was set and sampled.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you follow that cultivar back through
five, 10 cycles, like you'll see 28,
[SPEAKER_04]: 26.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that always appears on the seed
bank package says it's 34%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like people got to realize that like,
when you're being fed one of these
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers, especially if it does not come on
that certified letterhead legal document,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're signed at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if you go down and look at it,
it's signed by the laboratory manager,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause again, that's part of this chain of
custody thing that happens with regulated
[SPEAKER_02]: shit, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check out the lab.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, look before even looking at the
numbers, like I was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I always want to say before I can put any
confidence in these numbers, I need to try
[SPEAKER_04]: and figure out how those numbers were
generated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lab report should say
cannabinoids were, were analyzed by HPLC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I get a laboratory back and it
says cannabinoids were analyzed by GC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, well the cannabinoid
numbers could be off by 30%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we've done those experiments and
you can burn up to 30 or 30% of the total
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid content in an injection port
of the GC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inject, like GCs are not a great
instrument for measuring cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though all the analysis was done that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for terpenes, for example,
it's actually a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of very good labs,
what they'll do is they'll do and you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: do your, you know, you put your bud,
grind it up, homogenize it, take your
[SPEAKER_04]: sample, put in your ethanol or methanol or
whatever your extraction buffer is,
[SPEAKER_04]: strip out the contents, separate out the
solid material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you've got your little liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all your goodies in it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That often gets split into two different
samples or you will sample two different
[SPEAKER_04]: one microliter amounts from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One goes and gets injected into an HPLC
for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: A separate one goes into an HPLC or sorry,
a GC for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually used to do two different
things when we sent the one off to the
[SPEAKER_04]: HPLC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would take your sample out and then we
would take one raw sample out of that sub
[SPEAKER_04]: sample and the other would get diluted by
a factor of 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have nine parts, nine microliters
of the solvent mixed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now what you do is you have a diluted
sample and a concentrated sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the concentrated sample is good for
all the very small components that exist,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, CBC,
[SPEAKER_04]: CBG, whatever the little blip cannabinoids
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially you've got one that's like
really, it's like being able to do it on
[SPEAKER_04]: those with a magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your diluted sample for the molecules that
are there in abundance, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you try to, often if you try to
cram those like THC, like a type one plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that's full of THC, you cram that through
your HPLC and it just, it overloads the
[SPEAKER_04]: detector.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you wanted to, so as you can see all
these places are opportunity for error.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you do them very, very carefully,
you can actually get incredibly,
[SPEAKER_04]: incredibly accurate results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you're like running a thousand,
2000 samples a week that come into your
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial laboratory in California,
that's like throughput, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like you're, you're essentially
breaking down how many can I do in a day?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if I'm doing that many a day,
maybe I don't have the ability to do it
[SPEAKER_04]: quite as accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these are the decisions that get
made in the labs that no one's thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody just thinks you drop down your
120 bucks or 150 bucks and you get a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of numbers back and it's proof of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just toss it in the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just important for people to
understand the context, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you, did you want to go over the
standard, what the standard is,
[SPEAKER_03]: how it works?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a chemical, so any machine has to be
calibrated, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has the best way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we take, you got your, so you got
your bud, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get your bud, call us our extraction
buffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put a flower in there, you put in your
ethanol and you shake it around,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit at the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit at the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just threw a sample all over the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: You sit at the flower and you got your,
your, your leftover.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've got is ethanol or methanol,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the chemicals that we were able
to strip out of the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_04]: material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got turf, you got all the different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: A standard like, but we don't know how
much of everything is in that sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's an unknown amount of unknown
chemicals in this sample, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we need to do is compare it to a
known sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can actually order pure TNT
from a lab synthesis company and these
[SPEAKER_04]: synthesis companies that are allowed to
have TNT, they're allowed to have,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they get a DEA license so that
like the cops can have, and they'll,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll sell, they'll get a DEA license so
they can synthesize THC and make what are,
[SPEAKER_04]: what are known as like a chemical
standard, which is usually one milligram
[SPEAKER_04]: of THC into one milliliter of methanol.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Methanol is an alcohol, but it's not like
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's poisonous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can make you go blind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea is people won't consume it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so weird that anybody would like
consider the idea to go get THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: See standard ethanol and like fucking
shoot it or whatever they're doing to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is what the DEA is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The context of the DEA is thinking in
programs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're going to try and get high a
milligram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like dude, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like even like a 20% bud is like
200 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, you really, you're going to
try to anyway, of course you don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that's the theory behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one milligram in one milliliter of
ethanol is legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's legal for people can buy and trade it
without having licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you have your one milligram
milliliter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can essentially treat that like your
extraction buffer, extracted cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take like one microliter out of
that milliliter injected into your HPLC
[SPEAKER_04]: and you get a peak of unknown amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can say, okay, this peak is,
I know that it's this known amount we're
[SPEAKER_04]: putting in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, now I can, when I run another
sample and it has a peak of the same size,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it had the equivalent amount
of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a way that you can calibrate your
machines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And good labs will do what are called
check standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you run your calibration curve,
you get the machine all calibrated and
[SPEAKER_04]: then like call it every three or five or
maybe 10 runs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than running a sample, you run your
standard through the standard mix of
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene standards and cannabinoid
standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that should do is that like now
you have throughout your day, you've got
[SPEAKER_04]: your hundred samples that are going
through the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say every 10, you've got like a snapshot
of the machine in calibration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's out, you can see, oh,
hey, we caught it while it was getting out
[SPEAKER_04]: of calibration was recalibrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an important, it's for any analytical
endeavor where you're trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Hey, what's the exact amount of
compound in a plant or in a substrate?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to have the ability to come out
or to, to validate that number,
[SPEAKER_04]: confirm that the amount that you're
measuring is actually what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: measuring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a great question because like when
our, my friend Arno Haskamp is a Dutch
[SPEAKER_04]: research scientist that was involved in
setting up the Dutch system and he's a
[SPEAKER_04]: real plant nerd guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he started doing all this research and
he wanted to check to see if the standards
[SPEAKER_04]: from the chemical company or, or are what
they were, you know, they're supposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: be one milligram per millimeter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he did a whole bunch of tests and
showed that the standard was actually 88
[SPEAKER_04]: or 0.88 milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the, the, the substance that the guys
are selling to all the labs wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: properly calibrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means everybody in the industry is
off.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or everybody from those guys is off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this is, we're talking, you know,
I think this is like 20, 2009,
[SPEAKER_04]: but two years ago in Canada, same thing
happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like somebody had F5 that, Hey,
you know, the ResTech sample that was
[SPEAKER_04]: ResTech as a supplier for standards,
the ResTech samples that everybody uses to
[SPEAKER_04]: calibrate or the half the industry uses to
calibrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been wrong for eight months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, they kept that by it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes up in the circles, but it's like,
yeah, it does come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're, listen, when that happens,
they have to like, they're legally
[SPEAKER_04]: required.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, you're the support industry for
a regulated system.
[SPEAKER_04]: You fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's affecting everybody, how they're
compliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it does, it does become known amongst
labs, but again, it's the type of thing
[SPEAKER_04]: that like the labs, they're not required
to disclose to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably should disclose to their
clients, but often they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it can happen that they don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, like, yeah, that's a chemical
standard and you buy a chemical study.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially you're calibrating for
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, I was just on the SC lab
website reading over through some of their
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They test for 39 terpenes and terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they either have a standard mix that a
chemical supplier supplies, or they buy
[SPEAKER_04]: individually all of those individual
terpenes and create their own standard mix
[SPEAKER_04]: that they use to calibrate the machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not only calibrating for THC,
you're calibrating for terps if you're on
[SPEAKER_04]: the test.
[SPEAKER_03]: For every individual terpene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, now they've gotten to the
point where like, you know, say res tech
[SPEAKER_04]: or someone, one of these terpene,
or these supply chemical supply companies
[SPEAKER_04]: that services the medical cannabis
industry, they might say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've done the mix for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's 15 terpenes, you know, all the
majors or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pioneers terpenoline, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll buy a pre-mixed one of those so
that you don't have to individually go in
[SPEAKER_04]: and create the standard to put it to
calibrate your GC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, anytime you're buying a
compound that you're not making,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're not quantifying yourself is a
potential source of error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's a bit of a deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we started looking at your
results, I started going through them,
[SPEAKER_04]: I realized whoever was generating those
results for one, like, again, it was data
[SPEAKER_04]: pasted into an Excel spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it wasn't even a lab report.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like one like route back like how
much I'm not saying it was the numbers
[SPEAKER_04]: were wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if somebody gave it no, yeah,
my red flags would be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: something could be up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second thing I went through,
and I started looking at what's the ratio
[SPEAKER_04]: of THC in the plant versus THC acid in the
plant, as you probably know, cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't produce THC, it produces the form
THC acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it right, right, right away,
you get a lab report back, and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: junk THC in there, like, I'm talking more
than really a percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably been run through a GC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, okay, if the THC numbers are
coming out, like, you know, 20% THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: 25, whatever, that's, yeah, you should see
25% THC acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you couldn't see 25% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just by that one number, you can see,
oh, they measure the whether or not they
[SPEAKER_04]: measure the cannabinoids through PLC or
through GC.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's three GC, the numbers probably
wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because again, we know that it's a
bunch of it gets destroyed in the
[SPEAKER_04]: injector.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's things that you can like,
right off the top, look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: most people are looking at the they grab
the lab report, they go straight to the
[SPEAKER_04]: THC number, and they're like, 32.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, that's, you shouldn't be
doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at the context of what that
number means.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is all the information in this lab report
consistent?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And internally consistent, like between
each other?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like between itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was one of the things that's
that tweaked me a little bit when I first
[SPEAKER_04]: saw yours, it was like, they had clearly
run an HPLC and GC, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like I said, if you're using it
for the terms, the GC is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were probably looked like they
were collecting that cannabinoid data as
[SPEAKER_04]: they were doing the terpene around as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, you know, in my mind,
like looking at I'm like, ignore that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't even look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't even put any credence into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's just, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and with me, like when I see
something off like that, and like when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to terps and lab reports,
the reason I sent it to you, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: when we talked, I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can read this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, yeah, I, I, I, I'm like anybody
else, you know, like I see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, wow, THC number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Terp numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody asked me about a year ago,
Ryan, when you start getting skeptical
[SPEAKER_04]: about a lab report.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, when somebody says to me,
I have a lab report for you to see.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should already be skeptical of the
results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's not like you're trying to hate
on somebody's report card.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but you should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that is the mentality that you have
to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these numbers that I'm looking at
really real?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like, again, like, you know,
you hear, I hear for a while in
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington, they were calling them THC
scores.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a fucking score.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you didn't win a race.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an analysis of what's in the
flower that you grew.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, you played a role in that,
but it's mostly genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, anyway, it's just funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, in this world that we're
in, like, there's so much growers ego,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's like, I really like,
let's try to tease those two things apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You and how awesome you are from the weed
that you grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, four talent people that grow
great weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you grow a great flower?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm always impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care who it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, if you're truly producing the
finest, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people like that in my opinion,
helping the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're just growing, like looking
for labs, of course, you can run around
[SPEAKER_04]: the world, telling how real you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't impress me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've seen enough lab reports that
like, I don't like, who cares?
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a, you got a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, we, if you grow enough plants,
especially from seed, you're going to find
[SPEAKER_04]: some big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big, big plants and big, big high
numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, that's like a good thing to
look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the cannabinoids are, you know,
are you seeing neutral cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_04]: acidic cannabinoids or both?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want your neutrals like THC,
CBD, CBG, you want those numbers to be
[SPEAKER_04]: really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's an indicator that your lab
report is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you sent me like, for example,
so you sent me one, one had like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was like three and a,
three and a four percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those are, we had a, we had,
we called the swag flag and it's really
[SPEAKER_04]: like under 1%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would just discard anything that was
under 1% terpene content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're, they're not like they're
80s weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that they're bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not the oiliest, dankest,
like super drippy, oily wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we would just automatically
anything under, it doesn't even get
[SPEAKER_04]: considered.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the, for, you know, quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we started, you know,
this was a few years ago, but we were,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, getting into the four or 5%
range and through breeding the highest
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenoid producing plants, we were able
to get some like outliers that were up to
[SPEAKER_04]: like even 7% or even 8%, which is like
ridiculously oily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you can do that,
but again, like you really want to have
[SPEAKER_04]: confidence in the lab that you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a, as a breeder, like a home
breeder, it gets really fucking expensive
[SPEAKER_04]: to use 30 party, third party labs because
you're growing a hundred plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's like a $10,000 analytical
bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In most cases, like even if you were to
turn around and sell every gram of that
[SPEAKER_04]: crop, you're not getting like,
you know, unless you're growing huge
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, you're not getting that 10 grand
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So doing that, that kind of breeding has
to be funded by people with, with pockets
[SPEAKER_04]: or somebody that has an understanding
that, Hey, I'm going to make an investment
[SPEAKER_04]: in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the result that comes out of the end
is going to have value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and so nowadays, like you'll see
those plants that are like up into the 5%,
[SPEAKER_04]: like 5%, I'm not going to say it's a
maxima in the market, but like,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I see someone with a 5% or even when
I consider it might be 30% inflated,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, wow, good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grew that well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I see eights, I'm really skeptical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, they're not possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that they're possible because we've
made them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you've got like six lines and all
of them are 8%ers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You won like $5 billion lotteries in a
row.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the probability of that is really
fucking low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when the probability is really low,
something shifty is probably going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this isn't about calling anybody out
or saying whatever your shit stuff like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, somebody show the 38% labs
flower, the 38% total cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is like exceptionally high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the lab report.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I called up Josh, you know,
I know Josh and, and Alec from there,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are two of the owners and I called
up Alec and I said, dude, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's up with this number?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people are showing this all over IG
and sending it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me what's going on with the sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, when we get a number over,
you know, I think it was 32 or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but when they, when they have a number
that hits a certain thing, it go back to
[SPEAKER_04]: the sample, start from the beginning
again, and yeah, full process,
[SPEAKER_04]: reanalyze it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it a reprep, run a reprep on
that sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it came back like, you know,
within the same small window, but it was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, yeah, it's a real number.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have these massive fucking
numbers where it's like, all the stars
[SPEAKER_04]: aligned and the plants treated perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the most bang in genetic and the
dry and everything is done perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you preserve that beautiful specimen
and get it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you, when you show me your samples
and you have that one that was higher,
[SPEAKER_04]: all I can tell you is it seems high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean it's wrong, but it's one
to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's anomalous and there's two anomalies.
[SPEAKER_03]: In those three samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, so even if it was just based on
the numbers, I would be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: that doesn't mean that they're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No lab report, no signature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even on a lab report,
you know, the lab never saw missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like all those things combined.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like red flag, red flag, red flag,
red flag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, you know, the only way to
really know all these things is to run
[SPEAKER_04]: that sample, that, that plant to five
different grows and analyze it that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that makes you kind of see what's the
range of what that plant does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess it could be an anomalous,
it could be an anomalous, anomalously good
[SPEAKER_03]: grow just that one round.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that the only time you'll ever
see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, like, I think that we can
still say that like, nobody really knows
[SPEAKER_04]: all the secret little switches and bells
and switches to give a plant to make it
[SPEAKER_04]: produce at its optimum, optimum production
every single time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you hit it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it's like, there's a lot of
clouds or sometimes it's shitty weather
[SPEAKER_04]: and you get, you know, like whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, nothing goes perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The air conditioner goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The kind of things that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, in the context of like,
the thing I like consumers to know is that
[SPEAKER_04]: like, it's just to understand that
context, just because it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like I'm out in the market,
you're out in the market, we're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell seeds, we're trying to provide good
products from people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got some chump that's been growing
for like seven years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got an Instagram page with
their crosses and like, everything's,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I, you know, my results range
from like 32 to 40% THC.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason I want to have these
conversations in public is so that like,
[SPEAKER_04]: the consumers, the consumers that are
watching us, they can become informed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when they see the used car sales
and seed pushers that like are everywhere
[SPEAKER_04]: in this fucking market, every left turn,
like every second account that follows me
[SPEAKER_04]: is something genetics or something labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, really all your lab already.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got like a tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about, it's all about marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about trying to fucking make
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I like making a living out
of the cannabis would be nice for
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I really have taken this to
like a stupid level of passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In depthness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, when I have to stand beside
like Joe Blow, that's like, spouting
[SPEAKER_04]: nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I just, you know, and I'm not
competing, not even competing for an
[SPEAKER_04]: audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like, I'm at a conference,
I'm speaking on a panel besides some dude
[SPEAKER_04]: that's like spouting nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just like, Jesus Christ,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard when you love something that
much and you fit that many, that many
[SPEAKER_03]: years into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to watch you get bastardized
super fast around you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the only way to do that is to like,
you know, is to try to explain to people
[SPEAKER_04]: why your shit's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what you see, like all this time and
energy that I put into learning and
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding all this stuff, like why it
makes a difference in our seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's demoralizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's demoralizing to have to sit there and
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the only way to really have people
recognize this is to like educate all of
[SPEAKER_04]: our consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that people can be informed and people
can like not get caught in the carnival,
[SPEAKER_04]: get caught up with the carnival barkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, it's like trying to
walk across a field, like avoiding cow
[SPEAKER_04]: patties.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a loose bunch of stuff on labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what other stuff you want to
cover or there's questions from the
[SPEAKER_04]: audience or stuff that we want to try.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone asked, are inaccurate percentages
fabricated by a false standards when using
[SPEAKER_03]: the GC?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean a standard?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think the answer is yes,
lab results can be falsified.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can also be there are all the time,
as we've explained with that 15% thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you didn't understand and see that,
go back and watch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an inherent amount of normal
variation and acceptable laboratory error
[SPEAKER_04]: that influences the end results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like when you put in the flower and you
get back that lab report, that didn't come
[SPEAKER_04]: from God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't believe that somebody didn't
hand that down to the divine and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the divine ultimate truth.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, hey, we measured your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the measurement that we got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the number.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, what you should understand
is that that number is like has an
[SPEAKER_04]: acceptable variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other side of the question,
do people manipulate these laboratories?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: In every district, there have been
laboratories that have had their bombings
[SPEAKER_04]: spanked because like it's like you take
like, you know, there was somebody in a
[SPEAKER_04]: Leafley article, somebody did this and
laid out like a thousand lab reports.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took all the statistical averages of
all these different labs and every labs
[SPEAKER_04]: statistical average went on on a graph
with a different color curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, like everybody is all lined over
this one specific area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you got one lab that's like
shifted to the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their whole curve is like shifted to the
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, okay, well, what the fuck
are these guys doing wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the truth is, and it happens in every
district, higher lab results get more
[SPEAKER_04]: sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, there's an incentive for labs
to give higher results because they're a
[SPEAKER_04]: profit for profit service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a benefit for growers to seek
those labs out and maybe pay a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: more for a higher number.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's a bad design.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the answer, you can't go back to
that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do labs manipulate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not say all labs, but say a
percentage of labs do manipulate and that
[SPEAKER_04]: can be done intentionally or
unintentionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way it setups right for corruption.
[SPEAKER_04]: If, if one wants to be corrupt,
it's you have to, and again, it's about
[SPEAKER_04]: this passion thing that we were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you seeking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you seeking to market a product or are
you seeking the ultimate truth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you seeing the answers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, if you're not controlling that
agenda, you're getting played by it,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're a consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, you know, like say for example,
like, you know, you, I go through all this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff and you say to me, you know,
dude, I really want to be like high
[SPEAKER_04]: integrity seed bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do everything the right
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you show me what you're doing it the
right way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have more faith in you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if like, I resonate with that
kind of thing and I say, Hey, Matt's doing
[SPEAKER_04]: all the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, he's demonstrating that like,
Hey, I got this lab report, but maybe it
[SPEAKER_04]: was a little high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like something's questionable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shows you got integrity.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm a customer, I'm going to support
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are, again, that's like a value
judgment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that I value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that might not value those
things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like as, and as you can see it,
like a lot of other people are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The jungle boys is the hottest shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go grab whatever they got.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't, the value system is not the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, next question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the education system's not the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like what we've been trying to do
with the whole breeder syndicate thing has
[SPEAKER_03]: been, it's been tough because we decided a
long time ago, the only way to combat
[SPEAKER_03]: disinformation and misinformation is to
educate, but you can't force people to
[SPEAKER_03]: want to educate.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you can do is lay it out for the
people that want to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been pushing this ball and pill
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: More people are getting to the point where
they want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just it's changing over time,
but it takes time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's like everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, what you and I
consider good music, that ain't what's on
[SPEAKER_04]: the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cannabis industry is going to be
no different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's going to be people that
really understand they're really
[SPEAKER_04]: passionate and they really want to have
some beautiful things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's like the 90% that are
going to listen to Justin Bieber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And smoke Bieber butt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have some, I have some questions I
want to run through.
[SPEAKER_03]: It refers to testing, but it, it refers to
genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you cool with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of a, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if there's an answer
to it necessarily, but do you know how far
[SPEAKER_03]: we are in mapping the cannabis genome as
far as are we able to tell real genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: relation as far as like S1 variation and,
and parental lines, father, cousin,
[SPEAKER_03]: sister, is that even something in cannabis
that you could do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't go and like seek that information
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the weird things with the
phylos.
[SPEAKER_04]: What files is going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they were doing the run around,
trying to get samples and they actually
[SPEAKER_04]: approached me at one point in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, not interested.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I will do is I said, Hey,
I've got all these self populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't I help?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we look at like 50 individuals
from the self population and then explore
[SPEAKER_04]: the variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then now we've got like, we've,
we've shown, Hey, here's like the parental
[SPEAKER_04]: clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the heterozygosity by sequencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grown a hundred offspring of the self.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it seemed like that was the most,
like what people went to phylos for was
[SPEAKER_03]: that information more so than anything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pitch was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like collect your star on the
galaxy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and it was like, it's kind of like
that whole, like we can show you your
[SPEAKER_04]: name.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be up in lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's fucking nonsense, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People fall and fall for that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, when we, when I don't mean we,
but I mean, when humanity first did the
[SPEAKER_04]: human genome project, it was like,
Oh my God, we're going to know everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the whole genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be able to treat disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you've got one white guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you think that that encompasses
the genetic variation that exists in like
[SPEAKER_04]: the Jewish or the, or the African or the
African population or like the North?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, South Africa or like Asia versus,
you know, like wherever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the next evolution that came out of
that was called the thousand genomes
[SPEAKER_04]: project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, once you got a thousand
genomes, now you can start looking at all
[SPEAKER_04]: the different genes and seeing,
okay, here's kind of like a catalog of
[SPEAKER_04]: the, of the genomic variation that exists
in the species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like, at least it gives us a look at,
Hey, there's way more variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are, you know, folks like
medicinal genomics and some other groups,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think medicinal genomics probably have
like, I would say they've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they've been doing it like more or
less the longest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, so they've started to get like,
yeah, you can go in and you're one of
[SPEAKER_04]: their clients and you paid out your shit
sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can compare, you know, your snips
versus other essentially snips or genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: misspelling is in a word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, and because these things are
repeated over time, if you have a,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a genetic misspelling that happens in
skunk, and then you cross it in the skunk,
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern lights and skunk caves and skunk
at Danny, like you have a probability of
[SPEAKER_04]: finding that misspelling in all of those
different lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So over time, you can use those to build
like a family tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we haven't really done a good job
of at this point yet is saying this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small genetic change results in X.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like we've got a bunch of DNA letters
and we can see it as variation of these
[SPEAKER_04]: data letters, but it's like, okay,
what does that correlate to in a plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the hard work is correlating
the phenotypic data with the genetic data.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is going to take time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's got to be years away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to be, it's always going to
be an ongoing process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with corn, they've done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a pretty good job of it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, listen, we've got like,
we've got what's called an annotated
[SPEAKER_04]: genome, which means you can look up,
Hey, you want to look up like the fatty
[SPEAKER_04]: acid desaturase gene that is involved in
like, you know, so plant cells,
[SPEAKER_04]: what happens when plants get really cold,
they need oil content in the cell
[SPEAKER_04]: membranes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a gene involved in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, like I can look up that gene and
actually now go and find out exactly where
[SPEAKER_04]: it is in the cannabis because they've
said, Hey, this small section of the
[SPEAKER_04]: chromosome matches up with this gene and
all of the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the gene that does this in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but like, again, it's like,
you know, that that gene, that segment of
[SPEAKER_04]: the DNA sequence is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know what every variant that exists
for that gene and the result of those
[SPEAKER_04]: variants are?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're, we're starting to build that
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one of the things you know,
McKernan, medicinal genomics, McKernan is
[SPEAKER_04]: no dummy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He looked up, he was like, Oh,
we're gonna start looking at the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's gonna be one of the first
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they sequence the whole
genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the first thing that they do,
they take the microscope out, it's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: microscope or a magnifying glass,
but it's an analogy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take the magnifying glass out and go
and you look at that region of the genome
[SPEAKER_04]: that has those genes involved in
cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this one's got a break in the gene or
this one has two copies of the gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're starting to tease it apart
for like, some of the major genes of
[SPEAKER_04]: interest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because they don't grow plants and
they don't do those correlational studies
[SPEAKER_04]: between genetic data and phenotypes,
they can't generate that kind of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was low build.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was interesting going back and forth
with phylos at the very end before they
[SPEAKER_03]: shut their doors and giving them known
parents and the known children cuts and
[SPEAKER_03]: watching them come back and say there was
no relation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really interesting watching that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, they put their, their whole
reputation on the line to do it on top of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it makes you wonder what's going on
because I mean, you know, they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, did they fuck up a sample of
the lab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they not just not running them and
taking your money and telling you,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that could be funny too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no way of knowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no way of knowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and when we pointed it out,
they shut the doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I'd like to see how long their data
stays up online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like their data sets, because knowing that
it, I would think that if the more that
[SPEAKER_03]: gets out, the more likely people are to
start asking questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I had like, listen, when they first
started coming up with their things,
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to them, you know, I was,
they offered me a job at one point in
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I left Napero and came back to
Canada, they're like, well, come work for
[SPEAKER_04]: us Napero and just, or at the phylos and,
you know, just give us, give me like two
[SPEAKER_04]: of your CBG seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was, you know, I legalization was
happening in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was over living out of fricking hotels
and the skates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I just, I didn't, I didn't value
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, I, there was too many red flags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so like the way that they were
going at collecting their data was wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because of, you know,
not who I am, but because of like the
[SPEAKER_04]: position I was in with knowing a lot of
people on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And having access to like, you know,
all the known stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, guys, like, I'll just get you
all the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's verified cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, when you're doing a camp
tonic that it came from the guy that read
[SPEAKER_04]: camp comic, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they were like, well,
we don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want real legacy strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we got like, well, why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, you want to take people's
money to give them an answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they were running tests and their
cost was 30 hundred bucks or whatever it
[SPEAKER_04]: was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're charging people hundreds of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, they're just turning them and
burning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and in the meantime, they're learning
all this stuff because they see
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody's samples or like the guy that
faced the test.
[SPEAKER_04]: You only see your sample, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you understand your genetic
data to whatever degree you can say,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look, there's my star on the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like buying an anchor on the
moon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can see what the telescope,
who cares?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like fucking useless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but anyway, you know, anyway,
it's one of those things where it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you're soft to read Tom
Sawyer, but it's like, there's a point in
[SPEAKER_04]: time, I guess, to paint whitewash this
stupid fence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Tom, can I give you my like apple if
you let me whitewash some of your fence?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what philist was doing with
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was lining up like suckers to be
it all turned like because of I did that
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding work from napero then there was
the patent that came from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of people all bent out of
shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, you're fucking philos
you're working with philos and patenting
[SPEAKER_04]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you dumbasses fell into the fucking
philos trap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actively paid to give away your
fucking information to some big genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're pissed off at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you mad at me like you fell into the
trap, dude.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know the cannabis is cut,
you know, community is funny with that
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like, yeah, like patents are
really freaked out about the patents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now everybody wants patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I think if you truly bred
something, and you created something new,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can get intellectual property
protection by way of patents, like a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: patent in the states, fucking get on with
your bad self now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's got to now it's got to the point
of where you almost have to if you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: stay competitive, because the legal
market's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't patent it, someone else
will.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody can't come along and patent
your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can patent something that is the same
as your shit, if you didn't get to it in
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, really, like what a patent is,
is saying, hey, this, this is a unique
[SPEAKER_04]: thing that I developed is mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this gives you a stamp that says,
hey, that you actually developed that
[SPEAKER_04]: because you have to demonstrate how you
made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to have actual proof that you
crossed x, y, z, and the proof of all this
[SPEAKER_03]: like video?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know how it works?
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to stand up in court, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it can be challenged at any point
in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't do a good enough job,
like you might get it past the USPTO,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might you might get past the patent
examiner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, yeah, this thing appears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if somebody comes along and challenges
you, you might get it past the USPTO.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a later and they can demonstrate
later that, that, hey, you didn't document
[SPEAKER_04]: well enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's these things that call what
you said into question.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's up in front of the judge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, who's going to make a ruling on
whether you actually the patent is valid.
[SPEAKER_04]: A patent is a claim, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't mean that you fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a claim that you own something,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you really own it is a matter for
the courts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like any patent can be challenged.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're going to go through a
patent and all the effort and expense of
[SPEAKER_04]: getting a patent for something that you've
created, you should probably do a good job
[SPEAKER_04]: of describing every like all your home
every last step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because you want to lay out the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So because the story is what gets
published in the patent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody comes along and says,
yeah, this doesn't make sense in your
[SPEAKER_04]: story.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ground for a challenge.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why when you see like,
you know, I'm not talking about plant
[SPEAKER_04]: patents, but if you read some of these
patents on like genes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, or for example, in a chemo
type, so it'll be like, we're patenting
[SPEAKER_04]: every plant in turpinoline dominance with
type three or type two, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid profile, meaning CBD and CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means everything from 1%,
2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll literally see that fucking list
out like, you know, one through 40%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For clarity that they say, this patent
claims every plant that is 1%,
[SPEAKER_04]: 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you document it as tightly
controlled as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea that patent attorneys do is
like, you want to write patents that are
[SPEAKER_04]: defensible in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you try to close every loophole that
you can think of.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And patents are different than trademarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Archive runs trademarks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, trademarks are, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trademark is how you sell a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, look, when we start talking about
intellectual property on plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: wherever the person is watching this in
the world, like if you're in Europe,
[SPEAKER_04]: or you're in Canada, or you're in the
United States, or you're in China,
[SPEAKER_04]: totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something in the, there's a system
that is like accepted all over the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: called UPOB.
[SPEAKER_04]: And UPOB is essentially the union for the
protection of plant varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're the guys that created this
overarching system that said, these are
[SPEAKER_04]: the ways that we evaluate to see who owns
or develops a new plant variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's an international treaty made by
an international organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the countries come together,
most of the countries in the world come
[SPEAKER_04]: together and have signed this treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, for example, you know,
call it like New Zealand, say they signed
[SPEAKER_04]: on in like the 1974 edition of the treaty,
and the United States signed on in like a
[SPEAKER_04]: later version, call it 1991, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are made up numbers and dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're only beholden to the version of the
treaty to which you signed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so, and then you sign the treaty,
all these like, for example, they go home,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so there's this international
treaty, the United States signs on the
[SPEAKER_04]: international treaty, hey, we're gonna be
part of this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they go back to the United States,
and they write a set of legislation that
[SPEAKER_04]: backs up the treaty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that legislation is totally unique
to the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you follow the overarching principles
of the umbrella organization, that top
[SPEAKER_04]: level org.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, every country is a silo with
their own system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, patent, plant patents,
per se, only exist in the United States
[SPEAKER_04]: and Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no such thing as a patent,
plant patent in Canada, or Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use Breeders' Rights, the Breeders'
Rights system that's overseen by UPOC.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the major differences between those
two is that a patent, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_04]: disclose or make available.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, when we talk about
international registration of plant
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties or plant cultivars, what that
does is so I develop whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: call it like a blueberry sweet,
let's call it blueberry sweets kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, I find a blueberry sweet kind of
plant that's totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I register it, I declare the parents,
I do the whole spiel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he says, okay, Ryan, this plant is
yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: We recognize that you're the developer of
this plant, this one plant that you
[SPEAKER_04]: selected out of this population.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna give you a cultivar
registration recognition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a registered cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you get out of that is the rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, now that plant that I have,
that anybody that wants to grow that plant
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere else in the world, they can grow
that plant, but I get the royalties or I
[SPEAKER_04]: have the rights to the royalties or
whatever profits come from the development
[SPEAKER_04]: section of that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you don't get to say is nobody else
can use this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, one of the conditions that you
have to do is make your plant available to
[SPEAKER_04]: other breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason is like, hey, the reasoning
from the top level org is, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: we recognize that you developed that plant
and it's special and it's awesome and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to give you 17 years of
economic exclusivity around that plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant genetic resources are not yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The entire globe has the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody on the planet has the right to
that plant for use in the betterment of
[SPEAKER_04]: all plants for humanity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, the plant that you have the
certification on, we recognize it as
[SPEAKER_04]: yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to share it with everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of people can take my shit
and breed it and improve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have patent, I don't have to give it
out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can control who gets it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it truly is your piece of
property.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your, you have ownership over that
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes, that's, that makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a weird, like unique thing
that happens in the States because you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys have these patents.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're recognized in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not recognized anywhere else in
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one form of patents.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other forms of patents,
like there's utility patents and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: all this other shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I think, you know, rather than
doing a show on patents, it's just good to
[SPEAKER_04]: recognize that that's kind of the way it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, get it, get yourself a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also do cultivar and variety
registrations in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with patents around, why would
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing about being in part of the
international variety registration is that
[SPEAKER_04]: you, you don't only have, like for you,
if you're only growing in your clients or
[SPEAKER_04]: only in the States, fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your patent in the States.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're protected.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you're, you're protected in the
States.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take that plant to Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody recognizes your IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you might want, if you're
going to be doing business
[SPEAKER_04]: internationally, you might want to get a
form of intellectual property protection
[SPEAKER_04]: that is recognized internationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear Chimera talk about
chitazan, jasmonic acid and salicylic
[SPEAKER_03]: acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something that you know a lot
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I mean, I know a little bit about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not like a plant physiology guy that I
have that stuff on the top of my,
[SPEAKER_04]: on the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're, they're signaling
chemicals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So chitazan, chitazan is not chitazan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what's, that's the molecule
that's in the shells of crustaceans,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's some evidence that it does
stuff in plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not my area of specialty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk to you about what is
Chimera excited about genetically that's
[SPEAKER_03]: around right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something you're working on or something
that maybe you saw recently that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: really stoked on that's novel?
[SPEAKER_04]: My list, I get off on the variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like new stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, I like, I like when our
understanding grows, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for me in genetics, it's like,
I, you know, we talked about it a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit with, with Caleb on the Shango show
the other day, but yeah, like when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: selfing a plant, it's not just about
looking through the population and saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, oh, this plant's great because of
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to understand all the traits in the
plant and how they're inherited,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how it's breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like being able to take apart
machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you can take it apart and put it back
together, then you can reassemble it in
[SPEAKER_04]: new ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's really what, you know,
like when, for example, the phial story
[SPEAKER_04]: came out, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The skeleton compounds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to now be able to go into a
breeding program, take a plant with
[SPEAKER_04]: phials, self it, and see how does the,
like what happens in the distribution of
[SPEAKER_04]: that phial expression in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you analyze that,
then you can kind of get to understand,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you can develop a hypothesis about
how that trade is inherited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you know how that trade is inherited,
then you can bring it into any other
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's like kind of what I nerd on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably doesn't sound very exciting
to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, yeah, that's the kind of
stuff that I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I don't really like there's,
I have favorites, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I look at cannabis, I don't really
look at it in that almost call it like a
[SPEAKER_04]: prejudicial way where we're segregating
plants on quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I only like one type.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I've got my favorite dogs,
but for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: I see the very, I see the inherent value
in all of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Funky, like ruderalis stuff with the otter
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was like, I collect that
stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I'm in Morocco, when I was in
Morocco, I found these plants that are,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a, there's a hemp variety called
panorama.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially the plant grows like a
globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like all the branches are completely
equal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes like this round bush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this hemp breeder named even Boschke
years ago, he developed a variety of it
[SPEAKER_04]: for like as an ornamental variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the only, it was at the time
it was the only ornamental cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: variety that had been bred.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he thought, Oh yeah, people planted
their garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these little weird globe balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I found a plant like that in
Morocco and I was like, fuck, you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: take some seeds out of that sucker and
take it home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's an oddity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an oddity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in the current cannabis massive
gene pool as far as what's being worked
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I really do get off on the variation
that you see in the species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because I don't think anybody's done a
very good job at like characterizing the
[SPEAKER_04]: variation that exists on any given set of
traits, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were in April, we did,
we started to do a pretty good job on
[SPEAKER_04]: turps and on, and then once we,
you know, we did turps at first and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we were like, you know, you end up with a
plant that has the same terpene,
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene propylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got two plants that are identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: That look identical by lab report,
but you smell them and they're totally
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, okay, this is clearly not the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to look at other chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you pull up the GCMS and you start
looking for regions between your peaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, what else is in there that
we're like just driving over, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not seeing in the analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you start looking at that and
then you find, Oh, there's other scent
[SPEAKER_04]: molecules that are involved in other
molecules with scent that are involved in
[SPEAKER_04]: our perception.
[SPEAKER_04]: The smell, because again, it's like,
I've used this analogy before,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's like, it's kind of like going to
the orchestra and then, and then turn to
[SPEAKER_04]: the guy that's never heard orchestra music
and saying, Hey, do you hear the oboe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, he perceives that in the overall sound
of what he's perceiving as the sound of
[SPEAKER_04]: the orchestra, but he hasn't trained
himself to be able to like identify that
[SPEAKER_04]: one note, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and scent is an orchestra of
molecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we smell those molecules,
we get them all at once that we perceive
[SPEAKER_04]: it as one thing, but really it's one
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's kind of like looking at
the Mona Lisa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you can say, yeah, it's one
painting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, it's one painting,
but it's like, look at all the intricacy
[SPEAKER_04]: that exists in it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the brush details.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really the difference between
that's what happens when you, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I did, I missed the thing last night,
but I imagine it's the kind of stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys were talking about last night,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went through his kit and I,
I went through and smelled each individual
[SPEAKER_03]: one, like the terpenes, they're all in
different percentages and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, it was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: There, there were certain ones that I was
smelling like lemonade and a few others
[SPEAKER_03]: that I just, it totally wasn't what I
thought it would be like oranges.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's a few different lemonings
in there, but yeah, it was, it was wild,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he, he, he wants to send you one of
the full kits too, if you ever want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he, he wanted to know crybaby,
uh, I'm curious how soma clonal variance
[SPEAKER_03]: fit into the whole plant patents or whole
patent sphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soma clonal variance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So soma clonal variation is like,
let's call it, it's usually referred to as
[SPEAKER_04]: the genetic variation that comes out of
tissue culture, but you can really,
[SPEAKER_04]: so a somatic cell is like any cell in your
body that is not destined to become like
[SPEAKER_04]: sperm or egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, audio cut for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we dropped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
Go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arms are just going to keep going off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so some kind of variation is like the
variation that exists as a result of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the somatic cell is like any cell
in your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was saying, it doesn't become a
germ line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't become again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to become a gamete.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: In plants, we talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: From what we see the variation that exists
when plants come out of tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_04]: like there's a variant that we recognize
as a phenotypic variant, which we're
[SPEAKER_04]: noticing a change in morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, probably what's happened is the
hormones that we've been using in the
[SPEAKER_04]: tissue culture processes have caused a
genetic mutation that is the result of
[SPEAKER_04]: that variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I'm just trying to like
repurpose the question to say like,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's the degree of natural variation?
[SPEAKER_04]: That exists in the cannabis plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a paper that was just done on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there was some flaws in the
paper, but they, they actually sequenced
[SPEAKER_04]: all these different plates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they took samples from a big mother
plant called like, you know, it was like
[SPEAKER_04]: five or six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually not in the healthiest
condition, which, you know, it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, maybe that's, that should have
been documented in the study.
[SPEAKER_04]: But bottom line is they took a whole bunch
of genetic samples of different shoot
[SPEAKER_04]: tips, bottom of the plant, top of the
plant, medium, middle part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lo and behold, there's all these
genetic mutations that exist even with
[SPEAKER_04]: just a mother plant, forget tissue
culture, just within a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, whether that is a factor of them
doing a bad analysis or not, let's forget
[SPEAKER_04]: that and just assume that it happens.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants, and we've seen this in trees,
mutations happen as plants grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you got like a plant that throws
off two shoots, right, so this is the main
[SPEAKER_04]: stem here, you get two shoots come out of
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: When this guy has a mutation, every cell
that develops from that cell with a
[SPEAKER_04]: mutation is going to carry that mutation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've got literally got two
branches on a tree that are going off in
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways that have different
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that happens in a gene, if that
mutation happens in a gene that's
[SPEAKER_04]: important, in an important trait for
cannabis, that could lead to like a change
[SPEAKER_04]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're probably heard like
someone's asking like a sport that's that
[SPEAKER_04]: is a sport, but a sport is like a shoot of
the mutation, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for example, I was just going to
mention like, maybe people have heard
[SPEAKER_04]: about like Pinot Noir is a grape variety
that's been around for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have these new grapes that are
called Pinot Noir or Pinot Blanc,
[SPEAKER_04]: which means Pinot White and Pinot Gris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinot Gris is actually kind of a pinky
grape, pinky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a sport that they found on
like somebody was walking through a
[SPEAKER_04]: vineyard of Pinot Noir and noticed that
one branch on a plant had gray grapes,
[SPEAKER_04]: not purple grapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there is a mutation that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the color gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe some other genes as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point is you snip off that,
that sport or that cutting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant is actually different enough
from the registered Pinot Noir variety
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can actually take Pinot that new
short, the new sport Pinot Gris or Pinot
[SPEAKER_04]: Blanc.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe not patent it, but you can
register it for a variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patents is a little bit different because
the way they analyze, the way they,
[SPEAKER_04]: they kind of characterize them is a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's, it's like, you know,
when you do your plant registration,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, oh yeah, the grapes are purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like you go back and it's like,
you got this one and the grapes aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obviously not the same variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can name it as a new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, truth is, is like these things
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They happen in plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The green tree to which they happen in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we know that they know,
we know that it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the degree to which we know that
it happens is probably still up in the
[SPEAKER_04]: air.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if that answers the
question, but maybe there's a little
[SPEAKER_04]: context for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about, and now we're going to
some of your strains that you've done in
[SPEAKER_03]: the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about what my favorite
strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've probably gone over it before,
but since this is a new episode,
[SPEAKER_03]: mental floss, like that, that was one that
touched me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a, I'm a whore for purples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of, it was made during an
era where purples were pretty obscure at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the purple craze had gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not many people were breeding with
purples, but mental floss always had this
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful purple senescence during flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it turns at the end, it's a beautiful
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when it does one of those things,
I guess it's got a bunch of carotenoids in
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The carotenoids, like when you look at,
for example, I don't know if you,
[SPEAKER_04]: you probably don't have maple trees down
where you are, but you might've seen them
[SPEAKER_04]: in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go from like green.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when the green, the plant,
you know, when the plant's going into the
[SPEAKER_04]: fall and they're about to shed their
leaves, they pull as much resources back
[SPEAKER_04]: out of the leaves into the trunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can save those building blocks for
next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's left, what happens is the
plants go, the leaves go from green to
[SPEAKER_04]: either red or yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason they're red or yellow is
because they've got molecules in the leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: called carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And carotenoids just comes from that
yellow, orangey pigment color.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they're called that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like kind of like carrots, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But those carotenoids kind of hide behind
the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with mental floss, again,
when you, when you give it a good flush at
[SPEAKER_04]: the end and the plant, you know,
cannibalizes all that, that chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_04]: you end up with these beautiful kind of
rainbow, yellow and purple leaves in the
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant is also like, it makes some of
my favorite hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any cannabis that I've ever come across.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It melts like fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you, someone's saying fuck carrots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck carrots.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you, when you, it melts like crazy
and it's also very up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would smoke that stuff thinking I'm
going to have another puff and go to bed
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know, I got the computer two hours
later, type it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it gets you going and it yields
like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, it's just a great plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you source your stuff for the
incense haze?
[SPEAKER_04]: The incense haze, one of the parents of
sweet scents, the other one is a seed that
[SPEAKER_04]: came from this dude in New York state that
said he got out of the piff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it is or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Frank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I call it Frank's incense haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it really smelled like incense.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you grew it, like it was the reason I
paired that one with the sweet scents is
[SPEAKER_04]: because the two, like very often,
not very often, not very often,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll come across two plants that are so
close to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be the same plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so sweet skunk and this plant were
like in almost every sense identical to
[SPEAKER_04]: the part where like you'd walk into a
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you got, when you know,
if you have plants for like 10,
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 years in your room, you get to learn
like little idiosync, sorry, idiosyncrasy
[SPEAKER_04]: with the leaves and the way that like,
you know, the way that the leaves come off
[SPEAKER_04]: the main frond or the serration pattern or
whatever it is, you get to know them like
[SPEAKER_04]: a parent can identify twins, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's one of the twin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, and these plants would get
confused, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That people would confuse them all the
time because they're so close together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, anyway, yeah, it was, so when those
two came together, so I didn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you think I was selfing the sweet scents
cause I wanted to understand the
[SPEAKER_04]: inheritance pattern of some of the rare
ball of tiles that are in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the self, although it's pure,
it's a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a wider range of like,
cause it's expressing all the,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the, the hidden variation that exists
within one genome, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or those that self population.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I crossed those two sister plants
together, when I, when I do a,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, when I do cross using a reversal,
I'll always hit the plant to itself
[SPEAKER_04]: because usually you're trying to get that
pure line, but I also always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the pollen is flying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will just make a bunch of other crosses
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, you have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, when you're going down a
program, it's like, oh, Hey, I lost a
[SPEAKER_04]: trade or this line doesn't have a trait
that I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go back to the line with the trait and
you've already got the hybrid that's 50%
[SPEAKER_04]: within the line you're working in.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some guy did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but anyway, so when you cross those
two things together, the, the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the incense haze, which was the simply or
is this the ball?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they, they came up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much bigger and better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and very consistent to type,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so it kind of was the best of both
worlds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people ask me, it's like,
you know, when they're, when they're
[SPEAKER_04]: sniffing around that thing, I always say,
Hey, get both of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: get the self for breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got the pure stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little home, a little more
homozygous or a greater chance of being
[SPEAKER_04]: homozygous, but the hybrid that performs
the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of like a grower's performance,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it really depends on what,
what the customer is looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like to take my time to do like a
proper consult with someone because I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: be like, Hey, somebody grew this stuff,
the lemon floss.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, what are you,
what are you doing it for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are you using it for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I don't want you to just buy the
seeds that you think you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to have the seeds that are
going to be the best for what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a strain that you can think of
that you have been looking for for many
[SPEAKER_03]: years or strain you'd like to encounter
from the past that you have it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, like again, we had a
straight discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would, in terms of plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are there rare phenotypes that I've
seen in the plastic that I know that I'd
[SPEAKER_04]: love to see again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, of course it's kind of one of
those things that it's like, if it comes
[SPEAKER_04]: by and passes without grabbing a copy and
then solving it, like it may be gone to
[SPEAKER_04]: the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to recognize that it is,
but you know, you're always looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: those things in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just, I had a plant when I was
relatively young and it was called
[SPEAKER_04]: Liscundi sweetie.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, an island off of a Texas state
of British Columbia and the straight there
[SPEAKER_04]: called Liscundi and it's no power.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's essentially a hippie commune.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, they grow a lot of dope up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, this one, like it was before,
I had every, I'd never even heard of the
[SPEAKER_04]: island at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was quite young living on the other side
of the country and a friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_04]: a friend of mine, that's what we think of
Breeder Steve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your questions are funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, this, this flower ended up back
with me and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like incredibly electric,
super strong, really up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, other than the name
Liscundi sweetie, I never knew anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to come across those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like the beautiful girl that you
dated in high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might not find another one like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So marry her while you can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we need to get your genetics here in
the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know there's a lot of people
who really want to grab chimeras stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anywhere available in the States
right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't sell them to the States,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there is that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, when I worked down there,
part of, you know, becoming a landowner,
[SPEAKER_04]: being an immigrant is bad with your
fingerprint scan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like me, me sending seeds into the
States ain't really a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably, probably not, but yeah,
maybe someone can work on doing some
[SPEAKER_03]: chimera genetics out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Breeder's retail is going to come
up and get going again, but they're a UK
[SPEAKER_04]: bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, you know, with them having done
Brexit, it's a, like, it's a bit of a shit
[SPEAKER_04]: show, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as easy to do the business out of
the UK wise, but it's perfectly legal for
[SPEAKER_04]: us to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people that want to do that can,
you know, get contacted me and we can hook
[SPEAKER_04]: you up to the UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately the way the laws are,
and with that whole fingerprint and having
[SPEAKER_04]: worked for the man thing, it's like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crybaby made a comment on your limoncello.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I thought the limoncello was very
consistent and was an excellent breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's done some stuff with it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sweet skin cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty consistent smell wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit of variation I find
still in, like in morphology, you grow
[SPEAKER_04]: enough plants of the flower morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's just what I meant from that
context.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the smoking, they're more or less the
same, but they're very close.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're within that type.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I wouldn't lay down if I
was going to grow an indoor set of table,
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't lay down seed from those
because there's just, if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell the flower, there's a little,
for me, there's a little bit too much
[SPEAKER_04]: inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is there anything else you want to
cover before we rock it out?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some BC locals up with seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these new eugenics need suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's seeds that are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, everybody's, you know what it's
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's known from the Cali stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cali world owns the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain owned the world 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: BC owned the world 10 years before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll vary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll move around.
[SPEAKER_04]: The work, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing the work down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people that are growing
seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And listen, that's the only way that we're
going to come up with new, better
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fucking keep growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as it's appealing and you have to
grow clones for your business model,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just keep growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you don't grow seeds,
we're never going to find anything new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're always going to be stuck with
the same shit that we had five years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And listen, sometimes it's tough for my,
you know, it's like, I see, I can say,
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it cannabis fashion, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I like to hold on to old cuts
because it's like, they go out of favor,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you bring them back like five,
10 years later and people are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, dude, it's the mini
skirt or the bell bottoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they keep it back, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought I'd see Skunk One make a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it did, you know, a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm laughing at the Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody actually asked me to sit in
and help use genetics to help referees and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's like, you got like five guys in
California that are like, I've got the
[SPEAKER_04]: original Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, you do, do you?
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever heard of Sam?
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever heard of Dave?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then you don't have the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's that whole ego thing that like
people want to get together and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and be like, Hey, I got the
original.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, fucking wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an interesting plant, but it's one
of those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like, you know, it was one of the
first, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The first record reading lines and Dave
started selling in Holland and then every
[SPEAKER_04]: seed company was like, well, the Skunk's
selling, we got to sell the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, then Dutch Passions got it
and Sensei's got a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then everybody's got a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every fucking seed bank in the world,
more or less has a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they all original?
[SPEAKER_04]: How much are they any like, you know,
it'd be really interesting to have like an
[SPEAKER_04]: acre and have all of them and grow them
all side by side and just see what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: like.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably like not even,
you know, they're probably not even a leg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this dude that bought the seeds back
in like, you know, 96 or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: when he got them, you probably didn't get
them from the original guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your stuff original?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's a funny, it's a funny
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I was actually quite a bit confused
to see one of the most spread around seed
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that has existed in the last 50
years have a bunch of new people pop up
[SPEAKER_04]: and be like, yo, I've got the original.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then throw down big dollars,
even though it's never been gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always been available.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what like, what is the original?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the original was a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a named population.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like, you know, it's not like
today it's like OG Kush or Cookies or
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking Runs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like these start as cutting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it always makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, for example,
blue dream and blue dream came around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was one cut, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: More or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there ended up being a couple that
were very similar, but there was one cut
[SPEAKER_04]: and then people would come on and be like,
I got this blue dream Santa Cruz blue
[SPEAKER_04]: dream thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they'll like spank white widow on
it or some OG or whatever, some random
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they sell the seeds as blue
dream, blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now people grow those seeds in a different
market where they don't know what the
[SPEAKER_04]: original blue dream is.
[SPEAKER_04]: They pick a mom, they say it's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you've got two plants that are
being passed around the world as if
[SPEAKER_04]: they're both the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them is not even the same
chemical profile as the blue dream.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, cry babies asking how much of the
ancestral skunk did we get to see a fair
[SPEAKER_04]: amount?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we grew out of chucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's some stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ancestral, the people, I don't know if
people know about the ancestral skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were seeds that Dave, when Dave was
moving over to Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, in, in like early eighties,
he brought obviously a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: over.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought like a suitcase of seeds over
and, you know, did various things with
[SPEAKER_04]: them and didn't work with them in various
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: He met a hemp researcher that knew,
um, he met a hemp researcher that was
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially like, he was, he was in a
European country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say which one,
but he was the, he grew, like he was known
[SPEAKER_04]: as the hemp guy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like red hemp, their, their country sold
hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when, when the police would like
they'd come across a cannabis bust,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd go and get him and bring him to the
site and be like, is this drug cannabis or
[SPEAKER_04]: not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this hemp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know black black.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, um, sorry, someone's asking that
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, anyway, Sam arranged for this guy
to grow on his research field.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hector of skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and open populated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially like, you know,
Sam brought those seeds over and they all
[SPEAKER_04]: went in the greenhouse and said,
I did various things, things with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a big bunch of the skunk left
enough to plant like a hector.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they took them to this European
company country and planted him hector in
[SPEAKER_04]: isolation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he and Rob went through the field and
robed all the males and the off types and
[SPEAKER_04]: the, and the females that were not skunk
like, but the rest of it just got fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: open pocket, open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what the ancestral skunk is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, it's the closest thing a
population could be to what was produced
[SPEAKER_04]: in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the other families that came out of
that population were like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were family lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody went in and found two plants and
they crossed them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what came out of that from those one to
one cross is not the same as what was
[SPEAKER_04]: preserved in the overall open population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what the skunk was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, Sam was like, there's all these
people are, you know, crying and whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: about having access to the skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Plastogram?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give them access to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have, they got a low germination
rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they germinate like that,
like 25% or maybe even a little bit less
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't tested them recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're pretty old, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they must've been reproduced like
30, 25, 30 years ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of years ago, Sam was looking at
selling his collection and I actually
[SPEAKER_04]: helped him recatalog the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we got to build, you know,
we went through everything and we did a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole bunch of germination tasks and we
pulled stuff out that was like 25 year old
[SPEAKER_04]: seed that had been stored at like,
you know, four degrees Celsius for 20 plus
[SPEAKER_04]: years, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them germinated at like 80,
90%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So seeds, if they're stored properly and
consistently, they can last a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I got, I got, I got a ton
of those blueberry seeds still left from,
[SPEAKER_04]: from the DDA projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are like, yeah, they're old
seeds, but dude, I can pull fucking the
[SPEAKER_04]: grapefruit sweet skunk out and pop 10 of
them and all 10 of them germinate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it doesn't matter how old the fucking
seed is, if it germinates, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously some people think differently,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there any skunk too in that population
of stuff that he had saved?
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk too wasn't from Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's that from?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody else came along and made it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he ever produced one called
skunk too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, I remember there was some kind of
quote somewhere about him talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: how skunk too was the, the skunkier
version.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't work the skunkier version.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wonder where I read that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to go back and look.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff that gets
attributed to Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like, again, the whole thing
about him in the DDA, like all this shit
[SPEAKER_04]: is attributed to him that's just not even
true.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's little specks of like roots of
truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody took and blew up into this big
weird story and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: misinterpreted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cause he's Mr. Mystery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, like he's an enigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, like, I think after,
like, I think you were treated the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that he's been treated in the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I mean, it's like the same thing
that happened with me and the,
[SPEAKER_04]: my branding for that work that ended up
being patented.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, that already fucking turns on
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, people, like I said,
everywhere, everywhere he went,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like the, you know, the whole Dutch
scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason that people started calling him
DDA was that he was able to come into a
[SPEAKER_04]: country that wasn't his, he's not fucking
Dutch.
[SPEAKER_04]: He went to Holland and as an American
expat and was able, was able to get,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, no, I didn't say rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said hormones for plant tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So rooting hormone is about the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, some of the, the shit that they use.
[SPEAKER_04]: For plant tissue culture can cause
mutations, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but anyway, Sam was able to go into
Holland, set up a business, get a license
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow cannabis from the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody else can do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so of course all the Dutch dudes were
fucking choked, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, how is this not,
this isn't fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's got all this shit, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You must have some context that we don't
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the DEA is an American organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the hell would the DEA go to the
government of a different country and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you gotta let this American grow weed
in your country.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's a stupid fucking sub shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, that's the story that some Dutch
reporter guy came up with and he used to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a written cannabis radio show and he
started them all over the airwaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's fucking true for half the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that where it came from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that where all this started?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it started as a rumor, but that's
when it like got popularized.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember meeting Scott at one point in
time, Shanti Baba and he was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave Watson, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, dude, you've been fucking
fed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same shit I was by Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Neville told me directly that he
knew Sam's DEA handler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knew his handler.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not fucking know what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just spent the nonsense and you came
in late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm just going to ignore your
fucking questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just told it as fatality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like people want to fucking question
you without even knowing like an iota of
[SPEAKER_04]: the fucking truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: But didn't you know it was going to your
apartment?
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fucking making medicine for
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dumb ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what my intentions were.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fucking company that I was working
with at the time that I was employed by
[SPEAKER_04]: that were allowing me to fucking like have
my dream cannabis job and build a fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: multimillion dollar laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Play in, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, it's a job, but it's also a
job that I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the consequences is that these guys
came out and patented a bunch of a class
[SPEAKER_04]: of plants that didn't exist before I made
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like how the hell people like you
can complain is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you obviously have no idea what
you're talking about and are spouting an
[SPEAKER_04]: opinion of like from a place of complete
ignorance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, yeah, I do have to laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I'm emotional about it and
I'm clearly irritated is because I fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: got death threats from people like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went after you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went after you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You went after me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have the full.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have the full picture and no one
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, no, no one had the full picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just went off of, oh my God,
patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's fucking with the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, our community was bred to believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be very conspiratorial.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I knew research scientists that
worked at GW Pharmaceuticals, like doing
[SPEAKER_04]: Petri dish work and experimental design.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like these guys would have the same
experiences that you and I would have
[SPEAKER_04]: taken care of Mary's nephew with epilepsy
down the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have personal relationships
with like these kids that couldn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: access to cannabis and they would come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of GW Pharmaceuticals,
that was doing the work with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were allowed, they were able to get
access to the medicines they needed to
[SPEAKER_04]: change their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like big pharma or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't fucking have, I don't have a
problem with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're helping people in like a
context, again, they're operating in a
[SPEAKER_04]: context of prohibition where like these
medicines can't get to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a post today about Marinol,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's chirping me about Marinol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh no, it's made by in a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, a molecule is a molecule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're fucking starving for water,
you don't care whether that water was made
[SPEAKER_04]: from like burning fossil fuels or mixing
hydrogen and oxygen in a laboratory or
[SPEAKER_04]: purifying it out of fucking shit sewer
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like once it comes out at the end and it's
pure fucking water, it's water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the same with THC and it's the
same with CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if those medicines can go to someone
that can benefit from those medicines that
[SPEAKER_04]: they couldn't access other medicines,
otherwise why the hell do you have a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that it comes from a place
where it's like, you feel like all the
[SPEAKER_04]: government's not letting you, you,
you do your art and grow the crop that you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what the result is dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't change the laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like we've been fighting for that hard
for fucking 30, 40 plus years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've been involved for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I founded a political party in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a founding member of the federal
marijuana party in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: To effectuate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, I get that you're pissed off
and you're scared of big pharma,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you have to fucking direct that anger
in a channel that's going to change
[SPEAKER_04]: things, not just sit there and bitch about
big business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's boring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And big business is going to happen
whether we like it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing that in the cannabis world
regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to change cannabis in the few years
that I have left on this fucking floating
[SPEAKER_04]: rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you think I'm not going to take a
job where someone pays me a decent salary
[SPEAKER_04]: and gives me like a multimillion dollar
budget to fucking grow and make class that
[SPEAKER_04]: the world has never seen before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like it too fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like seeing the passionate side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, I can, I mean, I get offended by
it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's like, you have people that
don't know what the hell they're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, they're spouting that off
as if they're ignorant perspective is
[SPEAKER_04]: like, like one valuable, but like two
supremely valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they think that they're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, dude, go look up the
Dunning-Kruger effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a little bit, you know,
a little bit and think that you know
[SPEAKER_04]: everything, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Try learning a lot and then think that,
you know, you know, anyway, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too much of that in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I'm, I'm all up for raising
everybody up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to, and that's why we do
these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we share perspectives.
[SPEAKER_04]: We teach people because we want you all to
be better so that you all can go and raise
[SPEAKER_04]: the fucking game.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we all raise the game,
the cannabis is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: The products are better.
[SPEAKER_04]: The products are safer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're all dabbing out on the dankest
fucking shit, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's what exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I, I, I, I find it a,
uh, an honor when anybody, anybody uses my
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff because it means that it was good
enough in their eyes to take forward and
[SPEAKER_03]: make better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and the resulting factor that is if
they make something better, better than I
[SPEAKER_03]: made, I don't let that intimidate me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go work with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: They truly are making it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing I don't like is when people
like, they actually hack apart your work
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they tell everybody it's better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they sell it as whatever your
strain is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's that I did give today
contact and he's like, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_04]: I want like, uh, I'm interested in this
kind of high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at your Highland Mexican
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I was like, I want to buy a
hundred seats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, you want to buy a hundred
seats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not excited because he's buying a
hundred seats and it's like, cause he
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to pop a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want him, it was like, it's like,
dude, if you're going to put in a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: grow effort or a hundred seed effort into
improving the line, let me help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I would guide this line and
I would, you know, and I'm going to throw
[SPEAKER_04]: in this line extra so that you've got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that as you're inbreeding this one,
you should put a little bit of this back
[SPEAKER_04]: into it so that, you know, you,
you don't, you don't suffer re-inbreeding
[SPEAKER_04]: depression and they've got the same traits
and it's got some nice flavor stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, in the end you'll be,
you'll be able to, to build better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five pack and then knocking off open
pollination of five seeds to me is an
[SPEAKER_04]: insult because it's like, you're not,
I went to a lot of work to create that
[SPEAKER_04]: population.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you've essentially put through
bottleneck and you're selling it the same
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucked up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please do take my shit, make better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you make better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will support you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take my, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you fucking knock it into crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'm not going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's the way I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I look at them like my kids,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you, you want your babies to go
off to good homes and have happy marriages
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I totally agree on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
Highland Mexican too, since we just
[SPEAKER_04]: brought that up?
[SPEAKER_04]: These were old seeds that came to me
through Radit Legends, actually someone
[SPEAKER_04]: shipped them to him and it was some old
dude that was like, yeah, I, I'm old.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been growing for years and years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I collected these things in the sixties
and seventies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, you know, I don't know
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't have
the ability to do something with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you please give them some of the dead?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we got from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew a whole bunch and found a really
interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put, I had one, I was like,
I'm going to take this one plant and put
[SPEAKER_04]: it in the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, you know, it was like a real
equatorial, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you put it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it gets to like a foot tall and
you're like, Ooh, this thing is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: really stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you cut it down and make four shoots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, this thing, it was like twice as
tall and wide as any other plant in the
[SPEAKER_04]: room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it must've produced like, I don't
know, it wasn't the, they were in like the
[SPEAKER_04]: many thousands of fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was like, you know, probably
eight, 10, because the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: just like the whole, it was these long,
you know, the old kind of like long spear
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers that you'd see in this,
not too thick, but like really long
[SPEAKER_04]: running.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like that just chopped full of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had a nice high effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, I, we were analyzing turps
back then, but I remember I would say that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's probably like a limonene turpentine
or limonene pining plant, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: rare in today's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what was really associated
with a lot of the old days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just nice, but it was nice
classic non like, it was not popular by
[SPEAKER_04]: then.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I released those DJ joint
projects, I put some of those out there
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't think we sold a pack for like
18 months because they were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, they, everybody wanted the
grapefruit blueberry and the mental floss
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the, the parts that were like
getting yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally somebody decided to grow
a couple of those, like in an,
[SPEAKER_04]: in an equatorial climate and ordered some
of those and grew them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were just, I mean, they're,
they have the ugliest phenotype flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like long spindly weird, like,
you know, like buds that have like,
[SPEAKER_04]: they look like they've got like five or
six Fox tails coming out of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just two calories stacked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd look, it would look like a
finger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't look like a hand with a bunch
of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember seeing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take them like just rip off the
calyx and essentially fold the paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were, it was a great,
nice, nice effect in doing those crosses
[SPEAKER_04]: and actually in growing DJ stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I don't, I'm not, I don't have proof
that this is the way it is, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely my very strong feeling is that
all those introspective and like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say up, but like cerebral
kind of highs that you get from THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was largely from running all DJ
stuff through that really expensive lab
[SPEAKER_04]: that we built like in population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of it's in the eight to 12,
percent range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fucking 25% side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low cannabinoid production or what we
would call today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you whack up 30% to like 28,
25, 28, 30% THC, you start to really get
[SPEAKER_04]: that stone kind of lethargic kind of dull
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all the sheen has been taken off of
like a high and you just kind of feel it
[SPEAKER_04]: in your head and you're just like kind of
whacked in stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the THC, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you take a Marinal pill,
you actually feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of feels like somebody thudded you
in the head with something, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like whack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't get that from those 12
percenters or those 10 percenters.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of get a nice floaty buzz,
but it's like, it's enough that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: affected, but you're just kind of in a
different head space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, the clear headed high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and for, you know, like the folks in
Rob's generation, Dave's generation,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's, I'm not saying Rob and Dave in
particular, but like people of that age,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what cannabis was when they were
growing up and what they had access to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was where he didn't come across like
a cookie back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, of course not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd be buzzed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a different head space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that whole generation, not that
whole generation, but the majority of that
[SPEAKER_04]: generation fell in love with that
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indica and 20 plus percent cannabis came
along.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was too much for them because it didn't
do that same thing that they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, and someone was talking
about when the basket's full stuff with
[SPEAKER_04]: THCA, you're kind of right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like, you know, DJ, for example,
like with LSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe the basket's not full with,
you don't want to fill the basket with THC
[SPEAKER_04]: because when you're putting LSD and THC in
it together in moderate amounts,
[SPEAKER_04]: like it's a more pleasant effect,
at least for him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all about perception.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just, you know, it's an
interesting thing because essentially
[SPEAKER_04]: what's happened now is that like the
market was a 10% or a 12% flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good fucking luck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The market, consumers, retailers,
distributors are all going to laugh at
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arguably, there's a whole class of people
out there that would like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like saying, Hey,
we're going to have liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're only going to sell things that are
like 25 and above percent alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get through them all beer,
all wine, all, you know, like coolers and
[SPEAKER_04]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge amount of like alcohol
consumers or the people that like those
[SPEAKER_04]: products that make, they don't want to sit
down with a bottle of whiskey and like do
[SPEAKER_04]: shots or chugs.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a way we're doing the market of the
service and we're doing consumers of the
[SPEAKER_04]: service.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Russell?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't, you know, 20 people would go
to 10%, 12% bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy likes 12% bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a pussy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey man, like not everybody's like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some people want to drink light beer,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like getting baked stoned at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to be able to, if I have to react
to something, I want to be able to react
[SPEAKER_03]: as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: At any point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when people are saying it's like,
you know, not everybody wants that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't want older weed,
older people usually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's true, but maybe like,
you know, we could teach people how to use
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis in a way that some people might
not want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even if you're a teenager,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And dude, I've seen it with friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've seen them friends that like they
start smoking a little bit of weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: then they're like, yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they get into it and they start
smoking more and they're fucking way too
[SPEAKER_04]: fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't like it impacts their life
in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want more people using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they got to smoke something that's
like, you know, half CBD and half THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: or even just most of the CBD with a little
bit of THC in it, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: 5% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think that we should make cannabis
for all people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we run the market that is this way,
it just, it's not a good thing for the,
[SPEAKER_04]: for, it's not a good thing for consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there, there are scientific
studies that show like mass consumption of
[SPEAKER_04]: THC for at least some people is not a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what do we say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, you guys, you don't get to
just, you just, you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit from this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, hey, how about I can make
you something that does benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like that variety that I developed
out of Napro for the, with the
[SPEAKER_04]: beta-carotene and the CBDV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, I was like, that plant had no
recreational potential at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was no fun for anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was going to make a difference in
some three-year-old's life.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his mom is not going to be able to
like give him this shit and he's not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have like 10 seeds in a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That felt really fucking good,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being able to make that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt really, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I can't tell you the way it felt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was more proud of that plant in a way
than any high THC plant that I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: made that like has like a thousand more
people using it or like 10,000 people
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm all about making all types of
cannabis for all types of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because it's the one that like
the majority of people doesn't like,
[SPEAKER_04]: that doesn't mean that it's not an amazing
thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to, we got to make those plants.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is what somebody was saying about
like, Oh, go work for this company,
[SPEAKER_04]: big bad company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to help fucking rich people
get richer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fucking make medicines for
patients or provide plants for,
[SPEAKER_04]: for patients to change their lives.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Change people's lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You either get it or you don't.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody's going to, you know,
you're going to, people are going to look
[SPEAKER_04]: at what I'm saying from another
perspective and say, maybe it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever, all I can tell you is my
truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just want to thank you because,
you know, you guys like you, Red,
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ are all major, major factors in,
in, in the path of my career as a seed
[SPEAKER_03]: maker and the few breedings I've done,
you know, so thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: For, for establishing that, that path,
you know, before me to try to,
[SPEAKER_03]: try to push the boundaries with blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I still love your guys' stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still holds its own to today,
even with all the stuff around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was popular in the market, but I mean,
I grew some of that shit out recently and
[SPEAKER_04]: so everybody's good as a lot of the other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could give a fuck about the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, especially right now, I mean,
the seed markets crashed, cannabis markets
[SPEAKER_03]: crashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like right now, the people that are going
to stick through it are the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: were always going to stick through it,
whether they were making money or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to that,
at least shaking out some of the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's about all the good that's going
to come from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got to leave you with something
like Dave said, you know, Dave Watts and
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam says, it's like, we all stand on our
shoulders in giants, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us, everybody that works with
cannabis, we all got those seeds from
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere, except for three of us who
invented cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to respect the people that we got
things from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, all, all of us in our germ
pleasant, that we have in our hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all came from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe we were refined a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we found some better plants and we
propagated and changed around,
[SPEAKER_04]: but all of us are beholden to the people
that came before us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I want to thank you for stopping by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for eliminating us on the
testing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, that is something I've been very
ignorant in is when it comes to testing
[SPEAKER_03]: and lab testing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't have you back on my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And listen, if there's more questions that
we didn't answer about lab testing,
[SPEAKER_04]: hit up matter, hit up myself, and we'll
address it on IG or we'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or yeah, we'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Push it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything you want to,
you want to say before we go, like as far
[SPEAKER_03]: as where to get your seeds for people in
Canada, anything like that breeders
[SPEAKER_04]: retail, unfortunately, even Canada is a
shit show for seeds because of the
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So breeders retail, if you want our seeds,
reach out to me and I'll hook you up with
[SPEAKER_04]: the breeders retail boys and we'll get you
taken care of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, keep growing seeds, support
people like Matt, support the real ones in
[SPEAKER_04]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we, we got to eat too,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, it's not like I'm choosing
new leather for the Lamborghini,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like really like the seed
industry is not what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in the seed business is,
uh, is hurting in a way that I don't think
[SPEAKER_04]: people really understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely support those dudes that you
can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's asking on cutting folk company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sold them seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bought seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're good folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's throw a shout out to red because
that guy's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red is one of the realest fucking people
I've ever met in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is 20 years and he is one of the most
high integrity individuals that I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: met in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is absolutely a real one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, yeah, he's got a new project out
of, uh, Victoria, British Columbia on the
[SPEAKER_04]: island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they got to grow there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think they're going to make,
hopefully they'll be doing some of your
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah, we got some good things
lined up for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anybody in the industry that's one of
the good guys support them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, we run businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm sure there's some people
driving Lamborghinis, but the truth is
[SPEAKER_04]: that the vast majority of us aren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, we're, you know,
we're just trying to get by like everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely please grow seeds and
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people in the industry that you,
uh, that you like their content and that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you respect their ethic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I got to tell you why it was like,
you know, Matt mentioned that,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, we had a little bit of a fallen out or
rough patch over the patent thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I respect Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we, he came to me, I explained
to him my position on the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he recognized that, you know,
he didn't have the story right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's been like more than.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, forthcoming about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, like, that's all you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, look, we're humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's going to make mistakes,
recognizing the stakes and coming and
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, Hey, I did the wrong thing to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's a, he's a bro for life because of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same here, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I love having you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for stopping by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love to your viewers.
