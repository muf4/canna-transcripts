[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-Dot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, this week's topic, we're going
to talk to our buddy who brings around his
[SPEAKER_02]: own anus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about farming in
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are old buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been in Mendo a few years longer,
comes from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a straight nerd like us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to hear about his adventures
in old Mendoville.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to kick it off, Frank?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, when Matt and I were
discussing like this whole podcast,
[SPEAKER_05]: like kind of the whole theme or purpose of
it really was to sort of like share in a
[SPEAKER_05]: way how we talk amongst each other all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And bring a little bit of that to like the
discourse or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to talk about world
problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: My buddy is one of the people that I've
talked about all kinds of stuff for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We live in the same small little town.
[SPEAKER_05]: We both come from the Midwest,
like Homie said.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually been out here probably four
years longer than me or something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So over a quarter century.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've kind of both seen,
you know, like a lot of the different eras
[SPEAKER_05]: that I think people would consider.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you want to consider them
legendary or just old.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also when we were talking last show
about like a lot of hobbyist breeding and
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of multi-stage breeding and learning
about your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rings is someone that has been,
you know, basically when you first got
[SPEAKER_05]: here in the 90s, that was the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't a clone world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a seed world, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember any popular clones
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I got here, it was all
seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd hear about some indoors here and
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd see little batches of indoor here
and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was a couple of lights,
you know, little bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, so there's an aspect there
where nowadays people view the kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding like that used to be done around
Mendo a lot just to have beans as
[SPEAKER_05]: something sort of mysterious, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, Rings basically never left
that era in the sense of he always he has
[SPEAKER_05]: been breeding kind of for what he likes,
plants he likes, things that interest him.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, regular breeding, no feminized
reversals or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some accidents now and again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just looking at what plants show you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really does tie into what we've been
talking about, but it also ties into like
[SPEAKER_05]: a whole era like pre 215.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and even like after 215 passed,
it probably took what rings like five or
[SPEAKER_05]: eight years for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember like 2002 people feeling like
they actually could lean on 215,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though it passed in whatever year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody said, yeah, nobody thought they
were going to be able to grow in their
[SPEAKER_04]: yard and not get fucked with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were still, you know, keeping it
mellow, keeping it on the down low.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then some friends of mine let it rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just went for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cops came.
[SPEAKER_04]: People tried to rip it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cops got called and the cops left the
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we were, oh, it's a fucking green
light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a major green light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was great though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for the first time we were putting
them out in the sun and not worried and
[SPEAKER_04]: realizing the potential that a plant could
get real big.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chronologically speaking, when you were
in Wisconsin, what you were seeing out
[SPEAKER_02]: there was what type of strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like mostly, were you seeing the Afghanis
proliferate out there still pretty heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: by the time you started?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew a few, some of my older brother's
buddies were growing little gardens in
[SPEAKER_04]: their apartments and whatever,
but I didn't really know any outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: growers there, but you'd see the weed once
in a while come through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was, it seemed like it was pretty
standard kind of Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that climate back there,
you are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us some strain names, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you seeing in Wisconsin strain
wise?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people would say things like
Gany.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basic, not named.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were just stoked if you got something
that wasn't compressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was two kinds of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically there was green Mexican and
brown Mexican.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the level of compression could vary
widely.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best stuff was green and lightly
compressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, some of the worst stuff was
incredibly compressed and very brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And strain names, I mean, you know,
they just, yeah, I think, I think maybe,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe I'm speaking, but barely anyone knew
what I was doing when I lived in Chicago
[SPEAKER_05]: and was growing weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you were in a major populated
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in a rural area.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was, it was all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I remember just people hearing
about my friends and I smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like one of my buddies got busted
drinking and driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he was in the cops, they're like,
we know you and that guy are selling weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I mean, it was like,
we were, we were buying like a quarter
[SPEAKER_04]: ounce once a month and smoking it in one
hitters.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were so far away, but I mean,
we were like dealers in our hometown
[SPEAKER_04]: because of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are asking about various
imports.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't speak for rings, but we both come
from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a little farther North than I was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was rural and I was city,
but I literally saw Mexican.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the Grateful Dead came into town,
there would be some kind bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no Jamaican imports.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no Colombian.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no anything named.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Brown and Green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I got tie stick once and it was
literally tied with a string on a stick.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was very fortunate where I met the,
I like to say the right dirt bag,
[SPEAKER_04]: hippie biker types.
[SPEAKER_04]: That were older and they weren't going to
smoke the worst Brown weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they, they had networks set up somehow
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at least getting like pretty decent
green weed pretty much from the start.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was, I mean, there was no weed
scene in my high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all just drinking and there was a
couple of stoners, but there was no scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: There at that time, it just, it just
wasn't, you know, you moved from Northern
[SPEAKER_05]: Wisconsin to our neck of the woods,
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said, was it, was it 94?
[SPEAKER_04]: 1994, right at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea what I was even getting
into.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just knew one person came out here
within 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was standing next to a pot plant
watching naked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls swimming a pond.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was like walking right into a
wet dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was already very into the hobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already had all the seed catalogs
memorized because I was buying high times
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff and I had grown a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wired up a 175 metal halide.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend rigged one together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a few plants and that I had saved
some seeds from some decent weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we grew them some failed attempts at
growing some, some Mexican seeds or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever outside that just went to shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, it was very minimal
before I moved out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your, what was your impetus for
coming out here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually thought I was going to end up
in like New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of had dreams of desert living when
I left there and I knew one guy here and
[SPEAKER_04]: he was one of my hookups for good weed and
mushrooms, acid, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, he, he left.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw him and he was like, I'm moving out
to California.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're ever there, here's my aunt's
number.
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll know where I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got a hair up my ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I had been all over the
country traveling with my family growing
[SPEAKER_04]: up, but I had never been in California
state lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I just thought I'd swing through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I said, within 20 minutes,
all kinds of just to me, unimaginable
[SPEAKER_04]: things were unfolding in front of my eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, weird hippies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I grew up in a pretty
conservative in a box type of place.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't a lot of various lifestyle
choices and diversity or anything like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like where I'm raised, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This shit is entertaining right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, stories of weird hippies in the
mountains and pagan groups and old
[SPEAKER_04]: communes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, fuck, this is
entertaining right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, NECA girls are a big bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Francis, it would have been the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, but I mean, a lot of times
people, people think, people think when
[SPEAKER_05]: they hear Mendocino County, because now
it's super famous for growing weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that it wasn't famous for growing
weed already.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that most people's like earliest
memory of like Mendo now is like two is
[SPEAKER_05]: the two is the medical era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you had like a leg to stand on and
you could kind of, it was sort of a cat
[SPEAKER_05]: and mouse between things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we both first moved, when we
moved out there, it was a totally
[SPEAKER_05]: different world in the sense of like
everybody that did it kept it pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a, there was a number of people
in town that had successful businesses and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff that did it, but they kept real
quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was done in the hills.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was done tucked away.
[SPEAKER_05]: People didn't want people to know their
money came from wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Showing shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so and I were talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: The successful guys were driving beat up
old trucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would have never known they weren't,
there was no flash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we were, we were talking just the
other day about it and there'd be guys
[SPEAKER_05]: that like were worth a lot of money and
their truck would be old and a little
[SPEAKER_05]: rusted and have a few dents or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like they pop the hood and the
whole thing is chrome and super cherry
[SPEAKER_05]: souped up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a souped up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they've got great suspensions.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got all this nice shit,
but it's like they could drive through our
[SPEAKER_05]: crap little town and look normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because nobody wanted to stand out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wanted to get targeted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then even when 215, even when 215
passed, um, it took, like he said,
[SPEAKER_05]: it took a number of years for people to
get a sense of what you could do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, most of the people I learned
from and were, was exposed to,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were old.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were older already then and had been
doing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they, they, they weren't, they didn't
even have, they didn't even have a fancy
[SPEAKER_04]: engine in their truck.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they were just chill.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just glad to, to be living up in
the mountains and having a home and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and be hanging out and being more
comfortable than a person working at one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the local businesses or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were, they were living good,
eating good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to realize too that Mendo was pretty
famous for being a huge logging community,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that had sort of fallen apart in the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I would classify it as pretty poor
when I first arrived.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very poor, very poor, very run down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like even having money was unusual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like everybody that had money was from
some established, well-known family that
[SPEAKER_05]: owned businesses in town.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, there was no, there was
hardly even any weed around here,
[SPEAKER_04]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even though it was Mendo and
whatever, it would run out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you were holding something decent,
you were the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there really wasn't a lot then.
No.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, if you had two or three patches in
the woods and you got away with one of
[SPEAKER_05]: them and you got 30 pounds, you were like
loaded down.
[SPEAKER_05]: With cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a lot of loot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had whatever you needed that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: 120,000 bucks in 94 would have been,
you know, that's like, that'd be like
[SPEAKER_04]: having 500,000 bucks now practically the
way the prices were at that time for land
[SPEAKER_04]: and homes and stuff like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people, but yet they couldn't show
it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was kind of, you didn't really know
who was holding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Natsuo and I were talking the
other day and he met some guy that had
[SPEAKER_04]: copious amounts and he was living in a
shack in walking around in his underwear
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's actually like, I was telling
him it's probably like the wealthiest
[SPEAKER_05]: person in weed I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm not even exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew exactly who he was talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the wealthiest person I think I've
ever met in weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had a bunch of huge scenes that I
don't want to describe, but he,
[SPEAKER_05]: he had this like visqueen like black and
white poly shack that like stretched like
[SPEAKER_05]: in between the trees with rope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had a really nice like teak wooden
table in this thing and he slept in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he walked around like he had a huge
like multi pack of tidy whiteys and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: hot up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he would walk around in his tidy
whiteys and his boots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he lived in a visqueen shack up on the
rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he literally like, I mean,
he, and he sold like unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he made so much money,
you know, but it was just, that was his
[SPEAKER_05]: life.
[SPEAKER_05]: He ran various things.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't leave the hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: He, and it was just hot and he didn't like
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he walked around and, you know,
it almost think you'd almost think that
[SPEAKER_05]: like he escaped from like a mental
institution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I can't blame the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walk around like that in my house and
I'm not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still, I'm carrying the torch too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, in a way it's like,
if you busted that guy, like he had
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, he might own 15
properties and have like underground grows
[SPEAKER_05]: and generators and this and that and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, you know, it's like,
if they came and tried to get him,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like, he didn't have sports cars.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't have a nice big house.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't have boats.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't have anything that they could
find.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, and that's, that's kind of like what
I was thinking about when, when you were
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about that rings was like the real
old-timers around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just liked to live up here and they
liked having enough money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they weren't poor and they didn't
acquire.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd meet a lot of like popular kids and
they traveled the world and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they weren't flashing anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that was like their luxury.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like their parents would help them travel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was like a, that was more like
flashing wealth and Mendo kind of became
[SPEAKER_05]: more of a two 15 era thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you had a leg to stand on with the,
with your, your legitimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unthinkable to flash in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I would put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unthinkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only know a few people that were
probably dumb enough to flash in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties and they ran a some kind of
Hollywood mansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were bringing actors in and out to
show them their little tiny shithole girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of them went to jail and had
Woody Harrelson bail him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only people I could think of
that were dumb enough to flash like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like bring people into a mansion with
grows and yeah, one guy before I even
[SPEAKER_04]: moved here, I mean, they've had
documentaries about that guy and I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: remember his name.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was one of the biggest importers in the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was bringing everything in through the
Bay and he built on Robinson Creek road.
[SPEAKER_04]: He built this big mansion with like watch
towers on it and hidden rooms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that happened before I got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was rural.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like his house was pretty hidden,
but it was pretty extravagant and he went
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: He went down big and he's out now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually just bought that mansion back
from this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew who owned it, but there was,
there was a, um, maybe people should know
[SPEAKER_05]: that that like, so when I first moved out
here, I had my, my, I literally had like,
[SPEAKER_05]: just like rings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one friend that lived a little North
Ukiah and that was like sort of my landing
[SPEAKER_05]: spot where he got me situated in the
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I thought it was going to be a
bunch of like grateful dead hippies,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and back to the landers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, it was like, I was from the city
and it was all these country people that
[SPEAKER_05]: lived clean and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got here and there was, there was
some hippies, but there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: weirdos.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of rednecks.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of poverty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting a person I like, like you,
that just seemed mellow and like nice and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff was kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a rough crowd.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the hippie side of it was pretty
mellow, but I mean, most of it was pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: outlaws.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as far as quantities went,
those, those were people way out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: boonies and they had guns and they were,
you know, I mean, tails of shooting at
[SPEAKER_04]: helicopters and there was a lot of rough
people out in the boonies growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always been a way where weed
allowed a certain amount of people that
[SPEAKER_05]: have like a lot of fucking mental illness,
anger management and various other ticks
[SPEAKER_05]: to like survive well, but not have to
like, like smooth those issues out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people were suspicious,
you know, there's aspects of, of that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, in the sense of it was just very
eyeopening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, like once, once logging left,
this place was poor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so not only weed, people think it was
a weed Mecca before the Mexicans took it
[SPEAKER_05]: over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Northern California was also like
where lots of little batches of meth got
[SPEAKER_05]: cooked.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a whole underbelly of,
of meth people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a little bit of a blending
of the two communities, but not always,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, but you know, there was there,
there was various motorcycle groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was all kinds of weirdos that own
land in the Hills.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, growing a lot of weed was always a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember people way back then
talking about like hiring meth heads,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause they would work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just keep, keep them high.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll dig 200 holes in the woods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then still all your shit when you're
not looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe not if you had a,
I mean, people did things like tied
[SPEAKER_04]: mountain lions in the middle of their
patch and chained them up to trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there was that checks out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the stories, the deep well of
bizarre stories in this part of the world
[SPEAKER_04]: is it's troubling, funny, you know,
very, a lot of disturbing stories,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's, I mean, actually it's,
it hasn't been very violent around here
[SPEAKER_04]: the last few years, the murders,
the partners shooting each other seems
[SPEAKER_04]: like it's a really tamed down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally has, you know, I mean,
you know, there, there was an aspect where
[SPEAKER_05]: there's someone even older than us that I
hope to be able to bring on soon that can
[SPEAKER_05]: speak of like the eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: But by the time rings and I got here,
you know, camp had been sort of hammering
[SPEAKER_05]: the County for a good 12, 15 years,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was a lot of back and
forth between that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of sort of secret society,
like people really kept to eat to
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really hard to get accepted into
certain groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very, it was a little paranoid at a
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on top of that, you know,
let's face it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so you're getting four or $5,000 a
pound for your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have a whole bunch of money and
it's dark and it's cold and it's Mendo and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're bored and it's winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there was all kinds of scandalous,
you know, substance use, which was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of which had negative
connotations for whole little groups of
[SPEAKER_05]: people, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: On, on some of the old growers I met when
I moved out here, they're like in the
[SPEAKER_04]: seventies or whatever late early eighties,
they'd be like, things started getting
[SPEAKER_04]: fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd be like, that's when people started
trading their weed for Coke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it became trading it for meth,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just started getting funky,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first guys I worked with told
me basically that exact story that when
[SPEAKER_05]: you get 4,500 or 5,000 a pound for
anything that you grow, that's decent,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, you get bored in the winter and
then the one guy gets a kilo of cocaine or
[SPEAKER_05]: something, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes, and he goes, then the problem
is, is five years later, everyone's
[SPEAKER_05]: cheating on everyone else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people are messed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are this, people are that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you got in trouble back then,
you either went to jail for two or three
[SPEAKER_05]: or four years usually, or you had to narc
on your friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: There really wasn't a defense,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's an aspect there of like,
you know, I mean, there's, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: there was, you know, there was,
there was opiates.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was every problem you could imagine
existed on some scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't that many people,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't like it, but there was,
there was partiers of all kinds and there
[SPEAKER_05]: was people that were definitely into a
bunch of bad things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, weed was a way to survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like, maybe on a positive note,
before we get too dark on that level,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it does set the stage because,
I mean, I'll tell a very quick story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember like, I was hiking with friends
and we were up on this majestic trail and
[SPEAKER_05]: I was still pretty like new from,
from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even just hills excited me,
you know, like big expansive trees and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, Oh, I'm tripping.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like looking out over this thing
and it's all beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked down and there's like dozens
of cars that people, it was like a spot
[SPEAKER_05]: that people drove up to and just to get
rid of their trash, they would push their
[SPEAKER_05]: car off the ledge and it would just roll
down the hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and like the hills were littered
with this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was amazed when I moved out here,
like every time you found out beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: turnoff to stop and look at the scenery,
there'd be like just trash below you every
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of the country people would
just take their trash and drive and be
[SPEAKER_05]: going down the road at night and just bags
of trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would just throw out their vehicle
off, off the hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people, so I was shocked because I
thought it was going to come up coming
[SPEAKER_05]: from the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I'm going to come to this
clean, pristine, place, weed growing
[SPEAKER_05]: hippies, redwoods, the organic food,
organic food, all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was all there in bits and pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was all this other stuff that I
had never seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it makes sense because,
you know, that, that stuff really started
[SPEAKER_05]: stopping when the weed money really
started changing the game to the point
[SPEAKER_05]: where there wasn't so much poverty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the houses that we bought or got
into or the land was very cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of it was very, very cheap.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we could do a little run down.
[SPEAKER_05]: People would do little indoors or do
outdoors and they would end up fixing the
[SPEAKER_05]: bathroom, fixing the roof, putting on a
deck, just taking like a falling down
[SPEAKER_05]: fifties Farmhouse that they bought on a
handshake deal and every weed crop
[SPEAKER_05]: improving it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many funky houses out in the country
around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, now there are a lot of them are
all fixed up and nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it had 20 years of, of money coming
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if they're shitty still, they're
worth a ton of money at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we could talk about for a second
just to go from the ambiance of the area
[SPEAKER_05]: to what were the strains that you were
seeing when you first came out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then obviously, just so people know,
there wasn't a lot of names back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of individual families and friends
had different seed lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you could get a cockamamie story out
of a few of them about what had happened
[SPEAKER_05]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everyone grew from seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people got seeds from their friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then every two or three years or
something, they'd be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: I need some more seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I better take some of these males in the
bushes and pollinate some of my females so
[SPEAKER_05]: I have fresh stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like a lot of the ranches around
here, there'd be a couple of people that
[SPEAKER_04]: were into making seeds and everybody else
just got seeds from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty common, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some people that were just into
that side of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody else would just go to them,
buy starts from them or get seeds from
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty common, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was still nerds back then before we
came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just harder to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Matt and I have had a lot of
experience, too, with even people that we
[SPEAKER_05]: would consider to be nerds today.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ask them about specifics of when they
were young and they just don't have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just don't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned out good or it didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if it turned out bad,
it was still worth the same obnoxious
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still all sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one of the good things is it
led to a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want people to know before we
start chatting about this that lineage was
[SPEAKER_05]: often hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some like poorly sourced legends
about a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everyone that was growing weed had
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a lot of different hill
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of different neighborhoods
that had different seeds, because like
[SPEAKER_05]: Ring said, there'd be one or two guys that
was like the neighborhood nerd.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would do breeding and then the
friends would get seeds from them and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there was just a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people just didn't even
realize they could keep a male and make
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't wasn't that hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they just they just thought it
was taboo to even have a male anywhere
[SPEAKER_04]: around, even though they could have sold
their seeded shit for big bucks even back
[SPEAKER_04]: then, too, as long as it was green and
trim decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everything, it's just that's
just the way it was then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can't say like, I mean,
that's why like with being into the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic side, it was like when you saw
something good, it wasn't all the it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't even that often.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so if I got something good,
I would be like, where'd you get this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care where these are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll drive anywhere to get these seeds,
you know, just to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might go you might drive up to Oregon
to get some seeds and come back and pop
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all herms.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't you didn't know, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, most people didn't keep most
people didn't keep clones over the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like people would pop a certain
amount of seeds in spring and go through a
[SPEAKER_05]: process of sexing them and try to figure
out how many they thought they could get
[SPEAKER_05]: away with and then plant females where
they had to put them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even I have a buddy who's who was
telling me like even some of the first
[SPEAKER_05]: like hundred lighters he worked at in
Southern Humble, right, indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like literally like they made
beds on the floor and they planted seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: and they went in and they cut the males
off at the base.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because it wasn't it wasn't a clone
world yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what they knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you hear a few stories like like
that orange thing you had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being like an old clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was that was that's kind of
unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about some of your first breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear about some of these
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Raines, what's what's some of the
first stuff you worked with when you were
[SPEAKER_02]: actually like like I have a fucking goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to I want to end up with XYZ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's some of the first stuff you
worked with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was just looking at things like
in the way they appeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, at that time I was young and
and, you know, dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance and shiny was pretty desirable,
you know, and it's funny to think back of
[SPEAKER_04]: how sometimes you'd see something great
and you'd be like, oh, that stinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would never grow that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, does it smell good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you didn't want you didn't want
your shit found.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was more about just like finding
something that would come in before the
[SPEAKER_04]: weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was chunky and decent to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we didn't want sour diesel buds
at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even, you know, we didn't want to do that
kind of trimming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really about just making
something that was decent to work with,
[SPEAKER_04]: not super needy to like you're sticking
shit way up in the mountains and visiting
[SPEAKER_04]: it here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeping a close, lengthy eye on
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you you didn't want something that like
I remember the first time I grew like a
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: One type of thing we put up in the hills
every time we went up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wanted shit, you know,
stuff we had going would be dark green and
[SPEAKER_04]: happy with virtually nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would do all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the plants weren't big.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't need a lot because we weren't
growing these monsters.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were quarter pounders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under the in the bushes, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they didn't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would just bring a bag of back one up
in the hills and some water holding
[SPEAKER_04]: crystals and and hope that things went all
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, things could be a dream,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Water crystals used to be huge because you
weren't able to get to your because most
[SPEAKER_05]: people hiked into their site and it was
far enough away from your house or it was
[SPEAKER_04]: on a safety net because if you only went
once a week in the your little water line,
[SPEAKER_04]: some an animal fucked it up or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they went six days without water in
one hundred and five degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've said this before,
but there's a there's a big like ag store,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you'd call it a garden store in
Willets in Mendo called Spare Time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they used to have used to walk into
their front door and they would have them,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they would have a six foot tall
stack of cases of camo spray paint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what he was just saying is if you
use soft poly, the rats, the wood rats,
[SPEAKER_05]: various other critters, they'd smell the
water and it's so dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd come and they chew through your
poly to get fucking hate rats together to
[SPEAKER_05]: get water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden your plants
aren't getting wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so people would use some people
would use PVC, but then it was white.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you needed to spray paint it to make it
look like the ground cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before you put it together, because
otherwise, like, you know, and then they
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't they could smell it, but they
couldn't chew through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing how how camp was back then,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they would find like they took their
time and scan the hills so closely they
[SPEAKER_04]: would find like a few little plants in the
bushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd take their time and just work
areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember diving in the bushes when I
first moved.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh, the government is trying to find
people like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're diving in the bushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that was cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty punk rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's an aspect to people don't
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why like everybody take a shot
every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so says aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: People would hide them in the trees like
on little on on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never did that, but I had friends who
would put them on on, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: raise platforms in the trees because the
the helicopters, they'd be looking at a
[SPEAKER_05]: certain line and they a lot of times their
eyes would miss it or they'd put them
[SPEAKER_05]: along the line of a tree line or
manzanitas.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd hollow out branches and you'd still
leave the top cover and hopefully they
[SPEAKER_05]: would make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were after it so hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you really had to be careful and
then you would take different ways to get
[SPEAKER_05]: to your spot often.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's not like you drove your vehicle
there or you drove your ATV or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't even want to walk the same
pathway because they'd see the path from
[SPEAKER_05]: the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you would take different routes to get
there and get in and get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you walk on the animal trails
really carefully to not make them look
[SPEAKER_04]: weird from the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was fun to try to camouflage
things and and it was fun to be a little
[SPEAKER_04]: ninja.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we weren't even doing much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just worth something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, we were just into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we were into the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to have some.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were willing to hike up mountains to
get a very little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was fucking nuts,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that kind of heart trauma,
like going up and watching like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, eight of your big fucking rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you plant one for these plant one for
pigs and plant one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's the theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was so dramatic.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was even in spring when you're like
setting it all up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you're digging your holes or
you're bringing in your if you're not if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not using the right the earth
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you had to hike in your,
you know, your your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to bring in your amendments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could feed even if you were using
native earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hard to feed on nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Run your water lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe drill a spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're crawling in the bushes,
carving out little spaces for your
[SPEAKER_05]: patches.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole drill is spring like people my
age, like from California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even get what the fuck that
means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drill a fucking spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Put in a spring box.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the spring collects water in the spring
box and then run piping from that box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes hundreds of yards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you're downhill,
you would try to find water witching shit
[SPEAKER_02]: to find the springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there was little springs on
properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would you would like build a box and
then just rig up a pipe going out the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would collect a little bit and just
slowly trickle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we had them feeding little tanks
or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because you needed springs because you
it's not like you could put in a well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even if you had solar or something
like that, they'd see it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't even like I just don't get how
people found springs out in fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how did you find these things under
the ground for wet spots?
[SPEAKER_04]: I met people that knew where the springs
were, you know, or on properties where
[SPEAKER_04]: there was like little hidden parts of the
property that had a little water source.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically a spring box is just digging
a hole big enough to put a certain size
[SPEAKER_05]: like manmade box in there that's going to
collect the water and let it build up to a
[SPEAKER_05]: usable amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can drain it out one end and
the gravity feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gravity feed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the most part.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's upstarted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a siphon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and if you had a low,
low grade to somewhere, it was tricky to
[SPEAKER_04]: get the bubbles out of those lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember working on that very hard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of hiking back and forth to see if it
worked now or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there ever turf floors over springs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yes, there was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about that when when two
fifteen happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of you don't hear this
talked about very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all these water sources in the
mountains, people kind of had them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of their turf.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they had those spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when two fifteen happened,
the cartels came with guns and pretty much
[SPEAKER_04]: kicked everybody off their spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it but two fifteen was allowing
all the people that had those spots to do
[SPEAKER_04]: it right in their fucking yard then.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like a little transfer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of territories or whatever got out of the
woods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people used to there used to be a
thing where, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: people would have arguments over how far
away the patch should be from your home so
[SPEAKER_05]: that if they did camp it, they would just
take the patch and not mess with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there would be arguments about how
much you should hike and how far away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's not like it was just like off
in the bushes, you know, 100 yards from
[SPEAKER_05]: your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these things you'd hike into or
hike up to, and it would be a good
[SPEAKER_05]: distance away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why the little like the little
trails were so like you really had to
[SPEAKER_04]: think about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they saw a trail, they'd just walk
right to it and there would be,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you had to really ninja that
stuff and be careful, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's like I remember like a lot
of times, especially when I was hiking up
[SPEAKER_05]: like dry amendments or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the spring, I would just want to puke
because you're like going uphill and
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got like a 50 pound thing of food
on your back and you're hiking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, you get to midsummer
and it doesn't even feel like anything
[SPEAKER_05]: because you're in shape and you've done it
for months.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the beginning, you would.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was as a young buck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be like, oh, my God, this is fucking
rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So another thing that's kind of funny that
people should know is that for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like you use something like like fish
meal or bone meal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or blood meal or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden, you realize
like, oh, that attracts bears.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and bears are some kind of big
animal comes in looking for what smells
[SPEAKER_05]: because you've got composting fish meal or
composting crab meal or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a big ass bear starts to dig in
your soil and ruins your patch because you
[SPEAKER_05]: use the wrong kind of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the people I learned from
right away was it was like backwash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right away because they were
hippies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then a lot of people who didn't care
about that kind of stuff, they use those
[SPEAKER_04]: little Osmocote pellets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Balls and they would just put those in
there and that would be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: All they had to do was just add water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Time release.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was some people that once
you I mean, and I'll say this,
[SPEAKER_05]: too, there was people that had established
spots that they were able to do small
[SPEAKER_05]: patches in year after year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so some of those people had some
really nice soils, some really nice holes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They amended them well every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like an active organic
situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there was some better pot that came
out of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in the setting it up sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water quality really affected the weed
back then, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: People weren't using city water,
treated water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like mountain water,
you know, and just like any other living
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, the quality of water is it makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it had minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had little bits of stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I learned, too, that the old
timers always taught me that pot was like
[SPEAKER_05]: a lateral root growth plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they would always say like in the
bushes, it's better to dig like an 18 inch
[SPEAKER_05]: or a two foot deep hole that was wide
rather than one that was deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're like the plant's going
to want to go wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll get more weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like make a shallow depression and fill
it in rather than digging like a,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was people that would dig
like four or five, six foot deep holes,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that would have been me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't use that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you're such, it's such a bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like crawling in the manzanitas
with like a shovel that can strap to your
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're underneath there and
you're just like chomping at the,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, six feet with a tiny little,
and then you got to like, I was young at
[SPEAKER_04]: that stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because nothing fucking mattered.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got it done or whatever,
but it wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you had to remove this,
the, you know, like, because a lot of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of Mendo is red clay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we have like a ton of black,
loamy, deep, rich earth that you can just
[SPEAKER_05]: like plant into.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like mountainous and rocky and
clay-like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you definitely had to add some
stuff to it and amend it if you wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you could just like dig a
hole and plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into strains guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to hear about the strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's always so funny because without
clones to reference people, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just telling them about a ghost,
you know, like a little bit, a little bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, but I had a moment today where I
was harvesting some volunteer accidental
[SPEAKER_04]: thing that popped up in my yard and,
uh, the rain got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the only early thing I had in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had some big soft colas on it and the
rain kind of started getting to them a
[SPEAKER_04]: little botrytis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm smelling the piece I picked a few
days ago and I'm smelling it and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_04]: this smells just like Afghans 30 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what the volunteer was
from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, uh, some cookie Kush crap crossed
with my blue dynamite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super lemon OG crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I had one male last year,
so it had to be from that male.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can dig some blue dynamite crap over
cookie Kush shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people hate cookies and I don't
like what it stands for either,
[SPEAKER_04]: but ultimately if it's gassy and it has a
good, I mean, if it's gassy, it's still
[SPEAKER_04]: decent smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stay high off it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I can't stay high off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has no legs for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it's strong and some of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes I, when I first found
cookies like forum and animal and tried
[SPEAKER_04]: those things, I actually appreciated not
being still fucking, I don't need to get
[SPEAKER_04]: sledgehammer fucking freaked out,
stoned all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I want to, but I mean,
I was high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wasn't just because I'm not
tripping the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not high, you know, not everything has
to have me fucking, just the forum forum
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get, I get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a good high for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's just like, yeah,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got to go pick your kid up from
school in a half an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I talk about this with rings quite a
bit, actually where like I'll smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My headband, like the LA and I'll go into
town stupidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've done this hundreds of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: To myself over the years, I'll get all
baked on some of the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll go into town and I'll be standing
in line at this weird little store.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be like the Twilight zone in
line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, why am I here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing I will say about cookies is
that I don't like cookies that much
[SPEAKER_05]: either.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but two things about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is that was, since we were just
talking about the gorilla era,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have flipped out to have
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cookies came out in the wrong era.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we would have had that shit in the
gorilla era because cookies requires low
[SPEAKER_05]: light.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super dense, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to get that big to weigh a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't like food.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't like sunlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could have put it in a deep shade,
not fed it very much and just loaded
[SPEAKER_05]: Manzanita patches with cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would have come in early enough to
not mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it would have been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the things people are growing
when I moved out here did not come in
[SPEAKER_04]: early.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody grew specifically for early.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kind of my own like mission was
to create something like early that was
[SPEAKER_04]: strong and looked good and decent to work
with and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot, when I moved out here,
I was hanging out on a mountain and people
[SPEAKER_04]: were bringing in fucking baseball colas
out of the rain at the end of October.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people I learned from were really
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They knew how to let things get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't going to freak out and pull
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They taught me a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got lucky and met people that
really were into it and cared about it and
[SPEAKER_04]: were also down to take their time to show
me some stuff and tell me why they did
[SPEAKER_04]: this or why they didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of just hill weed that had
a good amount of sativa in it of all kinds
[SPEAKER_05]: back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of weed that didn't finish
until, say, late October to early
[SPEAKER_05]: November.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it resisted the rain pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mendo, most falls, there's a lot of
warm, dry fall in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might rain for two or three days and
then be sunny for weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a lot of sativa weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because all the weeds sold,
there wasn't like, I think what started
[SPEAKER_05]: with the purple craze and then the various
things is everyone started getting the
[SPEAKER_05]: same cuttings and blending them.
[SPEAKER_05]: This era is the total opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All kinds of random, unique weed,
some of it pretty midsy, but all kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: different stuff just floated around
because all weeds sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every smell you can imagine today was
already there back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you took the time to see as much as
possible, which I was into, if people were
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I was just into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, oh, somebody's got some
different shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go and look through it and ask them
questions if I like some.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember smelling super intense
cherry back then, super intense lime,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the earthy, skunky, Afghani smells,
and just kind of a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: everything and all different leafs.
[SPEAKER_04]: All different kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about some of the most unique shit
that you remember seeing during your early
[SPEAKER_02]: days there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's some of the most, not necessarily
by name, but describe it if you can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I keep on thinking about this,
some stuff that my friends grew it
[SPEAKER_04]: actually down in the Watsonville and a
girlfriend down there that was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: college.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was down there a lot when they were
doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the guys was ex-military.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had friends up in Humboldt and they had
some little gorilla thing in a canyon in
[SPEAKER_04]: Watsonville.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it was done, he brought us all
this stuff and it was just like sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was, maybe it was kind of
purple, but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys knew how to cure things
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were really into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took their time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They cared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we called it Gray Bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gray Bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those two sativa strains was called
Golden Lion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody up in Humboldt would recognize
that name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden Lion?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Golden Lion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just figured it was from some Rasta
crew up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember that Gray Bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends and I smoking it and like not
even talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we just left our fucking bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the most memorable things too,
Thai Afghans from Spiroc.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the first things I saw that just
had everything, beauty, smell,
[SPEAKER_04]: really wild highs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember my buddy would take his
scissors, hash and it looked like what we
[SPEAKER_04]: called monkey's blood opium.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like translucent red.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember smoking that and sitting on
the ground and just holding the ground,
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting to come just to get my bearings.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those Thai Afghans blew me away.
[SPEAKER_04]: These characters were so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lowbird, a guy who called himself Lowbird,
a weird jungle monkey from Hawaii growing
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawaiian sativas in the like 94.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had great stories of Swazis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said all of him and the old heads,
they liked Swazis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like the gold in Hawaii in like
the early 90s or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I never got to see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grew some Hawaiian sativa seeds here
and would bring the plants in every night
[SPEAKER_04]: because they weren't gonna get done until,
I think he harvested them at Christmas.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were fucking great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had really floral, sweet smells,
really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them had really nice little shade
of purple in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them stayed green no matter how
cold it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that too is like because weed
was so valuable then, it was a lot easier
[SPEAKER_05]: to dry and handle things.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wanted to in a really nice way
because there wasn't so much of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it wasn't some overwhelming amount of
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could treat it nicer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that made a difference too.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things maybe we should note is
that when you get pounds or you'd see
[SPEAKER_05]: pounds, most of them were all mixed phenos
because they weren't from clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you would get, they would be pounds and
they would be all the same line but they
[SPEAKER_05]: would trim it up and they would blend it
up and you'd be looking at this and this
[SPEAKER_05]: would smell like that and this would smell
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'd be like, oh wait,
what is that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you start digging in the bag
looking for weed that looks like that and
[SPEAKER_05]: picking out and trying to gather yourself
a little pile.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like that one right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always joked how people would,
there'd be like an overripe purple bud in
[SPEAKER_04]: a mixed bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: That had no resin on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just smelled like garbage because it was
way overripe and somebody would see a
[SPEAKER_04]: pound and they'd focus in on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be like, look at that purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd just laugh because it was garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would probably be me.
[SPEAKER_05]: A young me would be doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's an aspect too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some people would be like,
oh, some of these pounds are kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: midsy, but these plants are really
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to take a few ounces and
put them into the top of each of these
[SPEAKER_05]: pounds so that when people open the bag,
there's like a nice selection and it makes
[SPEAKER_05]: them think that the whole bag is like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really it's like, these are nice and
the rest of them are just okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it all went because people wanted good
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have any options to get better
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't getting rejected.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just dried yourself stuff nice,
kept it green, got it dry enough to where
[SPEAKER_04]: it wouldn't turn yellow right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your shit was golden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was really appreciated by
people, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that one time I grew that skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny because people were like,
this shit is weak and they were just
bummed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have money and they were
spending 50 bucks on an eighth even here
[SPEAKER_04]: in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they took a smoke, they would ration
shit out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were taking a couple of hits of
something and not getting tore back,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were kind of bummed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and also one thing that I don't know
if a lot of people realize, seed prices
[SPEAKER_02]: probably have, instead of with flation
risen, have maybe dropped now compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: what they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've always been pretty, especially
Sensi, they've always been pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive for the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've dropped massively because if you
think about the purchasing power of what
[SPEAKER_05]: that, the seed cost hasn't changed all
that that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, obviously there's some people
that have some hype that try to counter
[SPEAKER_05]: inflation or whatever, but for me- I
couldn't imagine buying seeds from Europe
[SPEAKER_04]: back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my older brother's friends went to
Europe and brought back seeds in the 80s
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They lived in metro areas, Minneapolis,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have their little closet grows
of about 400 or a couple of 400s or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had that Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I moved out here, I was just
like, man, it didn't seem like that Dutch
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff even mattered out here, but it did
everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most of the Dutch stuff was
imported from either California,
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington or the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't really have a need to go to
the Dutch to get a fucked up version of
[SPEAKER_02]: what was already there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never heard people say like,
oh, we put Northern Lights in this or we
[SPEAKER_04]: put Skunk One in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mostly older stuff and it really
didn't have much, which I appreciated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already was a total nerd, a high times
nerd.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew all those strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lusted at wanting to try them and stuff,
but I was able to try some Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_04]: and Skunk Northern Lights mixes that my
brother's friends had made and one of
[SPEAKER_04]: their friends grew G13 clones in the early
90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were actually the first crew I knew
that did clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kept stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had a great plant, they kept it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were into their gardening.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually this crew from before I
even moved out to Mendo from Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_05]: that had this, they called it Blueberry
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to get it in 93, 94, 95,
96.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never was able to get a clone of it out
in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had little, in Madison and some of
these rural areas outside of Madison,
[SPEAKER_05]: they would have these little four and six
lighters and they would all grow this
[SPEAKER_05]: Blueberry Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they called it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really attractive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what it was related to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never grew it myself, but I got buds of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's interesting about that too is that
when you found somebody that was
[SPEAKER_05]: intelligent in the sense that they cared
about the, intelligent is the wrong word,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, when they cared about lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when they were fucking autistic
nerds like us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, when they cared about lineage,
not intelligence, but just like a weed
[SPEAKER_05]: nerdism to like, they'd tell you something
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, it's a Mexican with a Swazi or
it's a Colombian Mex with some Afghan that
[SPEAKER_05]: we, but most of it was the name of the
closest little mountain or town that it
[SPEAKER_05]: came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first moved here, there was so much
weed that was like, oh, this is from White
[SPEAKER_05]: Thorn.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from the Hills above Coppola.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some Sherwood Road.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some Long Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some, you know, some Alder Point
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just named kind of by the
little town or the little area or the
[SPEAKER_05]: little hills that it came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: More than anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wanted their names associated with
anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when I brought out the mouse,
the Maui because I, you know, I brought
[SPEAKER_05]: out the Maui and the crystal chunk to
California because from Chicago,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was all we knew was like,
the only reason why you started Seeds was
[SPEAKER_05]: to find a killer clone and then you use
the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we were all indoor and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and so I came here and
clones, like he said, clones were rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were shocked that I was like
running rooms of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keepers were just plants that were kept
because nobody kept shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have kept anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you had those, I mean, there just
wasn't many clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I always think of your Maui,
Afgu.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the Afgu up here, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was early and it looked like indoor
because it was so resinous and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it came in at a decent time
outdoors too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had, it has amazing turps too,
unless you get sick of it because pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much everything with Afgu smells like Afgu
and you can't get sick of it if that's all
[SPEAKER_02]: you're smelling like that cantaloupe-y
weird mango-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a Northern Lights blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that went around here that
smelled, it either was the same or it
[SPEAKER_04]: smelled very similar early on back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was, that was sort of like when
you, when you did a bunch of outdoor seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff like that, that was my first
experience with like, oh wow, there really
[SPEAKER_05]: are dominant traits, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember some of my first readings
thinking that I could breed away from
[SPEAKER_05]: certain things I wasn't fond of and breed
towards other things I liked more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sometimes that worked really well
and I pat myself on the back and sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: that trait was just ingrained and I was
like, oh, I can't get rid of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just part of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you were saying things like Afgu
smell like Afgu or turpentoline or
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there was things where you're like,
oh, I can't get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember getting really sick of Afgu
pounds because I was bored.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought all clones were like great
to see and maybe they were great to smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: here and there, but as far as the mission
I was on, all clones were boring unless
[SPEAKER_04]: you just made seeds with them and then the
seeds you grew out of them were fun,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just wasn't a clone guy ever,
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved sour so much that I kept that for
a long time and a lot of times having
[SPEAKER_04]: other friends hold it at times or this or
that, I kept it around because it was just
[SPEAKER_04]: like a daily driver to me, like just
something I like smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd ask you the top three favorite
strains, but I'm not sure I can get any
[SPEAKER_02]: strain names out of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can actually talk to him about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know all the clones,
you know, I always hung out with people
[SPEAKER_04]: that grew the clones and enjoyed them and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as far as like things that are
identifiable, there certainly is some
[SPEAKER_04]: faith.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not even identifiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mean like top three favorite
smokes, not even necessarily strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: but smokes, events, what it smelled like,
tasted like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really like, there's strain
names, just identifiable stuff and we use
[SPEAKER_02]: that so other people know exactly what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can transcend that just by talking
about what it smelled like, tastes like,
[SPEAKER_02]: the highs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I could interject just really quick
though, is that before we get away from
[SPEAKER_05]: it, which is there was two sour diesels I
saw early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is the one that I still have,
which I've talked about before,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then there was this other one that
Rings was much more familiar with that
[SPEAKER_05]: exists that took longer, was more
feathery, hermed more, was more delicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could talk about that for a minute
because the sour that I ended up keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: was one of two that I saw and the one that
he had was much different, but it was
[SPEAKER_05]: spread around back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was significantly different in
growth pattern and it had a similar nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was definitely similar, but it was very
different in growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we considered it to be like pine
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the whole sour thing was just
crazy how it just took off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the first time I got it actually
was from a guy, Mean Gene knows too,
[SPEAKER_04]: he grew up near him.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy gave it to me and I was like,
this shit is ugly because still at that
[SPEAKER_04]: time, everybody basically wanted something
dense, round, with a lot of resin on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my buddy handed me the sour and I was
just like, fuck, this shit's all feathery
[SPEAKER_04]: as peach colored hairs on it and just
looked weird to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as soon as we smoked it, it was just
like, I remember looking at it and just
[SPEAKER_04]: being, wow, this is going past what the
norm is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the first commercial thing that
didn't look like everything people wanted
[SPEAKER_04]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dense, round, crisply, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just such good smoke, it would make
people forget about those other things
[SPEAKER_04]: they thought they desired.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought it played a really good role
in that kind of breaking down some walls
[SPEAKER_04]: that were just always there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't always look great in a bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sticky little fluffy, I mean, it really,
you had to hit it right to get a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: resin on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even if it didn't have a lot of resin
on it, it had big flavor and it had that
[SPEAKER_04]: zippy high that was real clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brokers would buy it on the nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, well it seemed like- But then
trimmers would cry because they wanted
[SPEAKER_05]: that big, the stuff that he was just
talking about, all that big chunky
[SPEAKER_05]: resinous, that stuff's easy to trim and
people can get through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour gets popular and a bunch of people
are growing that cut and it's feathery and
[SPEAKER_05]: shitty and loose and sticky and you have
to be all gentle with it to not fuck it
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would give trimmers- Why they were
fucking doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour introduced psychotherapy to trim
bossing because you had to convince your
[SPEAKER_05]: trimmers, this is gonna be worth it,
please do this, I know it sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was a struggle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it looked ugly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outdoor, I mean, it still had all the
turps and the good buzz and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, but it did not form up into a piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I saw some people growing in
greenhouses and feeding it intense food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were kind of more on the hippie organic
side, so we weren't dropping big,
[SPEAKER_04]: we weren't throwing grow more on it or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember people pulling a lot of
different looking stuff out of that same
[SPEAKER_04]: clone just by the way they were feeding
it, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could get some pretty big dense buds
out of it if they nuked it with food.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, top three strains,
I'd almost say sour, sour, sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really that attached.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm into keeping on moving and seeing what
comes out of these seeds that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: collected or bought or whatever over the
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really get that attached.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all give me high.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's certain highs I like better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm willing to have a bad buzz just to
try something new.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something I don't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like to keep moving because I wanna
see plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a hobbyist when I got into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like more plants, all from
seed preferably.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like information to me to go to
those kinds of gardens and just see
[SPEAKER_04]: expressions, see different tendencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: After a while, you're just like,
oh, that's heavy Afghani at this guy's
[SPEAKER_04]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something like me and Caleb and a
bunch of other people that are big into
[SPEAKER_02]: identification through visual and bringing
for traits and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one advantage that we had was seeing a
lot of different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I told you the other day,
my mentor, Hogg, he would always tell me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you wanna learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: You learn by growing the baselines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baselines, baselines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, skunk one, haze, you wanna grow
as many different types of Afghanis as you
[SPEAKER_02]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanna grow as many Thais as you can
and Mexicans and Colombians.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't grow those, you don't know
shit about pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what he told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you see, one of the things that always
interests me when Rings and I are in one
[SPEAKER_05]: of our many combos is that there's certain
lines that he's been playing with for a
[SPEAKER_05]: very long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you really get to see because
you've crossed it to a lot of different
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the traits that are dominant that
keep popping up?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it give to crosses?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's things that he'll be like to me,
he'll be like, a lot of people don't like
[SPEAKER_05]: this line, but here's four things that I
just love that it just throws in its
[SPEAKER_05]: progeny all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I kind of lean towards it because
of these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's stuff he's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a little collab, if you personal
collab, where he had some, you could talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had some old maple leaf indica from
Sensi Seeds in that era where they were
[SPEAKER_05]: still selling it that we blended with a
bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dynamite.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been sours and cushions and
various different lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he makes seed basically every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of this stuff, someone was asking
in the comments, when did you first get
[SPEAKER_05]: blue dynamite?
[SPEAKER_04]: 2002.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's when I got sick of just kind
of breeding my stuff to itself over and
[SPEAKER_04]: over and kind of just being like,
okay, this stuff has this kind of range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to see other people's shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see what these people in Canada
are fucking with or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had read about maple.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ordered some maple seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny because I've boughten so
many things over the years to check them
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these things that I hear old schoolers
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only things I really have that are
still fresh and poppable in my collection
[SPEAKER_04]: to this day have blue dynamite in them or
maple leaf in them, everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just come and gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that I think those things are
the greatest or this or I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: none of it's the greatest to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just all more, more, more,
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to see more plants,
but they were reliable.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were reliable to do what they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the maple was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't very good looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally it had a nice smell and it had a
great smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said a lot of turpentine expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was some cushy in there or more
Jan Sapkany type.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when, when Natsu and I did that
little collab, I remember Caleb hit him up
[SPEAKER_04]: and said, do you see any actual maple
leaves?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent it to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, we, we kind of, we kind of did
like a little open pollination with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it was very big.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we got four boys and three girls
to pop out of some of the old seed,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we let them pollinate each other like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we threw in a bunch of like,
uh, clones that I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, if I, you know, chems, chem 91,
chem D, Mendo P, uh, the Tanjo,
[SPEAKER_05]: the super silver haze, the headband,
uh, you know, just a collection of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: G from seed in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I threw a few things from seed in there
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've grown, I mean, not so as in pop
many of those, but I popped, I've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds and hundreds of plants out of
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the Loompa headband maples,
and I had a Karma OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had let go and a buddy of mine wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say that Karma OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: She'd never heard of her.
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a buddy a few years ago call and he
was off the grid and he was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to just depth a whole bunch of seed
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get some seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I gave them tons and I gave them the
Loompa headband with the maple and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Karma OG I had made with the maple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, it's like the classic OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Story where they're all kind of the same,
even though they got all these names,
[SPEAKER_04]: those two rows, those two rows,
they might as well been from the batch,
[SPEAKER_04]: the same batch of seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was basically like two main
expressions and they looked like each
[SPEAKER_04]: other, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I like running seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to just see that kind of shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed, um, I, the other day I was
trying to add it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was something like nine different OGs to
the Loompa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just to see how each different
one combined to the same exact mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty true breeding through the
same expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there, there was very little variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like most of the, like the SFV and
the Louie and all that, that you can't,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to tell them apart.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a little different smells and
stuff, you know, in the different cuts,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the genetic there, whatever it was in
them, wasn't that far apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting in that regard because,
uh, you know, just so people know too,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not like, I don't think that those
maple seeds that we use were like from the
[SPEAKER_05]: original pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had probably been re-produced a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just bred to themselves several
times to just keep them going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was 15 years after I bought
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the med woman?
[SPEAKER_04]: Med woman?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who brought, Oh yeah, that dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't believe he posted a picture of
this med woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Med woman was a Northern lights,
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look it up, it won a contest up in
Oregon or Washington years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it won for being like a good medical
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a buddy up in Eugene that sourced
some really great clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in 06, 07, I was living up in Mount
Shasta area and my buddy from Eugene came
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought from Roseburg, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought med woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought a grapefruit cut that is unlike
any grapefruit I've ever seen again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the, it's one of the few ones
I wish I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause usually I just don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just want to pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that grapefruit was fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got, he brought down some really great
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I threw, I threw my, this, this whole,
this thing of my friend and I made the
[SPEAKER_04]: bylaw.
[SPEAKER_04]: I threw that on everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's what we had.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had moved back down here and we brought
these beat up moms down here and nobody
[SPEAKER_04]: really had the capacity to like take cuts
and keep stuff or, or we weren't
[SPEAKER_04]: interested at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a transitional time in my
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we just threw what pollen we had on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have a whole shitload of those
somewhere in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: The seeds of the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grapefruits, the one that got away.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the last batch of those seeds I gave
to a buddy to grow out the year we had our
[SPEAKER_04]: fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: They burnt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no more grapefruit hybrids?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, and we've tried to find that,
that cutting in Oregon several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried to be very hard with such a
generic name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to grow out relic, grapefruit to
see it because he was in the similar area
[SPEAKER_04]: and he had a lot, he had a lot of the same
things he worked with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shishkeberry, cheese, grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, he probably had the same ones I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no crazy grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was old school smells in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool, but it was not a different
kind of grapefruit probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people call different C 99s,
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the sweet pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have grapefruit, Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many different
grapefruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the good thing about it is,
is that it's like, I was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's kind of funny when people find
some kind of turp or combination and then
[SPEAKER_05]: start to claim that like anything that
does that comes from them, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you, like if there's grapefruit,
there's going to be grapefruit again,
[SPEAKER_05]: just because we lost the turp combination
of certain ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's common enough that it popped up in
enough different things that I'm confident
[SPEAKER_05]: it'll exist again in some format.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the blueberry story,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, one person claims all smells
of blueberry and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all his descendants, you know,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that like I've seen blueberry
pop out of Irene sour diesel, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like super blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible to find in all kinds of
different combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always run into it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, especially if your seeds have a
good deep pool, you know, me, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could get all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when I grew out the maple Mendo
perps, I probably popped, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: two, 300 of them or at least 200 of them
are, you know, to be conservative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Range is fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get such, and that's fun to me at this
point, instead of trying to make something
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent, I almost would rather make
something wild at this time that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: actually get something unique out of,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Caleb makes a really good point,
dude, where he talks about, like he used
[SPEAKER_05]: the Mendo perps as an example,
cause it has a really wide genetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like, if I gave a hundred S ones to
like seven or eight different friends and
[SPEAKER_05]: asked them to select what they like and
breed with it, you would probably end up
[SPEAKER_05]: with wildly different selections and
people would take it in their own way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wouldn't be similar at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the maple is kind of like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The maple, the maple from Sensi is
probably, it's probably like two or three
[SPEAKER_05]: different of Neville's maple cuts and a
little skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably pretty wide,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Mendo's wide, so you cross
that and you just get like a whole host
[SPEAKER_05]: of, it isn't really is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The maple was dominantly, like I told Matt
the other night, it had long inner nodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had fluffy kind of turpinoline based
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some were resinous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some looked pretty ropey dopey,
but everybody liked it as far as just
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But every once in a while, I'd say the
rare thing in that line was to get
[SPEAKER_04]: something that actually had a little
density to it and a resinous appearance to
[SPEAKER_04]: it and more of like a fat leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't the common thing, but it was
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had that same experience with
Black Domino, the exact same experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one that I expected to find some
faster finishing, almost blackish purple,
[SPEAKER_02]: like really resinous, cushy looking
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I thought was exactly what you
described, which were like 13,
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 weeks of thick, airy, fluffy
turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one actually didn't have a lot of
variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I saw, it was just all tended to
be that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure there was other stuff in it,
just in the fact that I popped that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you'd have to pop like 30 or better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I popped 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, what are you going to
find?
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember people ordering Sensi Afghani
ones based on the picture looking leaf and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are all just super tall, super leggy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not get fat leaf, buff,
structured shit out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of really boofy,
ugly Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only seen like a few really prime
cuts ever selected from that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that, you know, a lot of the
Afghan that first came over to Mendo and
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt and stuff, a lot of the old
timers, I think that's a consistent thing
[SPEAKER_05]: with Afghani in the sense that there's a
lot of kind of boofy Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Nick ran that G13 NL2 from Neville,
some of the last original seeds he had,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is exactly as he's describing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was turpinoline, loose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he wasn't stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, there's an aspect where then
you find a fino that you want and breed
[SPEAKER_05]: with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are, you know, it's like that's
kind of like everybody wants land race,
[SPEAKER_05]: but nobody wants diversity because that
means it's like they don't want to like
[SPEAKER_05]: pop a few packs and it all sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I get excited about ugly plants at
this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like to me, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of those really ugly things
smoked really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of this really dense,
crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, that's not like the most I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get you some of that rose flow I
grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I gave the rest to crybaby of it
pure, but it is some of the ugliest
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking shit I've ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It burns up with any nutrients,
but it's bright red, pretty leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's so much pretty about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for flows, there's like no density to
it, but it breeds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but ugly as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's one of those that it's very
unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we didn't need to really be
visually that appealing until Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I view the Instagram era as like a massive
change in what we'd had to look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was lots of weed that was somewhat
ugly, but if it worked and smoked and
[SPEAKER_05]: tasted really nice and got you zippy high,
like you were stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he was talking about that sour,
you know, that sour, it was, it was,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was STEMI.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was loose.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funky looking in some ways,
but it got you ripped high and tasted
[SPEAKER_05]: great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of it a little different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the market and people just always,
especially when spending 50 bucks was a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot to them because they didn't have much
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted it to be like a, they wanted
the appearances that we used to call it
[SPEAKER_04]: fake, fake tits and bleach bond hair weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they wanted dense, crystalline
buds just to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because blackberry Kush have blackberry
Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly doing, you know,
I remember I never fucked with that clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw tons of it, but I remember getting
an ounce of weed in San Francisco in the
[SPEAKER_05]: nineties once.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, we, you know, we just called
it hydro, you know, it was some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor and there was only like nine buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were like so pumped, you know,
because each bud was like two to four
[SPEAKER_05]: grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like looking at like these chunky
or like, Oh God, somebody gave me like the
[SPEAKER_05]: breeder stash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, it was one of those
things where it was like, it wasn't that
[SPEAKER_05]: common to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you wanted visually appealing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember anything about that weed,
except for how impressed we were that it
[SPEAKER_05]: was nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it looked nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it was just blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just bright green and bright orange
hairs and frosty and all these big chunks.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times people when they got an
eighth that just had one chunk in it,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were kind of butthurt, you know,
like they, they, or they questioned if you
[SPEAKER_04]: were giving them 2.8 instead of 3.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it, but if it was good, if it would
feel as strong, they wouldn't forget,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they'd, they'd want more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked, what were the earliest
purple strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say the earliest, well, the real,
the earliest ones were just overripe
[SPEAKER_04]: depleted plants that maybe turned purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they weren't, we, we thought,
Oh, somebody said they had purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd be like, Oh, it's garbage,
you know, because it was always like
[SPEAKER_04]: something left on the vine depleted,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Leightonville, Leightonville had in
fact, that ties back to the underwear guy
[SPEAKER_04]: in the shack.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, there was a real common type in
Leightonville.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, I kind of sometimes I think of
this with the Mendo perp story.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of my own take or whatever,
but there, there was a green and a purple
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were both really pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could tell the purple was supposed to
be there instead of something that was,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a reflection of some,
something not good, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the strain that people called the
purple from Leightonville?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's the second time I've heard
the Leightonville purple, like a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: Leightonville purple mentioned in relation
to like one of the early purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of families that I'd met back then
had the similar stuff and it'd be like
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd have either this bright green.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was never real dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was like a purple side that
was really pretty that would be in there
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and it often had a real sweet,
like fruity type of smell to it also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's an aspect too, that people
should know that what, what Rings is
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about when like overdone shit is
fabric and people would do first and
[SPEAKER_05]: second and third cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of times there would be
purple weed that would be like all the
[SPEAKER_05]: smalls that everybody left to ripen and
they'd stick out in the cold and they'd
[SPEAKER_05]: turn dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like all the under light under
fed stuff that would happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they would cut that and put it
into pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was the same price as the tops
back then, you know, it just sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but it was still, yeah, people would
really milk their shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't see not too many people
cleaned up their plants to try to make
[SPEAKER_04]: their tops the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they would just pick those tops,
let those other things go until they did
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some strains really actually did okay
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them would just shit out as
soon as you picked on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would, everything else would be
shitty, but they would still pick them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick it and sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was this aspect where people
thought, oh, we can leave this stuff on
[SPEAKER_05]: and let it ripen cause it's under done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It never got enough light.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just leave it out and it's not going
to rot cause it's too small.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that stuff would ripen and turn
colors because it would get pretty cold at
[SPEAKER_05]: night, you know, and then they would go
out and harvest it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was often like late batch under
under undergrown, you know, like remnants
[SPEAKER_05]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that, that, I mean, being a
hobbyist and moving out here and just
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing all that shit, it was just my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just the happiest boy in my twenties
running around these hills, looking at as
[SPEAKER_04]: much shit as I could.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being, being that age and,
and, and like, obviously I missed my era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that would have been something I
would have loved to have lived through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty cool to be able to pick
your brain and to be able to sit here and
[SPEAKER_02]: ask you questions about it and kind of,
uh, live via proxy through an era that I
[SPEAKER_02]: missed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're all born when we're born.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all get our turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you still got to see cooler punk
rock shit than I did too motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and you know what, I mean,
growing up in the town that I did,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was, it was almost unthinkable that
it could have happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just my older brother and their
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how they stumbled on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I, that's how I got sucked into
is, was who became my older brother-in-law
[SPEAKER_02]: gave me punk rock scene with little,
little kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still was for all those years too,
moving out here and being able to run down
[SPEAKER_04]: to the city, down to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes I'd see bands I knew from
the Midwest played in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was always fun too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reunions in a straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you wanted to
cover?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so one of the things that we could
cover that kind of ties into what we were
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about is that both rings and I
arrived in Mendo when it was, I mentioned
[SPEAKER_05]: it before, but when it was kind of poor
and weird, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, it was very odd place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, and then, you know,
people think too, like people used to come
[SPEAKER_05]: to Mendo all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And be like, Oh my God, weed is legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did this thing where we passed this
thing, measure G, which kind of basically
[SPEAKER_05]: forbade the cops from messing with you too
hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you only had 25 plants and you had your
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people would come to Mendo every
week and be like, weed is legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you would be like, Oh my God,
no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's very much a cat and mouse
game that goes on between you and your
[SPEAKER_05]: neighbors and where you're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: What part of the County, there was
neighborhoods that, you could get away
[SPEAKER_05]: with it fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was neighborhoods where like
retired doctors or lawyers or whoever
[SPEAKER_05]: would just report anything that they saw.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you didn't know like which streets
and which areas were kosher and not,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could come up here and like way get
like, like in the wrong spot and get the
[SPEAKER_04]: most amazing things was that you could go
to the sheriff's department and buy 25 zip
[SPEAKER_04]: ties for 625 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could yellow big yellow zip ties.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in the sheriff's department,
giving these zip ties from some old lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd go and wrap them around your
stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just felt like, fuck the
neighbors, whatever they can bitch all
[SPEAKER_04]: they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got these things, the cops,
it knew I have only 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're, you felt pretty empowered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that created probably I would say in,
I don't know, I've been here for four or
[SPEAKER_05]: five years or longer than, so it was
probably 0203 maybe was when it really
[SPEAKER_05]: started what we call like the green wave.
[SPEAKER_05]: So probably like 0203 to maybe like 09.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was just an immense wave of
outsiders that came into the County all at
[SPEAKER_05]: once buying up property.
[SPEAKER_05]: They drove up the cost of properties by
enormous amounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: People really started blowing it up huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It changed the culture of the place
because anytime you get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: outsiders coming in too fast, they can't
learn from the people that were already
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there was like friction between the
people that had been here for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people that were just sort of
like, there was people that were like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought this land.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the country, which means I'm
American and I can like fire guns and get
[SPEAKER_05]: drunk and drive 70 miles an hour up the
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can drain the community spring and I
don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm growing weed and fuck my neighbors and
suck a dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'd be like, Oh no, no, no,
no, that doesn't actually work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, people will end up in a
hole motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Mendo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the beginning of clones too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the beginning of like the seeds,
the seed, the past was just disappeared
[SPEAKER_04]: into clones at that time too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I remember being really bummed
because I knew I could see it happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, all this diversity is just,
going away to Barry White, AFGOO and Blue
[SPEAKER_04]: Dream clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all these people would have grown 25
plants from seed anytime before this,
[SPEAKER_04]: but now they're just monocropping one,
one clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, you know, they would come here
and they would want to make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: money.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them wouldn't even stay here over
the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they would come seasonally to
make money and bail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it changed the culture of the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It brought a lot of money and it
definitely improved thousands upon
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands of, of rural properties that got
built up and made nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you Kaya the main hub?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it, it put a switch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It polished the turd, if you will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I mean, when I first moved Willets,
which is the town north of us and you in,
[SPEAKER_05]: in Mendo was half of it was boarded up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had some really hideous buildings.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was way on the downturn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now what's funny, the reason why I
brought it up is because we, we've been
[SPEAKER_05]: talking a bunch about how we watched all
these people flow in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now with the collapse of the weed
economy and the prices dropping to so
[SPEAKER_05]: crazy and everybody getting used to
growing volume, which rings hates and
[SPEAKER_05]: growing a bunch of B and C grade weed and
just hoping it was good enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now all these people are flowing back out
of the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everyone that came in for easy
money is like, Oh, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there were, there was a lot of rich
kids, a lot of, you know, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: you had to have some, it was either like
big hustlers from, from cities all over
[SPEAKER_04]: the country or rich kids, because you had,
it still costs a lot of money to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: property and actually spend it and pay
people and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to, you know, they had to,
you couldn't be broke and come to Mendo
[SPEAKER_04]: and start a scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they, there's a lot of people up here
that didn't want to admit that they got
[SPEAKER_05]: their parents to buy them properties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they started blowing,
and then they started blowing it up and
[SPEAKER_05]: like going on vacations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I used to think a lot of those people,
I was like, man, they're just so much
[SPEAKER_05]: better at what they're doing than I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I realized that like their
parents bought them the, like it was just
[SPEAKER_05]: play money to them while I was trying to
like live and survive and breed and do
[SPEAKER_05]: these different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, there was no backstop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they had the parent that like put
the, put the property in their name that
[SPEAKER_05]: put the down payment down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Safety nets would be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you didn't realize none of them,
none of them really wanted to tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them right now are going back to
work for their mom and dad's corporations
[SPEAKER_04]: after 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of blowing it up in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them too, to be honest,
they would come up here for two or three
[SPEAKER_05]: years and actually grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they would farm it out to a good
friend or friends that weren't doing as
[SPEAKER_05]: well and still take a huge percentage,
but it was their property.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would live in Santa Rosa or the
Bay or Southern California or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would come up at important times
to their property and make sure it worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they weren't really from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just kind of came up and blew it up
and made some money and then left and then
[SPEAKER_05]: used the funnel to like funnel money to
themselves so they could live where they
were.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we know lots of those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's kind of getting back to like
broken weird again in a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is painful to see, but you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like, it's not like Ukiah will
turn back into a poor town with a big
[SPEAKER_04]: factory on the edge of town.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, exhaust over the whole town.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it won't be back there because now
it's just, it's like the new affordable
[SPEAKER_04]: place for city people to put their money
because all the towns between here and San
[SPEAKER_04]: Francisco are ludicrously expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like every time a person sells a
house in town, there's a person from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Bay area willing to just buy it because
it's only 600,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas anywhere south of here,
it's 800 or a million for the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's an aspect where if you live
in like the valleys where yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: where we live right now, he's making fun
of me because I got this verbal tick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got rid of one and then others came in
my place.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's part where around Ukiah,
around Redwood Valley, around certain
[SPEAKER_05]: valleys, I think the properties are
maintaining value, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: like mountainous properties that when
people tried to get them permitted,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're just not permittable that without
hundreds of thousands of dollars of
[SPEAKER_05]: improvements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them don't even have enough water
on them to grow a garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if people came up here and spent
$350,000 buying a raw 20 acres that had no
[SPEAKER_04]: water on it and they set it up and buy
water and have it delivered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that the weed isn't bringing
money, what is that property worth really?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a lot of things too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is another kind of conflict in
our area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the regulations want people to come
out of the traditional pot growing areas
[SPEAKER_05]: in the hills and they want them to come
down to the valleys and like get legal on
[SPEAKER_05]: like ag land.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a bunch of retired
doctors and lawyers and wine people that
[SPEAKER_05]: are like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a grow down the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's supposed to hide up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought this retirement property.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all supposed to be rolling grapes and
orchards and not these degenerates with
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have a permit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Sonoma County had a big problem,
you know, at first when they were starting
[SPEAKER_04]: to go legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, who owns Sonoma County rich
conservative wine growers?
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of those people were
actually investing in weed once it really
[SPEAKER_04]: got legal, you know, but they hated it
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they probably still hate it,
but they're going to invest in it now to
[SPEAKER_02]: make some money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Money is money.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's an aspect where you see a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: My point to that, I guess, was that I'm
curious in two or three years what a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of these mountain properties look like
because the price of weed has collapsed so
[SPEAKER_05]: much and it might cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars just to fix your road
[SPEAKER_05]: so that like, you know, the fire
department and whoever else will sign off
[SPEAKER_05]: on you having a one license grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the angle of your road is more than
14 degrees, you have to get it paved or
[SPEAKER_05]: this or this or this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of these places where it used
to be traditional and good to hide and
[SPEAKER_05]: grow mountain weed and it's clean and it's
pure up there, it's not suitable for the
[SPEAKER_05]: current form of legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you get lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very few of them had enough water.
[SPEAKER_04]: They barely had enough water to just
supply a normal household, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: let alone a big garden out on the left,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were all trucking it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: People in the last few years were
spending, trying to grow these 10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: square foot off of bought water.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were spending like 1200 bucks a day
or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People trucking in water and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water trucks running around everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're tanking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to a water truck driver that I
knew the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, ma'am, there ain't shit going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I didn't make shit last year
from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tons of people bought water trucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all the rage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was enough profit in it that it made
sense to do a lot of things like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I used to, I used to have this
running joke that like it'd be,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'd find something and it'd be like a
composting toilet, you know, cute little
[SPEAKER_05]: shack, you know, solar power, 20 acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'd be like 700 grand because people
would be like, oh, you could put 50 plants
[SPEAKER_05]: on that thing and make tons of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Paid off in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now what is that property going to
be worth in a couple of years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the, you know, what, what really is
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that weird?
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have a septic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have a this, it doesn't have a
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a spot on a hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many of these people that moved here
just had no idea how to like maintain a
[SPEAKER_04]: property.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like these properties are just
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're leaving them with just broken down
carports and shitty shacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They threw up real quick just to dry some
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, just garbage, tons of garbage,
you know, on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, they're crap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: People leave a lot of garbage that
everyone thinks that like Mendo and
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt is this beautiful, pristine
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of human garbage.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends from Santa Cruz would come up
here and go, man, why does everybody like
[SPEAKER_04]: having garbage out in their front yards?
[SPEAKER_02]: Up here and natural repository for garbage
yards too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And old fashioned is having some sort of
blue tarp ripped up and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's normal around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was places that we bought
that we went in and like they would take
[SPEAKER_05]: like an old barn or an abandoned cabin and
they would just fill it with their
[SPEAKER_05]: household trash because they didn't want
to have trash service.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'd have to put on like essentially
a hazmat suit and you rent most places we
[SPEAKER_05]: got ahold of in the late nineties through
the mid two thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first things you would do was
get however many 40 yard dumpsters you
needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could load 40 yard dumpsters with
trash and some people would just make a
[SPEAKER_04]: huge pile and cover it with gas and set it
on fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be a big black fucking black.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: People would, you know, it was an
interesting spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that's one million whippet
containers and all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in the whippet containers,
in the, in the open blast era of butane,
[SPEAKER_05]: it got really bad up here and people would
do stuff where they got scared of throwing
[SPEAKER_05]: away thousands of empty cans of tain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they would like use a backhoe and dig a
hole in the woods and just pour all the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the thing in there and drive over it and
then fill it back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, I mean, I've seen a lot of them
just left on the side of a road,
[SPEAKER_04]: huge piles, thousands and thousands of
butane canisters just left out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful wilderness with just a big
massive pile of butane cans laying around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, so there's an aspect to
that where like that whole open blast era,

lost his sister's innocence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what, what brought him to the butt
stuff worlds.

we can get.
