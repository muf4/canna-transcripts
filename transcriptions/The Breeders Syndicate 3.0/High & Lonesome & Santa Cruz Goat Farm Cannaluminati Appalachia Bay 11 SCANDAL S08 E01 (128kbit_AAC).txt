[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene, researching everything
from cannabis strain history, old
[SPEAKER_02]: smuggling tales from the first-person
perspective, to breeding science and news
[SPEAKER_02]: on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_02]: Notzodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with my buddy, Hi and Lonesome,
and Santa Cruz Goat Farm Pack,
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course, Notzodon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about some of our
upcoming 4.20 stuff we got going on for
[SPEAKER_02]: the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about some of
their history and some of their likes,
[SPEAKER_02]: wants, needs, desires in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have been at it a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a lot to offer and a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has been a long chase for both of
them, so it's kind of cool we get to get
[SPEAKER_02]: them both at once at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to go over some of
the party, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what we saw at the party,
what we liked, didn't, from what we saw at
[SPEAKER_02]: the party, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both have handy avatars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come prepared, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Handy avatars.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi and Lonesome, let's talk about some of
your new lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, of course, your Appalachia,
which is pretty well known for many
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about it a little bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's an F3 I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went back and I had actually worked the
line to F5 and I wasn't really happy with
[SPEAKER_04]: what I had selected.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went back to the F2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I popped 50 of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I selected two males and three females and
kind of let them go at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted more of the green crack side
coming through on the turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one thing you hear a lot about
Appalachia is about like the creamy milky
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff coming through in crosses.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more a fan of the tropical side of the
green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same.
[SPEAKER_04]: That creaminess kind of came through the
Trace Dog male that I used.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of those that I popped, they were very
potent like the females, but they didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have the rankness that you would expect
with a Kim D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how did that cross to the Appalachia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, did none of the rankness really
crossed over in the outcrosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see it in different generations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a ton, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more of like a sweet cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you see it in Stardogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it in a Kim 4 too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a bit sweeter,
not as nasty, not as like disgusting
[SPEAKER_04]: garbage as Kim D.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so that's kind of what I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to go back to the F3,
kind of narrow it down instead of keeping
[SPEAKER_04]: it wide open, narrow it down to what I
wanted out of it and what I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you like about the green crack?
[SPEAKER_02]: It made you want to choose that as a mom,
or was it just like one of the moms that
[SPEAKER_02]: you happen to have in the room when you
were doing the run?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what was specifically going on in
your mind?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, originally when I did it,
I was doing quite a bit of outdoor on the
[SPEAKER_04]: East Coast, probably middle 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And green crack performed extremely well
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, except it needed some staking,
which when you're gorilla growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't trail it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't, you know, it's a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to put, I wanted to put it on
a little bit more robust frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd had Kim D for a little bit at that
point and you know, I was smoking it a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's what I wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the plants were also extremely robust.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I crossed it to green crack,
purple oracle, Kim 4, Kim D, an Acapulco
[SPEAKER_04]: gold cut that I had at the time and
abusive OG push.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Acapulco gold cross, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never grew that when I gave them all out
to friends and I never really heard
[SPEAKER_04]: anything back about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the only two that have any kind of
lasting value are the, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: the green crack cross and the purple
oracle cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you said there was a Kim 4 trade
dog too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, what I found in it was very
similar to start off.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some really nice Kim type plants
in there and you know, some stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't, wasn't as ranked, you know,
some, some of that creamy sweetness coming
[SPEAKER_04]: through, but still, you know, extremely
good quality smoking plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you got what you wanted out
initially out of the trace dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, I kind of wish I had gone back
through some F twos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a few F twos, but I never really
pursued it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, at this point the seeds
are no longer viable, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it's, it's cool line.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, um, you know, I feel like if you
F2 that you'd open up a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, trace dog and Kim 4 is kind of
like your own version of start off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it'd be a different male or
it'd be, it'd be a different selection
[SPEAKER_01]: from the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, um, I just made a kind of personal
amount of them to go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, uh, I always like to keep like
a doomsday spash of seeds and all my cuts
[SPEAKER_04]: and just like, you know, I'm, you know,
I'll just, uh, nobody floating around out
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can have something to go back to,
to look through even, even plants that I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't like how I usually will pollinate
them before I drop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you just never know like something
down the line might trigger that sense
[SPEAKER_02]: member.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, I really wish I had that,
even though at the time it doesn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: seem viable or feasible for certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, you know, it's fun to waste all
that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And energy and time, money.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I thought about before,
before we get too far away from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just the point I might make,
which is that, uh, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing a multi-stage breeding
thing to save seeds from every stage of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, if you feel like you screw
up, which is often, you can go back and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, I'd want to redo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was just talking about, I took it to
F5 and I didn't really like some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: direction that it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, then I went back all the way a few
generations and started taking it a
[SPEAKER_01]: different direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I hear about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people say they do that all the time,
but there is very rarely any proof of
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone ever doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, you've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been X amount of years between it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that that's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually have the F5s of Appalachia
here from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know he took it to F5 and went back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, that's pretty
commendable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you just don't see it very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think like too, like the era that,
that high and lonesome is talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I think it was more common for
people to like play around and work their
[SPEAKER_01]: own little lines a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way before there was like a bunch
of like American seed sales or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's kind of like a, you make seeds
and it's a one-off and they exist until
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I think it was a little bit more
common, you know, at least amongst like
[SPEAKER_01]: weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: To like, you know, you make something and
then it kind of becomes the base of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing and you cross it to this and
you cross it to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it, it, it,
and a lot of it, like he was saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all about like, I'm breeding for
personal smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you a lot more freedom than if
you're breeding for the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're just breeding for things
that you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it all started, you know, the whole,
even just growing, it started by trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure I had the best quality weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I think that's the best way to
breed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mean, it's, it's, it's,
you're not being true to yourself if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not, because how are you going to
enjoy the smoke and like go through tons
[SPEAKER_02]: of different, you know, examples and not
enjoy it and pick a keeper that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be stuck on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can lose a lot of, a lot of passion
for something real fast by, by cheapening
[SPEAKER_02]: it that way, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some people out there that
like all their phenos and stuff that they
[SPEAKER_01]: get found, get found by other people
because those breeders don't crack them
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make them, name them, package them,
sell them, and then they find out through
[SPEAKER_01]: others, whether or not anything good
happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would say that's kind of
become the standard these days a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, but in the era that High and Lonesome
is talking about, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 plus years ago or whatever,
I don't think that was the standard then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get rid of anything back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we stray too far, I do want to
ask, cause I know this is going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: number one question people want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you meet B, Bodhi, and when did
he acquire the Appalachia from you to
[SPEAKER_02]: work?
[SPEAKER_04]: So he and I had been, you know,
chatting and exchanging seeds on,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it might've originally been ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_04]: But probably 06-ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he'd send me a few things he
made.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd send him a few things I made.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I did the Trace Dog crosses,
I believe I sent all of them to him just
[SPEAKER_04]: for him to check out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't even know he had popped any
until he hit me up asking if it was okay
[SPEAKER_04]: if he released some seeds that he had made
with the Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, I'm not sure it was
something that he meant to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that's just kind of how it worked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he made some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, people are still popping it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are still passing out cuts from
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely a very comprehensive job
he did of crossing it to everything
[SPEAKER_04]: relevant at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a very common sentiment that a
lot of people feel that some of their
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite stuff came from that,
you know, like the Appalachia crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my favorite moments ever in
life was being able to watch you and Bodhi
[SPEAKER_02]: meet in person for the first time and then
right away in the sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: How sweet is that, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Together?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's a hell of a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of those people that,
you know, you meet him in person and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: actually genuine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a rare thing, but he's as
nice as he comes off and just a hell of a
[SPEAKER_04]: cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, we were all holding hands
staring out the window as you guys drove
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad it wasn't into the sunset,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just almost a little bit past
sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody had a glow going on,
though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a nice pregnant glow the next
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Pat, let's talk about some of your
stuff, dude, like you kind of popped out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the window and the wood works with some
old cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have an old Afghan cut that you work
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You work with a lot of train wreck stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of your big releases, your first big
drop was a train wreck reversal and you
[SPEAKER_02]: hit a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to talk about some of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where do I begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've always kind of had interest
in genetics, you know, just growing over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But initially when I got into the game,
it was all clones for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and my crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you'd come across the
occasional seed pack or somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like we'd shoot up to where is
it up to B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: and grab things once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not beasters, but, you know, whatever
seeds I had hidden in the corners up there
[SPEAKER_00]: in the gas lamp area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as much as seeds were
available and like not so as told the
[SPEAKER_00]: stories, you know, a lot of that was going
on down down south from where I was at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was where I'm thinking is when I was
living up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up in the northern part of the county,
you know, seeds were prolific down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a reason that generations of
people, you know, breeding and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clones are just so accessible back in
the day that there wasn't really a need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go hunting and try to find whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it always kind of been on my radar,
but it never been necessarily something I
[SPEAKER_00]: turned towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, being in the game long
enough, you come across certain cuts that
[SPEAKER_00]: you just fall in love with, even if they
fall out of style and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I caught on pretty quick in
the 2000s, you know, to the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: turnover of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'd see something just be
prolific and would disappear and you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't see it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I determined that I would have to
hold on to some of these things and see
[SPEAKER_00]: where that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just, you know, years pass and all
of a sudden you become this keeper of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the hell you thought was good
from way back when.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of in terms of just
what my, you know, the way my path was
[SPEAKER_00]: laid out with the whole growing scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, fast forward to now,
you know, I've always been on the DL for
[SPEAKER_00]: the most part with what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really have a big intention
of riding the wave into the legal market
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to go too heavy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like your choice of words there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Riding the wave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, riding the wave, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't feel like, yeah, I did not have
my board out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't ready to go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided, well, you know,
hey man, this is part of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, you know, just move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing as my therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but I also am kind of bored here
and I don't feel like living by the
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm of the garden, so to speak,
like I had for so many years and I needed
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of pivot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like anything, you know,
considered doing that for years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but played around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, come the time that I'm
starting to get real bored, not wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward, growing weight anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, you know, this is that right
time to have fun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And get into the genetic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just kind of took what I had
in my armory and started messing around
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you find the crew in the first
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This crew right here, this crew,
I came across, I came across you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, unlike some of the other cats in
this field, like I stayed true to trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay under the radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never got onto the forums back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, not so in those, we,
you know, send people to go buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies at the store and not have your
license plate get tagged or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just kind of always abided by that
code and never got onto the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then IG comes around, I would say
maybe 2017, 16, 17, 18, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started thinking about reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hey, man, I got this T-dub cut
and, you know, I want to see, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: open her up and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started paying attention and as a
matter of fact, I got in touch with Brian
[SPEAKER_00]: over there at Radio Ridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And asked him, hey man, what's the deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who's the go-to here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put your name on it and you get
ahold of Matt and here's Matt's number,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what's up, talk to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must not have liked your ass,
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's like, fuck this guy,
I'm gonna send him to Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this dude's a kook, here we go,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, yeah, long story short,
that's how I got in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, he vouched for me in
terms of being somebody relatively solid
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, for me, what it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I appreciate by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you had Blue Dream, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And ever since I've lost that cut,
I've had people telling me, I got that
[SPEAKER_02]: cut, don't worry, I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not once has anyone ever been able to
show me butt of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen pictures of stuff that looked
just like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I would get it, it would smell
like fucking flow or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just was off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked just like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you brought it down and I was
like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only does he have real Blue Dream,
he has train wreck too.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are little time capsules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, it wasn't just that,
it was how well they were grown,
[SPEAKER_02]: how well they were cured, all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hit all the points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, God, this guy cares about
his fucking weed a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he cares about good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where I realized like,
this is legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see what this dude's story is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without going into detail,
too much detail, obviously you come from
[SPEAKER_02]: like the surf background, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, central coast, coastal life for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not a big surfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a skater, snowboarder kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was a part of your culture,
who you hung out, the kind of grouping of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, why you would have had access to
these certain clones in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely tied into the whole
lifestyle, just growing up in the 90s over
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the central coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were getting away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't find weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found a surfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was selling the weed to the surfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And surfers usually had a pretty good
choice of weed back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them would travel around the
world, get some of the best weed on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having the kind of clientele you did
without being specific, I learned that you
[SPEAKER_02]: had to perform better than others to have
the kind of clientele you did at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I took notice of and why I realized
you had gotten so good at curing and
[SPEAKER_02]: drying and all that other stuff,
because they were pretty high in
[SPEAKER_02]: clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pretty picky, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, their dads were growers and they
grew up in the whole scene and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't bring swag to those dudes and be
like, yeah, I want a good price for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing maybe I should interject is
like, since High and Lonesome was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about Green Crack and now we're talking
with Pac about Blue Dream and Trainwreck
[SPEAKER_01]: is that there's some of these things that
like they became famous long enough ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and then kind of fell out of favor long
enough ago that people probably mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: only hear legends about them to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people like Matt was saying,
get fakes or get it poorly grown for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed versions where they use the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that sucks about that is
that often people talk about why they got
[SPEAKER_01]: burned out on a certain cut, not why that
cut had lasting fans to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with the three things I just
named with Green Crack or with Trainwreck
[SPEAKER_01]: or Blue Dream, all three of those,
there's a bunch of reasons why they got
[SPEAKER_01]: popular and people really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they ended up getting burned out
because people were growing huge amounts
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once huge amounts of it start growing,
a lot of people start doing it poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it gets a bad
reputation and then something moves on and
[SPEAKER_01]: people lose track of the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you were saying, maybe only a few
people end up holding onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are surprised at how good
this thing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something they've heard of,
but maybe in derogatory terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean, I just like there was a
lot of like when High and Lonesome was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking, I was thinking about how,
like basically once people in like Grass
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley and certain other regions got Green
Crack and started growing seven to 10
[SPEAKER_01]: pound outdoor plants, that kind of like
midsy Green Crack is what turned people
[SPEAKER_01]: away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, Green Crack is,
you know, in extracts and something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it actually has a bunch of really
nice terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a bunch of really nice structure to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very like cool flavor done well,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indoor 70 day Green Crack is tough to
beat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm looking so far to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just said, the other thing that
happens to people is they grow it too big
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they end up taking it 10 or 12
days early because it's done enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes all the difference too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the market gets flooded with a
bunch of, you know, I mean, it definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: happened with Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely both happened with Blue
Dream and Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three sort of suffered the same fate
in that they could be enough of a
[SPEAKER_01]: production plant that they got
overproduced and people thought the
[SPEAKER_01]: production version was the version.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in reality... So damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Blue Dream took a bigger hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Blue Dream took a much bigger hit
than just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Crack didn't because I knew who was
releasing seeds of it and who wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there weren't a lot of seeds released
at Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: There weren't like Green Crack seeds out
there you could buy en masse, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But Blue Dream, the second that thing
kicked off, we had Emerald Triangle Seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was, I believe, made in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, you had Humboldt Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had all these different companies
releasing their versions of what Blue
[SPEAKER_02]: Dream was, which was whatever bulk Spanish
company was pushing out as their blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what cuts got passed around as
Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: 99%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm convinced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm convinced H&L that like in the DAB
era, Green Crack has been renamed Papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those like tropical turps and
stuff like that, like they would never
[SPEAKER_01]: call it a Green Crack extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'd have some high-end Green Crack
rosin and they'd be like, ooh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live rosin of papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the papaya, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some tropical fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to say that Natso has any
knowledge that the papaya strain out there
[SPEAKER_02]: from the specific company is Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying that's probably what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, you know, even 15 years ago when
people didn't want to buy Green Crack
[SPEAKER_04]: around here, it went as mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: It went as papaya.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tango kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, you know, that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's half a dozen names for Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe even more that got made because
people got blown out on it and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, this isn't that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Blue Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of your Barry White story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but, you know, the point that I'll
scroll back on is that if you take
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who knows the strain,
like say pack or high and lonesome,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they grow a nice two, three,
four, six ounce plant, either in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or in an indoor environment,
people are going to be blown away by how
[SPEAKER_01]: good it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue the party away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people have forgotten why those
things got so popular in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they only think they got popular
because you could get an eight pound
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor plant that was bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not what got them popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beginning at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a grow in somebody's closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did not ever stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a three ounce, a three ounce green
crack plant is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think a four ounce Blue Dream
is a damn delicious, especially how long
[SPEAKER_02]: did you take it pack this last time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the party, I pulled it early
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I pulled it at 60, 60,
61.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was super berry for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the best I've ever had for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens when you grow a cut for,
you know, 15 better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better put out some work or some good
work after, you know, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really what, one of the things I,
you know, I remember talking to CSI about
[SPEAKER_01]: this probably, I don't know, eight years
ago or something where in his mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to what pack was saying about
where he was up in Humboldt and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, train wreck was one of the first named
clones that really spread around the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing community deeply in that zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was lots of seeds and there was
lots of name stuff that got like here and
[SPEAKER_01]: there it popped up, but like train wreck
really kind of had its moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first train that you started
seeing people wear t-shirts with the name
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck across the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never seen the shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt clothing company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was up in, up in Arcata,
uh, 2001, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they got smart and started marketing
strains on shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there weren't many, but train
wreck was the one that was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what you saw and you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what, uh, we never referred
to it or at least my crew being up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcata, it was never the Arcata train
wreck until years later, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as a, as a signifier, you know,
in terms of where it came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just train.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that popped up on the forums as a
designator, you know, once, once there
[SPEAKER_04]: should be a few fake cuts and,
you know, people would talk a lot about
[SPEAKER_04]: the, you know, this is the Arcata cut or
this is the E 32 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon rack was another one that was
floating around at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed to pop up once, uh, people
started releasing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Dutch started, started
messing.
[SPEAKER_04]: With it and, uh, what horse was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was tucking wood horse.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuck in wood horse, the big train.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember using name dropping him again,
but I remember when, uh, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: they're discredited, when Filos first came
out or something, uh, CSI called me up and
[SPEAKER_01]: he goes, do you want to know what,
uh, what DNA's, uh, lemon skunk tests as?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was all, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's all green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like it kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they're both skunk one,
they would kind of like maybe show up in
[SPEAKER_02]: some range together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just think like there's,
you know, and train wreck also,
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing train wreck got known for
was that it was the like, but long before
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone used the word turpentine,
um, you know, uh, train wreck turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got, it got kind of a moniker of like,
Oh, people didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what that turp was,
but train wreck was famous and well-known.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, this kind of smells like
train wreck to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a train wreck smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the Jack one, the Jack,
the Jack, the J one is track.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like train wreck, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, but those it's, so it's kind
of like, it's, it's almost a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say it's almost a bad
thing, but any strain that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential to be blown out huge has the
potential to get a bad reputation because
[SPEAKER_01]: people only try it blown out huge,
not dried, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Matt was saying about packs ability
to dry it and cure it and treat it nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so sometimes even getting a good
example of what made something famous can
[SPEAKER_01]: be harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you what, man, uh,
you know, there's, there's times where I
[SPEAKER_00]: put it out and I won't smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, no, that's not, no,
I don't want to share that with somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our buddy, uh, our, you know, we had some
friends of ours, the gathering that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever that are quite a bit younger
than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really cool to have them try
some of the classics that had faded from
[SPEAKER_01]: popularity, like long before they came
onto the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really neat for me, actually,
you know, that's where I noticed like the
[SPEAKER_02]: kids love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, this is blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were people talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just watching H&L push train wreck on poor
local man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd that go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he was kind of nodding off and I was
like, dude, it's 10 o'clock, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm way older than you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to go take a train wreck bong
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is right before I put a Sharpie in
his pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was listening to an interview that
packet did not very long ago last week or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember you talking about like
train wreck was the weed that like you
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled some bong rips right before you had
to do a bunch of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was get after it weed,
you know, it gave you that buzz where you
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like you could get some shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly so much so if you,
if you pull it a little bit early,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you can train wreck has
such a range of when you can pull it and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want to get off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull it a little bit early and it's
just so much more speedy, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's part of, uh,
part of what gave it its reputation of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, big blown out plants pulled it,
you know, 50 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it, it looks good enough at 50 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can yank it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why green crack was big with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like it sounded out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about getting seven of them in,
in a year if you're doing indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that that's the, and that's
another key why people end up getting feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like something's not that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even tell you how much sour diesel
in Mendocino County was pulled as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: it was good enough to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it probably should have gone into the
mid seventies and it hits 60 and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, you're not doing it for the love
at that point though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but it's like people just don't,
I don't think people see like that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: part about love that I don't think people
get where it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you, it's hard to come across people
that know how to grow it the right way
[SPEAKER_01]: that will take it the right amount of time
that'll dry it and cure it the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get that full effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of it's good enough to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good enough for the buyer won't
reject it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I'll tell you what, I can't say
I'm not guilty of that in my past,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, especially at certain points in
time where it was more economically
[SPEAKER_00]: feasible than, you know, just for the
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think when you stay in it long
enough, at least for me, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of mature into your grower
status, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like start off reading high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get it all, whatever,
but then you start to kind of not only
[SPEAKER_00]: dial in the plant, but you dial in your
style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you dial in your life, you mature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a different world to, you know,
consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't, you know, as many
connoisseurs people, they wanted a bag of
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they wanted it to be pretty
and taste good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if you could accomplish
that and then get a buzz, it was all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I was doing something outside,
like any of the things we just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was fall, I could probably let it
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I got good weather until it was
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm depping it and it's 90 to a
hundred degrees every day in Mendo,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit a point where it's all
downhill from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might not get that last five to
seven days that I would prefer out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's going to go south because
it's 98 and it's hot and the flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the calyxes are going to start to yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to start to get beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to pay my rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, here we had, we had
hurricanes every fall, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: or most every fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, in October, you might
get, you know, six inches of rain in a
[SPEAKER_04]: week.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it just, it can be terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so sometimes it was good enough to go
October one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to explain that to people all the
time when it comes to like nature farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where you're using, using the
sun or whatever that all downhill from
[SPEAKER_01]: here is an important decision to come to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is key because you can,
you can be like, Oh, I can make it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, I just made it
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the reasons, one of the
reasons why I was stuck to indoor growing
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, you get to play God in
terms of how long something's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, obviously, you know,
there's, there's good and bad with both,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, it's an interesting distinction
because as an indoor grower, mainly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that wasn't a consideration,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What time of the year it was, unless,
you know, I didn't have the right kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: insulation in the place of them growing or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we used, I mean, you know,
indoor, you know, not that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't go outside or whatever,
but the problem up here was that it got so
[SPEAKER_01]: hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always used to call it summer,
but yeah, same, same here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you knew that you knew the indoor
summer, but even just cause it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can not keep your shit under a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like people were running mini
splits back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, many splits didn't, we didn't,
you know, they didn't, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: technology is all the stuff that's common
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people realized how slowly
we had, some of us adopted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember how hot the lights were?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you didn't use the shields and they'd
be hanging and you'd walk by them and
[SPEAKER_02]: smell your skin burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, you know how many burns I have my
elbows from running like octagons where I
[SPEAKER_00]: had three exposed bulbs hanging in the
middle and you had to get in there to do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was always so brutal, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I always heard these wives
tales of that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: River, seeing my skin hanging off a bulb
and sizzling and it being just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't explode, but I always heard
like, yeah, don't get your finger oils on
[SPEAKER_02]: that bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll blow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was always, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like finger oils, like,
so I'd always like screw them in all
[SPEAKER_02]: careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd always grab a hand towel and screw it
in because I didn't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You polish them before you turn them on
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't need them exploding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a couple of times in life where
like they hit the top of my ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty sensitive spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm a tall, I'm a tall guy,
you know, and so you're moving around and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to, you know, but yeah,
but one of the things that we should
[SPEAKER_01]: mention too, is that, you know,
and I don't know high and lonesome if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to talk about this, but I would
imagine that when you were crossing a
[SPEAKER_01]: trace dog to, you know, to green crack,
maybe you could talk for a minute about
[SPEAKER_01]: like something that I'm always interested
in, which is like what you were hoping
[SPEAKER_01]: each parent was going to bring to the
children.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, basically the only issue
that I had with green crack were the
[SPEAKER_04]: structure of the plant and then the
structure and the high of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to get something with a little
bit more robust structure and something
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, had a little more,
not depth to the high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think that the character of green
crack is really nice, but just something
[SPEAKER_04]: that maybe hits you a little bit harder
behind the eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a skunk one high at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, green crack in my opinion is the
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely my favorite of the skunk
one type plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: By a big margin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, cheese is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have run that several times over the
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I can't smoke it, but so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But something about the like rotten mango
green crack is just so appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another one of your, your really
well-known cuts, and this is probably what
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew you best for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the cuts I chased the longest
was the poodle nuts cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who selected the cut, where it came from,
et cetera?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, um, it was selected by a friend
of mine from IC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he went by 40 grit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then I think after that 40 ounce,
uh, several, several names over the years,
[SPEAKER_04]: but he was blowing up warehouses of Urkel
before anybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: He always had the most dialed in Urkel,
his shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I remember smoking his weed and
it just being, it was like slingshotting
[SPEAKER_04]: him though it was dense, but it wasn't
blown out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, his problem was he was running
warehouses of Urkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: He needed something with some hybrid
vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and he and I used to bullshit a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that was one that when I was
making those crosses, I kind of pollinated
[SPEAKER_04]: the Urkel just to see if it was any more
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, you know, once the seeds were done,
I sent a bunch out to him and he,
[SPEAKER_04]: he ran them.
[SPEAKER_04]: He found, I think two cuts that he really
liked, but that one was the one that
[SPEAKER_04]: looked more Urkely and it, you know,
it got purple, but it had increased vigor
[SPEAKER_04]: and increased potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he started, you know, running
warehouses with that and crushing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his, I mean, his cuts, his selection
is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've crossed it to some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that line ended up being, you know,
as you went through generations of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was just more weird stuff popping up
from the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took it, I think to F4 and it was just,
you know, you'd get more mutants and it
[SPEAKER_04]: would just, it didn't have the vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have fucked it up, but,
uh, you know, it just, it's one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: things that I couldn't go, but so deep
into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the actual pool nuts cut is super
unique looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've seen it expressed this really
unique trait where it looks super knobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and I've seen pictures of some
of the out-crosses that have that same
[SPEAKER_02]: trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like bud structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The knob, knobby bud structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, um, yeah, that, that kind of
surprised me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not quite the, you know, round balls
you get with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it's, it's great weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells and I've told people this a
million times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people always talk about smelling
cuts, smelling really rank and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a perfect example of one for
me, where I can take cuts of that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: living room and in the bedroom,
Brynn be like, did the skunk spray in
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it really does smell like skunk
spray when you kind of like veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it finishes up so sweet and nice,
you know, it's very Urkel-y of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like Urkel does something similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has that similar skunky smell and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you take cuts and it's like,
wow, this is going to be skunky AF.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you, when you flowered,
it's super grapey in the end, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it almost gets there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people that are younger or don't
know, or weren't around during the Urkel
[SPEAKER_01]: era, um, one of the big issues with Urkel
was that, uh, it's not a very branchy mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy to get a lot of cuts off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people would veg it for a
long time before they bloomed it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of a slow grower, you know,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The node spacing is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel is one of those ones that you kind
of have to get it around the size you want
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be when you bloom it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to grow like six or
eight inches and stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a diesel or something that
has a butt, like it's going to double or
[SPEAKER_01]: triple in size and branch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Ion Lonesome was talking about
like his buddy wanting something with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit better, bigger, uh,
Urkel took it to its time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of puttered along, you know,
it was the, for me, it was the node
[SPEAKER_02]: spacing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it was, it was, it was just
constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like node spacing centimeters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to send it out and just constantly
stay on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took forever to veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be, you know, you could grow a
haze in the same time you could grow Urkel
[SPEAKER_04]: because you're going to have to veg three
times as long, four times as long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you flower it, you know,
it's, it's going to pretty much stay that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like not just a six, eight inches and
that's all you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my friends up here that were
successful growing Urkel, they would be
[SPEAKER_01]: blooming around of Urkel and they would be
vegging almost the entire bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For their next round to get the Urkel of
his, like the root ball and just the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a sufficient size that they could
then throw it into the bloom when the,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the other round was done and get
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to think of it, Urkel, another cut
that got bastardized by like being passed
[SPEAKER_02]: all around and a lot of crappy grows of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like, you know, you always hear
about how like lame and un-potent Urkel
[SPEAKER_02]: is, but like I've had my head ripped off
by good Urkel, like really legit put in my
[SPEAKER_02]: ass by good Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just rare.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all comes down to the grower and you
know, the conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow a giant outdoor Urkel,
it's just not going to be that quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like Urkel quite a bit, but I have
to admit it doesn't hit me the way it hits
[SPEAKER_01]: some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I will say Mr. Hill says you do not
like purples at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, you agree it's all chickweed
as not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's good to, it's good to have
strong opinions, I suppose, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Urkel is Urkel for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have this weird relationship with,
with Urkel and that whole round of purples
[SPEAKER_01]: because at least in Cal, I don't know it,
you know, we're high and lonesome is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at least in California, it completely
changed the weed game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is before like
Urkel and Mendo P and granddaddy purple
[SPEAKER_01]: and that like purple craze of like 040506
that kind of hit any good weed you grew,
[SPEAKER_01]: generally speaking, salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the Urkel and the purple
wave was the very beginning of like
[SPEAKER_01]: brokers being like, do you have this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take as much of it as you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't, I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to grow Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it, but I didn't want to grow it,
but that's what they were asking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a bunch of people that were
like, Hey man, I'm having a hard time
[SPEAKER_01]: moving my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, if I give you this
cut, they'll take every bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of started the movement of
like brokers want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to grow this where I think,
I think everybody probably on this call
[SPEAKER_01]: would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like before 2004, if you grew fire weed,
it was just going to go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to have a home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like the name game with really
started with purple craze and with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it went to diesels and it went to
cushions and cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those old strains,
like we were just talking train wreck,
[SPEAKER_01]: green crack, you know, blue dream,
you know, all these different things
[SPEAKER_01]: started getting lost to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they weren't as easy to move as
whatever was dominant in the scene at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still playing that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what ended up making them rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's crazy that it's awesome
that pack loved train wreck and blue dream
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to hold onto the real ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm very thankful for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of my collection is just stuff
that I personally liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I held onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or, you know, in high lonesome's
case, it's like, that's really what
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation needs is like different
groups being like these cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to hold onto them and I'm
going to grow them nice, regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the market is telling me,
because I, I mean, that, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the dividing line between chasing
the dollar and doing it for the love of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, when you, when you, when you hold
onto a cut long enough, it becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: partner of yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I always say train wrecks,
the longest relationship I've ever had
[SPEAKER_00]: with the girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said the same thing about the Maui.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I popped it when I was 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow up with these things,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they become this intimate part of your
life, regardless of the people accepted or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's, if it's in your zone and it's
what you want, then it really doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter if it comes or goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there, there was years where train
work was just one plant in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me your monocropping it for,
you know, the whole 25 years I've had it
[SPEAKER_00]: or however long it's been.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, she's, she's always,
always kept that special place in my
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've been around long
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the oldest guy in the world,
but I've been around long enough to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you wait long enough, shit comes
back around, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, and you learned by watching
others, never hand your shit over to a
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other, the other thing I think
is interesting about what we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about is that all these elites that we're
talking about from back then came about in
[SPEAKER_01]: a time when elites only got popular if
enough people liked to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this was an era where there was no
modern weed marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no hype machine yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like things got hyped because people
enjoyed growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people had to enjoy growing
them for them to become popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone had to like it, but enough of
the community had to like it for it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it just kind of would fall by
the wayside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had my clockwork orange cut in
San Diego and down there, it sold really
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sold really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was really stingy with it and I did
not like passing it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those who had it, I made sure they
didn't pass it out because it didn't get a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot, back then you couldn't
convince people that a strain was good
[SPEAKER_02]: unless they got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it was very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you couldn't force that artificial
hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, very hard to have artificial
hype during those days and even stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: was genuinely good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it didn't make it around, it just
didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just, if it was listed as,
as a 50 dollar eighth on the back page of
[SPEAKER_00]: high times over in Missouri, then it got
some air time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how funny about air time is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the internet probably, and like in the
forums during like high and lonesomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, hey day on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like the dog, what people call the
Chem 91 now was probably more popular than
[SPEAKER_01]: it was in California because my friend
that passed it out to the three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: people that got it, he wouldn't let us
give it out anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the most part, brokers were
like, well, how good can it be if I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the forums is where the hype
machine kind of got going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have somebody post, you know,
an OG Kush thread, showing some pictures,
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about their cut, you know,
talking about what it goes for in
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would just look killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, people would go ape shit
over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where it all started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, you know, people start arguing over
strange and, you know, it's, it's gotten
[SPEAKER_04]: us to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the lupus headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that scene one like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Names starting to get attached.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, people started getting
their names attached to cuts that they
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't create and they didn't pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just, you know, they were the one on
the forum who let it out to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's, it's their cut as their name
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, you know, that still goes on
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you better kick, you better kick
up royalties to some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think I do think there's,
I do think there's a difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: like your name gets attached to something
because people are trying to differentiate
[SPEAKER_01]: which one it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're saying comes from this person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were certainly some people early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Loompa or, you know, Ken from Ken's
GDP or something like that, where they
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally attached their name for
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and some people didn't attach
their name for control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like other, it's almost like
other, your friends give you a nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like people on the forum started
referring to things as a certain cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of just organically happened
where other people were like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to attach my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: To it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore I need credit or I need
money or I need seeds or all the little
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics that developed around possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's funny is, is I can't think of a
single person that intentionally attached
[SPEAKER_01]: their name to a cut that was actually the
originator of the cut, made the seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: popped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about strawberry cough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a tough one because I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he pop the seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he got a given to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, nothing against homie or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, obviously, like the,
the chem 91 got skunk, it got skunked VA's
[SPEAKER_01]: name attached to it because he was the
first person talking on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three people I remember that
intentionally attached their name was like
[SPEAKER_01]: AJ attached his name to sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken attached his name to GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Loompa attached his name to headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: All very choice people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can all hate me for it or whatever,
but I think those three, at least like
[SPEAKER_01]: they intentionally added their own name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think AJ was just the latest of the game
on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never, I never heard of that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a little break from being online
and you know, any of, any of the forum
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got back on about when I got onto IG
and started hearing about AJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, man, I've never heard of
this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it just, there are so many
things that are like that, that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I never heard of that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never heard of this hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just, let me just point out,
let me just point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to not be a popular thing to put
yourself out there in this game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried, you know, pack, I try to make
that point all the time where it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: the skill sets that kept us safe for a
long time, which is kind of being
[SPEAKER_01]: invisible and keeping your head down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of us were indoctrinated
into that lifestyle for 10, 15,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden in like 2012 or
2015, people start putting their faces
[SPEAKER_01]: onto things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that had never really happened before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went against a lot of the,
and then people started associating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, you know, burner with
cookie or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where it was like the person that was
the most vocal ends up being like the
[SPEAKER_01]: expert or the person that's like the most
in charge of whatever the strain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be an official on the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's, what's funny about that
too, is that I've had a bunch of talks
[SPEAKER_01]: with CSI, um, Urkel, I would say probably
blue dream and train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all kind of have very mysterious
origins.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, there's a lot of cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's out there that like, I,
there's a general consensus on most events
[SPEAKER_01]: that led to a cuts creation and the people
involved to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I've never, I mean, I've heard people
claim it, but I've never any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: three strains they popped up and who the
hell made them and where the hell did they
[SPEAKER_01]: come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still a mystery to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me, let me point out, you know,
that some of that might just be a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a, design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, there's a bunch of old
boys that still grow that I have known
[SPEAKER_00]: over my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't touch the internet and they
could care less about anything to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but doing what the, you know,
keep on keeping on growing the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scammers love that because it doesn't give
them competition to the origin story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of a sudden you can be like,
Urkel came from my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this and there's not going to be
anyone that's going to compete it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a monk showed up on my property
and just happened to bless us with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: with this cut or whatever, you know,
that was almost like the Ken Estes GDP
[SPEAKER_02]: story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point I got to cut in because
people are going to want to hear the Ken
[SPEAKER_02]: Estes story.
[SPEAKER_02]: H and L they're going to want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to, I got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of questions myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: See it's perfect time to bring it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ken Estes story from your point of
view, how do did it go down?
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I mean, you're the one that
tipped me off to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was the signal, Ben.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were, I was kind of, I was kind of in
the process of stepping away from the
[SPEAKER_04]: forums and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still checked in every once in a
while and, you know, mostly communicated
[SPEAKER_04]: with, you know, some of, some of my old
friends on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one day you sent me a message,
kind of letting me know that, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, Bodhi's female Appalachia cut that
he kept had been entered into,
[SPEAKER_04]: what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The major cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a major cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the high times there's just barely
doing cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the U S yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was like the San Francisco,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And evidently a cut had been taken from
Bodhi's mom room by I guess a helper and
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow Ken got it and, uh, liked it
enough that he renamed it Bay 11 and
[SPEAKER_04]: entered it into the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he won the cup with that cut of
Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to follow up on the success created a
seed line, not even using the cut to the
[SPEAKER_04]: best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, from what I think, if, if I'm not
mistaken, I think it was he had an Uji
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush seed line and he crossed that to
green crack and figured, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it'd be close enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, um, that was what came out
as Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember it being a, you know,
a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, you know, being like, this isn't
what that was, you know, drastically
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you kind of tipped me off to
that story on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember, you know, engaged in some
conversations about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was shocked that they invented it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, normally that I was kind
of down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like normally that stuff stays wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was, um, it would have been cool
to, you know, have won a cup with the
[SPEAKER_04]: name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, it was, it was still in cups
mattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at that time there was, it wasn't
like fully bastardized to where there were
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of cups, you know, cups a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was when cups winning a cup
could mean the difference between a
[SPEAKER_02]: thriving business or not, you know,
and it really pushed Ken's business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most people already knew who Ken
was from GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he had marketed himself with that,
but the cup win boosted the sales for that
[SPEAKER_02]: Bay 11 and his whole company and seed
launch massively.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was why I was like, this is fucking
gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the GDP thing with Ken is,
is pretty suspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely suspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I, you know, I don't tell this
story very much and I'll have to be kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like, I'll have to circumvent around
certain parts of it, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because, uh, the person that I'm going
to talk about is like a total anarchist
[SPEAKER_01]: outlaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were just mentioning who would
never want their name to be known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that person, um, is who Ken got
the GDP from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, up in my, up in my neck of the woods
and she, it actually came from a retiring
[SPEAKER_01]: Vietnam vet who lived up in the Hills by
me in the Laytonville area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, my friend was, uh, pretty and
female, which was pretty rare in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but especially as pack will know,
especially in the Humboldt or Mendo Hills,
[SPEAKER_01]: even rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a person to like own their own
properties and be doing their own things
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty rare back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she was kind of gung ho about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was kind of sweet on her a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he ended up giving her like,
I don't know, 50 or 80 seeds of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, of his own hybrids that he had made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she found GDP in the first batch that
she popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason I figured that out
really was because, um, I helped her build
[SPEAKER_01]: like a, uh, a 60 lighter in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, I knew her before she knew Ken
and she gave it to Ken because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: partners together on this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she wanted to stay totally anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't realize this about,
but this is sort of like the era where
[SPEAKER_01]: like the first real dispensaries were
opening up in the bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, places like, yeah, like the,
like you probably remember pack like the
[SPEAKER_01]: third floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, and stuff and, uh,
what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the vapor room, the vapor room,
the third floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was a few of them, um,
not very many back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was one you would always talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one that Matt, that you were
a little bit more familiar with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but be that as it may, um, Ken was
willing, she wanted to stay up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hills and stay anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was willing to go to the bay and
market it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it kind of became Ken's GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was, and there was no,
she was fine with it because the last
[SPEAKER_01]: thing on earth she wanted to do was attach
her name or show her face.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had outdoors, she had depths.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was under the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a, she had, you know, I mean a 60
lighter was a big deal back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a diesel thing in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wanted to stay completely hidden.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Ken's GDP, and that's kind of why
Ken's story changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he heard it secondhand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if people want to hear the full story
from the, the werewolf's mouth,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is, uh, there, you can go on Google and
if you look up Ken's GDP story,
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot what the name of the thing is,
but it's some like rapper guy interviewing
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he tells this real mumbly story and
you can still find the transcript that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wrote online if you look for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually transcribed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's, it's a little screwy,
um, until you transcribe and actually see
[SPEAKER_02]: what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he says that native American,
like shamans thought he was a really great
[SPEAKER_02]: white dude and helped them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, decided that he, they were going
to gift him this magical purple Vietnamese
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where this came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's interesting about that is that
the story goes, is that the guy that gave
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend the seeds was a Vietnam vet and
had brought back some, uh, seeds from his
[SPEAKER_01]: adventures over there when he was in the
army.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, it's basically like, as you know,
it basically became hill weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where he took these sativa and he started
crossing it to some of the Indicas that
[SPEAKER_01]: started coming in into the Mendo humbled
area and trying to get a plant that would
[SPEAKER_01]: finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it sort of became that thing
where it's like, it was like on that hill
[SPEAKER_01]: and in that neighborhood or whatever,
it was like, they were running this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and people had different versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was unnamed and, you know,
and when she popped them or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was still a variety of like sativa
to Indica leaning ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always picked for the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always picked a little bit more of
the sativa leaners because they needed the
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't want as much of the moldy
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably too, but a little two,
three foot chunky plant for, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: for, uh, you know, uh, woods in indoor
situation was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in the early two thousands and
the way that people grew back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a whole bunch of a whole carpet
of plants that were only two and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: three feet tall and chunked out was a
great look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, but yeah, he, you know,
he, he, he got that exact cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: From her and nobody even knows who she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say Vietnam vet jump
from a Vietnam vet to the native American
[SPEAKER_00]: shaman.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the biggest leap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, he did addition here in
addition there he's counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, what's funny pack is like,
you know, with you living up in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously it's, it's not like the,
the natives up there have like a super
[SPEAKER_01]: high opinion of like, you know,
random white dudes like Ken, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in Humboldt and stuff,
you know, humble cobalo different places
[SPEAKER_01]: in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of resentment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: White people did not treat the natives
that were living in the valleys very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, he basically, he had to make
up a story and whenever you make up a
[SPEAKER_01]: story, sometimes the details change,
you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes or no, not so I'll ask you since
you're from the area, Ken Estes,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes or no, Mark Emory, many, no,
uh, only because, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, he just, he basically like,
there was, it was more than just Ken,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he does, you know, he just took it
down to the third floor and it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was one of those guys that was willing
to, there was not that many people from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo and Humboldt that were willing to go
into those dispensaries and funnel weed
[SPEAKER_01]: into them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People wanted to be anonymous and he was
willing to be not anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of that, he got his name
attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a really good song on YouTube
called leave Ken alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot who the rapper is in it,
but it's all about Ken getting popped and
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving and leave him alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do description in maybe,
in maybe Ken's defense, just, just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think this, you could apply this
to almost anyone that, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: gets famous around weed is they get famous
and they get known for a particular story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, it becomes more of
maintaining their image than being honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that temptation is a really big
temptation and we could talk about lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different people in the industry where,
you know, there's like not very well known
[SPEAKER_01]: details that are true, but you know,
they have a narrative and they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: public persona and their interest is
maintaining that public persona.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I saw this in the UFO world a
lot too, where people would be like famous
[SPEAKER_02]: for, let's say they claimed to have an
abduction or a UFO sighting and they'd get
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of acclaim for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they did see something they
found to be anomalous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe these were, they were being totally
true or honest at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that attention goes away and all
the adoration and admiration from people
[SPEAKER_02]: and the, you're so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the recognition, they slowly get this
want need to get those endorphins or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the admiration flowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll make it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll, they'll force it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll force that whatever it is and take
that reputation shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see that in weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It transfers over so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some people catch lightning in a
bottle once and they spend the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: their life, like trying to just chasing
that dragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Force that hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just looks pathetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thirsty ego is what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or people make entire seed companies just
based around the one or two things that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're famous for and only do variations
around those things because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're known for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, you were talking,
we, I don't know if it was Matt or you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like you were talking about the train
wreck name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I heard, you know, wasn't there
rumors that like the E 32 it was because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like the 32nd generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something like a 30 second attempt
to, to re repro the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something, something wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: H and L wasn't that a crew that you 32
crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it was a group,
but I remember that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that term coming out on the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, no, you don't have train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have the arcade cut the E 32 cut is
the one I remember Calio Calio is a part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the E 32.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like an early DHK type thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know one person who'd know I kind of bug
him about that mask, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know it was that was it Berkeley
patients group that Eric Arcata?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was his name on the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like A E R I C.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was, it was Arcata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the dispensary was it opened up,
I think off of H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: BPG was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 11, there was a club, like one of the
first clubs that opened up in Arcata was
[SPEAKER_00]: off of 11th street.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude Eric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was a Calio story from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does predate him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he is the cut that goes around is from
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly, and I'm sure
someone will correct me if I get that
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong, but yeah, the E 32.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the cut that goes around that
everybody has came by him and was passed
[SPEAKER_02]: out by that collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the a hundred percent original and
nobody has, yeah, not the rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was pretty extensively has done
his research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows that story about the,
I've never seen the E 32 cut though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I haven't put it up against the
one that I've held onto, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys, I think it's that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the same cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just, you know, seen the forum hype
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that was out of there from
Eric.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that's the one that
everybody has or that has it now or that
[SPEAKER_02]: had it back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hard to, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the one that CSI has then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you that I'll tell you
that my cut didn't come from him directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my cut from the boys up in the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the story, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come 2000, uh, you know, we're all into
clones and we're not popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, my, my roommate, uh, partner at
the time, uh, knew this girl in Arcata
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, she was real, uh, you know,
a cute little kid or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of ditsy and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked her for some cuts and she's
like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone's helping me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She runs up into the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it was up in Neeland area
and, uh, got up, got a flat of T-dub
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it down and didn't tell them that
she wasn't getting it for her own readup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ended up giving it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my first introduction to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't even seen it prior to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the years, uh, a couple of years
before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're growing this thing and then
come, come to find out she's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: hawked by these cats all of a sudden,
because she wasn't supposed to let that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking thing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly the same time that
Arcata, we didn't call Arcata Trenric
[SPEAKER_00]: then, but Trenric started getting really
prolific in Arcata and it was fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you couldn't get away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then not too long, you know,
two, three years into that, all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden people were bringing their cuts in
and bringing their, their work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, you know, rare, you know,
you had 10 people line it up and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: rare that you've got that original,
uh, you know, plant a cut from that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I think because of like the tuck
seed lines, the wood horse seed lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally got ahold of a wood horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk to him finally for an
interview, which would be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, um, yeah, he was responsible for
a lot of the train wreck out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That head seed never grateful head H and
O.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did, um, Oriental express, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but who, um, God, who else did
something with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did an oral.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We at least did the Oriental express to do
a public service announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, don't name your seed line after a
famous cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't, please don't pick a
different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we've never seen the same SFV
OG cut after swerve release that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we see that, don't name it,
don't name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exact cut name, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: God or Larry or Tahoe are all kind of just
like up in the air on, if you ever see
[SPEAKER_02]: those cuts again, that they'll ever be
anything like they were originally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause so many seeds were sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under those exact names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes, it makes it hard, you know,
and, uh, I will say that the Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_00]: reg is not from Santa Cruz, by the way,
but that, that's super common too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Matt and I were chatting about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you got snow and Humboldt,
it was Humboldt snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got it, it was Oregon snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a new gene, it was Eugene snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you got it in Baker, so there's
Baker's field snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's, yeah, that's a different
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, people would get it
and they would change the name and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would bring it to different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like names have always been very,
uh, very odd part of the history.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I found out about a local strain
here that I never heard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's actually a city in the mountains
45 minutes from here, but it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very close and it's called the
Tehachapi terror.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found it in a magazine from the
seventies and I know nothing else about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but yeah, it sounded so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tehachapi terror.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody know like, what is the blue
dream origin story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we've gone over, like not knowing
what train wreck is, what is blue dreams
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard, I've heard a few different
theories.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't blue dream wasn't in my world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we were, we had green track and train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue dream wasn't as big out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only stuff I saw, you know,
was flown in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that specific cut was first given to me
by Bodhi and the people who kind of were
[SPEAKER_02]: around the Santa Cruz area that knew the
crowd that was giving it out or where it
[SPEAKER_02]: came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: All said it was 98 blueberry from DJ that
specific cut that he would pass around
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed a super specifically a super
silver haze from greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only know of one company that ever
released that specific cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it came after or
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things, chicken before
the egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the blue hen from, um,
bluegrass seeds, Kentucky seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a blue hen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember seeing pictures of both in
the Canada Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure which came first on that,
but they were both similar type plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'd imagine you could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if they were both using similar lines
to make them, I would imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the only variation I would add
to the, that I've heard is, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, uh, haze that people refer to as a
Santa Cruz haze being, being that cut that
[SPEAKER_00]: was, uh, used with the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have yet to see the Santa Cruz haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is just a myth or if
it's, I would, I would almost bet my left
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, that it would be a super silver
haze based on the, the turf profile and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be pretty, pretty dead on,
especially because of how quickly it
[SPEAKER_02]: finishes still all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Johnny blaze, I think was,
uh, yeah, it was legends needs Neville's
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that one took a little bit longer and
it still got kind of big like Neville's,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, I could definitely see super silver
haze being the, the father pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember if I remember correctly,
I think super silver haze got dropped as a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed line in 97.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it won three cups in a row in,
in, uh, in the cannabis cups in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I believe it was like 97,
98, 99, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was 96, but it was something
along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about like old song, super silver
haze cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I crossed that to the DJ's cut
DJ's mom, the blueberry that he sold when
[SPEAKER_02]: he was going around giving lectures and
stuff, if I cross those two, I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: sure I could nail that thing pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would, it would be pretty regular
occurring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I could see how that could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, one thing I'll interject is
that at the little gathering that we just
[SPEAKER_01]: had, um, one of the favorite things I
smoked was, uh, a hybrid pack made that
[SPEAKER_01]: was a blue dream by train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the, one of the things I'll say
about it is that I think turpentine has a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of depth to it, but it's so forward
and strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it overpowers a lot of people and
that blue dream hybrid with train wreck,
[SPEAKER_01]: that blue dream brought like a sweetness
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That almost like took like the,
the edge off that train wreck flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, but the, the flavor of train
wreck was still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't like the predominant knock
you just took a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like a sweetness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like with cooking where like
you add some acidity or you add some,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you had something to balance out
your sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had that brightness come through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the brightness for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, uh, we joke a lot that
like, once you get turpentine in
[SPEAKER_01]: something, it's really fucking hard to get
it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I didn't think anything could
tame, uh, the train wreck nose so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that hybrid, it really allowed the
turpentine to shine because it gave it a
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did a review on the blue dream
train wreck in a previous episode in a
[SPEAKER_02]: short episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check that out if you're interested,
but yeah, I was, I was really impressed
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was two, two things I was very
familiar with and they combined really
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that surprised a lot of people and
may have been, I think other than the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream, I think that was probably the one
that everybody gravitated to pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all luck, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but he still did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's luck with intention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came home from the party and I popped
some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the impression that
that's kind of the impression that it made
[SPEAKER_01]: where I just had to say that, uh,
it too old school, you know, pretty famous
[SPEAKER_01]: things, uh, that crossed really well
together.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the one thing that I,
that I, I appreciate that by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you guys appreciate that, you know,
your input with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say that the thing that I was
struck most with was, um, not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just T-dub taking a back step,
but then the train wreck comes through and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushes up the potency a little bit,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, both of those ended up
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, if you're not used to
smoking them and your body's not used to
[SPEAKER_00]: taking it in, they can both hit you pretty
hard in their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's, it was, it's nice to be able
to smoke both of the original parents side
[SPEAKER_00]: by side and then go over and hit,
hit that combination and see where it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of got enhanced or got pulled back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it was really, it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat to be able to watch my buddies,
you know, and partake with my friends in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of looking at that in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, getting that feedback,
you know, it was really kind of a special
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you smoke like 60 things in two
and a half days, uh, even just smelling
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you smell five or six things in a
row and you're like, your nostrils are
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of burned out for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, the quality of that, that hybrid
shown in my opinion, while we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about this stuff, let's talk about some of
the, the stuff we saw at the party and
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the different things that we,
uh, noticed didn't notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was your first time there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was your first time coming to the,
one of the gatherings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, maybe, maybe you guys,
I don't know which one of you wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: start, but talk about some of the screens
you saw, what you thought was the most
[SPEAKER_02]: unique, what you thought, uh, probably
bummed you out the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, as we were just talking
about it, talk stuff surprised me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, that, that one in
particular, um, just how the train wreck
[SPEAKER_04]: came through on some of his hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a backseat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown quite a few hybrids of train
rackets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally a variation on the theme,
you know, it's, it's train rack with a
[SPEAKER_04]: tiny bit of this or a tiny bit of that,
but you know, his hybrid seems really well
[SPEAKER_04]: blended.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one in particular, I really enjoyed,
um, uh, bidders grow of shoreline was
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and his, um, dog shit, uh,
elected Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of those are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was just a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, another one that really stood out to
me was the Death Star.
[SPEAKER_04]: The separate people, you know,
Panda brought some local brought some,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, and that had such a, it was a lot,
uh, rancor than I thought it'd be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost had like a Kim D rankness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, you know, in that level,
as far as potency, I would say,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was like, instead of being like
that nasty garbage, it was like nasty
[SPEAKER_04]: polyester.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, it's, it's hard to say,
but it was just, it was, it's very
[SPEAKER_04]: complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dug it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you pack?
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: It stood out, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's so much novelty
going around that it's hard to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: determine some from the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away by the Cobb just for the
five year old Cobb sitting there and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, Bode brought that through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat it
or smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought we were supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can, you can let me know how
that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bode told me who made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just stuck it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, my, I think that's probably what made
you sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it probably was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably knew exactly what I was going
to do with it and poisoned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I do with everything I get,
it just goes like, what else did you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I mean, honestly,
H&L jumped in before I could speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, you know, the, the electric
boogaloo amazing, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'll tell you what, uh,
that short line brought me back to my days
[SPEAKER_00]: in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just felt like, yeah,
man, I felt like it was 93 all over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a time capsule, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking so forward to growing that
too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but, uh, you know, one that,
one of the, one that threw me off guard
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wouldn't have gone and picked up,
um, on my own, but it happened to hit it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it, and somehow or another cut through
everything for me at that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember watching skid just laughing at
me, looking at me like, dude, you're stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that a, was that moon boat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he brought, and you know,
it could have been that I was on the 25th
[SPEAKER_00]: hour of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might've been four in the morning,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember where I was,
but I remember hitting that and just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of floating off into this like other place
for a while and, and, uh, feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: embarrassed because of, you know,
someone was laughing at me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it enough to put a picture up of
it on Instagram and post about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've gone, I've gone and revisited
it since because, you know, I was lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be able to bring some,
uh, party bags back and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not something that I would
necessarily have in my armory,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in terms of I want to grow this
and get into it, but I might, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might do that if I had the right cut,
but, um, that one stood out, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, our buddy Denali came
through some, some D, uh, some sour
[SPEAKER_00]: Denali, which, you know, to this day,
I'm still kind of just breaking little
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces off because the flavor is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought some silver D too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the silver D.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did that silver, you know, yeah,
the silver, that silver Fox.
[SPEAKER_04]: 21%, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 21% of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scientific silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I made a post about that by the
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, purple scientific chimed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how it should go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few other people chimed in and were
like, yeah, my machine has, isn't working
[SPEAKER_02]: for me like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe get turned it in,
get it tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, tell your friend
to, you know, get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: DM us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I DM them and they said, it's not mine,
but I'll, I'll be happy to talk to the
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you told me to DM you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, no, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And left it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, that thing was, we all saw
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody there sat around and
watched this thing nail 21% on just
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I just got one more
shot out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more shot out if I can, uh,
to CB, uh, to our buddy crybaby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and some of the magic that he
weaves, uh, our friend Panda came down
[SPEAKER_00]: from way up North with an Arctic,
uh, made the trip down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, uh, another friend of our
ring, our friend of our rings grew out the
[SPEAKER_00]: meteora for, yeah, that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brought that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, somebody had the,
uh, what is the BO, the burnt offering
[SPEAKER_00]: next to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a, I guess a grandchild of the,
uh, meteora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice to have those side-by-side
because, um, you know, just smoking that
[SPEAKER_00]: for an offering a couple of months back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was like, wow, this is very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something you usually get,
um, often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, having that next to the meteora
for it, seeing that kind of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: relation between the two, those,
those pretty interesting for me to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that definitely sticks out in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meteora for was probably my favorite,
like, uh, what would be traditionally
[SPEAKER_02]: considered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativa leaning type there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was definitely my favorite out of all
of them in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so, what about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a different tact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in that, uh, my favorite part of
the gathering was the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say that is because,
you know, when, when we threw these
[SPEAKER_01]: parties earlier, they were kind of based
around the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was sort of like a wedding party.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of a way for heads and
friends to gather after the sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: the big, the big gathering itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and this time was different in that it
was intentional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was friends that mostly talk
online to each other coming from,
[SPEAKER_01]: in some cases, literally all over America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from the far East, from the far
North, from, you know, people spend a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of time and energy to make sure that they
could come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I really think it was no
joke getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was no joke once they hit the airport
to get to where the party was,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that like, you know,
especially with COVID and stuff and people
[SPEAKER_01]: being trapped in their houses and being
able to spend a lot of time online,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make some really good friends,
but I do think it really helps to spend a
[SPEAKER_01]: few days like breaking bread with someone,
getting baked with them, eating food,
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, one of my, I mean,
one of my, one of my favorite muscles
[SPEAKER_01]: loved in, you know, one of my favorite
things about the event is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, our, our homie who's a bitter,
uh, you know, he gets up at like four 30
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fucking morning or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he starts tough and whenever I go
to one of these events, I wake up and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just hear his laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to bitter and his wife for
holding it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this, there was this memory I
had where I got up in the morning and a
[SPEAKER_01]: bitter was on like his like 12th joint or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was just a tent on trying all
this shit and high and lonesome had just
[SPEAKER_01]: woke up and bitter handed him this joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a chem D joint laced with a
chem D Keith and high and lonesome took
[SPEAKER_01]: two, three hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, man, this is like,
this is not the starter mix for my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just, but, but you know,
faces to names, hearing people's voices,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to see people's sense of humor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's not typed out, but it's in real
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the internet is cool because
it brings, it can bring people together,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being able to spend time, I think,
and just, it was a, it's like a prop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a proper to me, like old school
harvest festival where you have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: real weed people sitting down,
making friends, talking shop, eating food,
[SPEAKER_01]: joking, sharing their passion basically,
you know, um, and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was enough of us there that each
brought some of our old favorites,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, that there was a lot of good favorites
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I'm not going to call them
out cause that would be rude or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember Panda telling me that one
of the guys that came brought like all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this, like new schools off, you know,
and after he smoked the shoreline and the
[SPEAKER_01]: electric boogaloo and some trends and this
and that he like took all his weed and he
[SPEAKER_01]: put it back in the bag because he was
like, man, you know, I don't even care
[SPEAKER_01]: about my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like this right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's neat because, you know,
we're all older now or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't realize that stuff that we
have a lot of experience with most new
[SPEAKER_01]: school smokers that have only been around
for eight or 10 years missed the era of
[SPEAKER_01]: almost everything that all four of us have
been talking about this entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You started smoking in like 2010,
2012, if you kind of got into the scene in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 10 or 15 years, um, you probably
didn't smoke real train wreck or real blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream or real green crack or what the hell
is trace dog or, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause we eat, it's like a flash in the
pan, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and so for me, you know,
there's lots of, there's lots of favorites
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, but, um, I just, I, I enjoy
spending time around people who share my
[SPEAKER_01]: interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from, aside from being able to get,
uh, to meet H&L in person, I say that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even, even on that, you know,
like, so I'm in the kitchen and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CSI and Bodie and H&L are all
talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they're like eating like,
you know, we're eating like smoked fish
[SPEAKER_01]: that Panda brought down from Alaska and
we're smoking weed from over here and H&L
[SPEAKER_01]: and Bodie and, and CSI have no need to
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was probably the first time they
met in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure was.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so even that, that kind of stuff
right there, I just think is super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, me and H&L have a company together
and that was the first time we've met.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I was like all, all,
all frantic as I came in the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was the last one there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I was driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was driving in the canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see for shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was taking forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I finally get there and we brought,
had to bring the dog because it's big and
[SPEAKER_02]: wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else going to take care of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to carry in like three rooms of
shit just for the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I am dead tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember walking by hugging someone
I thought was Panda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've seen pictures of Panda,
but I'd never met Panda hugging him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking I hug Panda, went downstairs,
came back upstairs and goes, where's my
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucker high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, all right, you already hug
me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: H&L had to go put a sticker on his chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden he started getting all
kinds of attention once he put that
[SPEAKER_00]: sticker on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from that, you know, seed swapping,
clone trading, talking about your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, getting to share your favorite
stuff with your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like watching local smoke P
91.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching the young and fucking smoking old
San Diego strain and like fall in love
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll throw this out there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is one of the things that I liked about a
dead tour was that you could be at a
[SPEAKER_01]: campsite, hanging out with people your
age, people in their thirties,
[SPEAKER_01]: people in their sixties, you know,
where a lot of, a lot of times you're
[SPEAKER_01]: really only hanging out with like your own
age group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had people there from their mid
twenties all the way up to their mid
[SPEAKER_01]: sixties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was probably a 40 year, you know,
I mean, probably like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Denali and his late, you know,
there was, there was some senior citizens
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some kids that were in our
opinion are barely out of their diapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and, and I remember,
you know, and some that are barely in
[SPEAKER_02]: their diapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Panda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking over at me and being like,
dude, I've never been to anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: this in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to soak people out like that is
one of the coolest things on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think I, I think I
stopped Matt once at one point and I
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at him and said, dude, this is one
of those moments in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite rare, uh, to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, don't, you know, just recognize,
I wasn't telling him to recognize,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you, Pat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think people taking their time and
their energy and money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flying and driving and prepping and
all the effort that went in to just have a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice time with friends for a weekend and
talk shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I can, I felt high,
honestly, like for days afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't, it was just, I just enjoyed
myself immensely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of positive intention for
being, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I think, uh,
I think that kind of like bonding with
[SPEAKER_01]: people in person is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Brynn has never been to one of our
gatherings before my chick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she went this time and like,
when we got home, she was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally get how you bonded with these
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, why you guys love each other as
much as you do and why you guys are so
[SPEAKER_02]: loyal and close.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, I love those dudes now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like they're family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell she's not in the room because
she didn't throw a shoe at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I'll tell you what, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I want to say about that is,
you know, the, the world that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: brought into, cause I didn't grow up in
the weed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I jumped into, you know, junior high,
high school kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, the, the old cats that I,
that brought me in under their wings,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the energy and that was the
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, there were people with
egos, of course, there's people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's nassals out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the, for the most part,
there was this cultural like consideration
[SPEAKER_00]: in this, this bigger picture that was
going on besides the plant and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: brings you together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a certain way, you know,
of, of kind of interacting with people
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that really kind of solidified that
era for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to fast forward 20 some odd
years and get a touch of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a taste of that again,
in a very unique kind of situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of brought back some,
some, some hope on my behalf, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm watching everything else fall
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not joining the big, the big,
I guess I'm not riding the wave or at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point I'm not, and it's not my thing,
but to know that that was still well on
[SPEAKER_00]: the live and all we had to do was,
you know, kind of let it unfold naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: and get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there were a lot of, a lot of
young guys, like not to said, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a huge age gap, but you know, we're all
weed people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all, you know, very much similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was great to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried to drive home, like in our,
our, our discord Patreon to like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that hang out there and the
breeder syndicate with us and talk stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and like, get really into the nerdy end of
stuff is like when they hear us talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: the can of Luminati, they like,
you know, they, they kind of first you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, is it like some underground?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you don't realize like it
was named as kind of like a tongue in
[SPEAKER_02]: cheek joke, just cause it was like,
it wasn't anybody who gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't any of the famous people that
you'd see in cannabis, like is the main
[SPEAKER_02]: faces.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't see Snoop Dogg here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't see Sherpin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't see any of those guys there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but what you did have was the most
passionate people in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I, that's all it's ever been
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with how long you've
been doing it as nothing to Matt,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing to do with how good you are at
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even that has to do with your passion,
your drive and like how intent you are to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to make this your, your passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's how we all found each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be on the same level as a
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had never met from halfway across the
world and you guys are walking the door
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's as if you knew each other your
whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think it, I definitely think
it strengthens some friendships,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the fact that it was pretty quick
either way, as far as the actual weed
[SPEAKER_01]: goes, since I pontificated a bunch about
like just like the human, the human
[SPEAKER_01]: element, you hit everybody feels super
clear that I think that the nineties and
[SPEAKER_01]: the early two thousands was sort of the
golden era of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most of my favorites are things
from that era, you know, the Kims,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cushions, the train wrecks,
the blue dreams, the shoreline,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, for my, for my age or whatever,
I just find most of that older weed hits
[SPEAKER_01]: me better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me a better effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's a wide variety of
effects, it's the rare weed that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: made in the last five or six years that
hits me like some of that older stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a bunch of friends bring
their personal favorites, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, we, he mentioned it,
but bitter brought, you know, two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three kinds, maybe four kinds of Kush
along with the electric Boogaloo along
[SPEAKER_01]: with the shoreline and then high and
lonesome had some Chem D and some,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some head and then fire Chem D by the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some, and some different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, a pack had,
uh, you know, train wreck and blue dream
[SPEAKER_02]: and classic the blue garlic train wreck
was a big hit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, there was, there was a
few different people that brought the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, the death star and,
and just, you know, and just different
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, you know, it eventually,
you know, at first I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I wonder if there's going to be enough
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, man, I wonder if
there's enough places to put all this weed
[SPEAKER_01]: because it like we kept moving tabletops
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, well, not so usually brings it
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like most of the parties it's,
it's been like 90% your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to bring me bringing a bunch
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was that way because, because I had
greenhouses and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if I'm like mono cropping,
I wouldn't say two things for the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have a 20 by 30 bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a bunch of headstache.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just me, you know, so the first
two, three parties we did, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, I probably brought pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like pounds of each individual
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably brought like, you know,
there was probably like four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of like, you know, total,
but it was like 35 different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no, I think it was like one to two
pounds of like 35 different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part of it is in a
commercial environment, just everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing, being super generous,
giving samples to all their friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CSI, uh, you know, dumped a
bunch of, uh, you know, various crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: he'd made on the ground so that anyone
could grab them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were exchanging seeds and
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I should shout out to,
I brought, you know, not everybody could
[SPEAKER_01]: do this because some people flew and
didn't drive, but yeah, I brought some
[SPEAKER_01]: mementos from my past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Matt brought a bunch of very cool,
um, magazines and old art and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, rare, rare, rare,
um, you know, catalogs of different things
[SPEAKER_01]: for people to look through and no one
stole anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not so good, but we, yeah,
not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so still, but that just, I think that
just ended up in my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the only other person that brought
books, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just ended up in my stuff,
but, but just, just a bunch of friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cooking and eating out and,
and smoking things and chatting and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the vibe too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it wasn't a competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't about who's got the biggest ego
or the biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, really kind of this,
this joining, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Hey, check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that makes a difference too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, honestly, we've talked about like,
do we want to make it like a cup event?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about it a few times between
a few of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I, I don't know,
man, would that change it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause even, even though it's all
really close friends as men were
[SPEAKER_02]: competitive, you know, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have like a prize or something
that we can all like argue over,
[SPEAKER_02]: like flex on it, even flex on each other
over, it just changes the vibe completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the hard thing too,
is when you have a party like that with
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that weed works, it's like a
snapshot in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was things, there was friends of
ours that couldn't come because of
[SPEAKER_01]: conflicts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was weed that was almost done that
couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was on the line, you know,
but not quite ready to be in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of like, what do I have
ready at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it was a little fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it was a little old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it was perfect, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what it was is it was mostly
just like, you know, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody brought stuff and it's like,
here's what I do for love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what I'm cropping right now to
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a variety of things that,
that incorporate all that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how better can it get,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was, I mean, the only thing,
my only complaint with it was that it
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to be like an extra two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I needed, I needed like a humidifier
and throat wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had it in a pretty, we had it in a
pretty dry mountainous part of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all the talking and smoking,
I was like a husk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sounded bad at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think all of us, most people I
talked to or heard their voice for three
[SPEAKER_00]: or four days afterwards were in the same
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a minute to recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to cry, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent this and I'll give a plug to the
company too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is that piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought it to the party and he sent it
out so we could use it at the party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a molten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they say it's the G Y Z R perk,
which it's just a few little holes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's probably my favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get like crap all in the lip,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the coolest things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the tornado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's called a tornado like ash
catcher thingy, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the other cool part was just,
I mean, I brought a, I brought a tube and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but there was a bunch of different
vapes, you know, not only that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just like smoking, smoking the way
people prefer to smoke, which can vary
[SPEAKER_01]: widely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local, local tried glass for his first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had only ever smoked out of joints or
blunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, bro, you have to try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, he was a changed man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he trained and then he tried the
rip and he was even more mind blown that
[SPEAKER_02]: that weed could taste like that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was funny with that old school
fucking vape box crew, like that method
[SPEAKER_01]: that we figured out with it or whatever,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then you just, and then what's
interesting about that is you smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint, a blue dream, or you, or you vape
blue dream, or you take a bong hit of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get different qualities.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not so, not so explain,
explain what that box was again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the box, it's like one of the it's
what's in the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so it's probably like one of the older
like vape devices that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably been around for a good 20
years or longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time and it's basically a
tapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got an interesting house here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes to make some noises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's beaten off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like a wooden box that has
like a glass element with a ceramic on it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can dial it in for how hot it
gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has like a, a glass mouthpiece
with the, a tube for lack of a better term
[SPEAKER_01]: that connects to another glass piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and most people would end up like
filling the glass, like really deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get one or two nice hits and
then it kind of tastes popcorny and it
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of loses its flavor and it's hard to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we figured out 20 years ago is if you
just grind up weed and you just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just use the mouthpiece and you just
suck up a little bit, just enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to like hoover up the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you put it to your mouth?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put it to your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke by putting things to my mouth and
inhaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how other people do it,
but that's my method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I inhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get you to pantomime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, uh, and so, you know,
if you, but if you just coat the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the screen with a little bit of weed,
yeah, you can get two or three really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: hits and then you can blow it out in a
little bit of water or a glass or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, it was really user friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That completely changed my rip deck too.
Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We the vape wares box, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vape wares and vapor brothers made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had vape where vapor brothers indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we smoked it a bunch and it kind of
fell in and out of favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we figured out how to do it
that way, there was like a couple of year
[SPEAKER_01]: period where like, that was the method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it any other way and you get really
clean turps that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get really like a really
good sense of like the profile of how the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's a little bit of a
different buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you get way higher in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, at least it's, it's, it's a noticeably
different high than smoking any other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gotta be because like the
volatile shit that would normally burn
[SPEAKER_02]: away right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're actually experiencing what it's
like to, you know, and then the other
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I'll say is that since everyone was
so generous with samples, I'm still
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking off samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought home and I got a much better
sense of a lot of the weed at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did at the party because when you're at
the party, once you've smoked 27 kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in eight hours through nine different
methods, you know, just look if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: what cuts through at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what cuts through, but it's
like, you know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, then it's like,
I can wake up and I can do some chores and
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take a couple hits of this and go do
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be like, Oh, it does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's got that kind of effect,
you know, like, Oh, it makes me want to
[SPEAKER_01]: sit down and do nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like Pac said with the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like it makes me want to move.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did any of you get to try the banana tie?
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit makes me want to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes my heart pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bit much for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the other part of it that
I, that I do like is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac used to live up in Humboldt and I do
think that like Humboldt and Mendo and
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, I call Santa Cruz, like the very
edge of the weird bubble, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this bubble that there's enough
weed people doing stuff around you that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's somewhat of a community,
you know, and we, we got some friends that
[SPEAKER_01]: came out from Illinois and from Alaska and
from here and from there that they're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like the only person like them in their
little community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was really, it was really nice
to see, especially some of the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, um, get to hang out with a bunch of
people like them of all age groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably for them, it was like
more memorable even for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if memorable would be the
correct term saying how we're all so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably not going to retain a lot
of the memories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, I remember fishing hook almost
hit me in the head a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just, just speaking of that
bubble, not so that you brought up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was telling each now a while
back, you know, one of the reasons why I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get on the farm back in the day is
because I, you know, I was in that network
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, the network that I,
that I had around me was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was kind of compartmentalized,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was the cruise down in Big Sur
and you had your Monterey cats,
[SPEAKER_00]: seaside guests, and you had your people
in, you know, Santa Cruz and Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I, I'd never had a need to go
outside of whatever the network was that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was working within in terms of trying to
reach out or find out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on with others or,
you know, growing techniques or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it wasn't, wouldn't have been
something that would have been helpful at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point, but because of my propensity
to not want to be on the radar whatsoever
[SPEAKER_00]: and even touch a computer and say anything
on there that had anything to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really compelled, at least in my
group to have to, you know, feel like I
[SPEAKER_00]: need some connection outside of what I'm
doing on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it wasn't really that kind of
lone wolf space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a lot of people, I think,
and HL could probably speak to this better
[SPEAKER_00]: than me, but a lot of people who weren't
so connected or had to be even more,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, discrete, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I weren't going to talk to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, that was a great place to be
able to make those connections and really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of figure out what was going on.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it was, uh, a whole different animal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you didn't, you knew two guys,
maybe in the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, you know, if you want it,
if you want it to be amongst people like
[SPEAKER_04]: you, you had to find them online because
you weren't talking to other people around
[SPEAKER_04]: you and doing the same thing, weren't
talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still, uh, still kind of like
that here, even with, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some version of legalization, it's,
um, it's still pretty, pretty closed lip,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least, you know, the people that have
been doing it a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're sort of like a very small
subset of a subculture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in a way, like we love weed for weed,
you know, um, is that the either,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the internet is a way for lots
of people that have sort of unusual
[SPEAKER_01]: interests to find each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, from all kinds of walks of
life, you know, that are bathroom stalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only have two choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in, you know, so they,
uh, indeed right off the bathroom stall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, I, I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, it's, it's that, you know,
even in met people think I get it all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time where people think that Mendo or
Humboldt is something that it isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: because they, you know, they think of it
as like this weed Mecca, which it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: is, but it also has all these elements
that like, you wouldn't really get unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you live there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I, but, you know, just,
you know, sharing time and energy with
[SPEAKER_01]: like-minded individuals, I think is a good
thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I too, I was scared of the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, especially when heaven stairway and,
uh, and cannabis world and, and over girl
[SPEAKER_01]: all got shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't very tech savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got worried that like everything I
didn't said would be permanently there
[SPEAKER_01]: that they could find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit, it was past green
merchant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was definitely paving the way
more like 1990.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was like probably, I don't think,
I think those busts happened until like
[SPEAKER_01]: three or four, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I didn't like when with high and
lonesome being on IC mag and all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I worked in that era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I just basically like you were on
someone else's computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, I was in Norca Lake County
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was kind of a booming time
for my area for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Matt, we didn't get you partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was, what was, what was the standout
or standouts for you, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, of course, a blue dream just cause
like I, it's a classic for me because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: such a blueberry head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, that's that, that's what I,
I pull to, um, let's see, like the main
[SPEAKER_02]: standouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know everybody was stoked on the
shoreline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to try that one because I was
so busy trying everything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's the one I remember everybody
being real stoked on and hearing about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I liked Caleb's flight plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's called flight risk or flight plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flight risk, flight risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes more sense than flight plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was, he had one called,
um, the, the blackberry wine 69.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really unique and tasted and
smelled like wine, like Chardonnay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was the, the, uh, sweet 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say, yeah, that was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from the pinks and perps like the
blackberry widow hybrid Mendo perps type
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept going back to that jar as a matter
of fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was so much stuff there that it was
just ridiculous to try to go through it
[SPEAKER_02]: all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got home, I didn't try the Death
Star much while I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got home, I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, P 91, I finally got to try
when I got home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that was really good,
really good grow of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, God, and it didn't always silver
Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never get enough of silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never had outdoor silver Pearl
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually had a pretty, pretty
strong high for silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_04]: 21%.
[SPEAKER_04]: 21%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I dug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bag of that silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was smoked on the other night and it
looked like something Denali put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backyard victory garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so he gets to do a bunch of
favorites and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, he had, he had a,
I gave him, uh, my sour diesel cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a pretty nice example of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I didn't even get to try
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a hard one outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the flavor varies a lot outdoor,
but the potency is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I take that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get to try that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent it to me beforehand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it really good outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wow, this actually is really
good sour at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I don't know if this is good or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, it's actually coming
through in the outdoor as great smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour so variable outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I feel like the high normal
is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the flavor and the looks,
you know, for me are very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a long time high in lonesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really need a good season in order
to get it to express, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you really need that last two
weeks to be banging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It likes to go towards Halloween ish or
even early November ish at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't always get that weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even in Mendo sometimes, you know,
it just depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you get real nice, warm,
dry falls and other times it's rainy and
[SPEAKER_01]: cloudy and problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my phone's about to die, Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to, yeah, we're almost at
two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll touch on the 420 sale real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a sale coming up on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some freebies from high in
lonesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the freebies you're going to be?
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the mule skinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is GMO cross to Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Goat Farm is going to be a part of it
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's going to be the freebies with
your stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to throw in,
maybe we're going to do that Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess I'm called Hell Melon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell Melon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a watermelon Skittles hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watermelon Skittles hybrid crossed with an
F3 Angelica, which is one of Bodhi's cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A buddy of mine had been working on that
for quite some time around here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Angelica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it to a nice spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have a few things from
both of those gentlemen and we'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: having a big percentage off and I'll be
throwing in some other freebies too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be letting everybody know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Molten Glass again for this
awesome glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is my favorite piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shout out to Crybaby for hooking it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wish you would have been there this
year, but you weren't, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just like to throw in that
when Matt convinced me to start chatting
[SPEAKER_01]: in public, we kind of wanted to bring real
weed talk without so much promotion into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody on this chat today is my
very good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anytime I get to chat with my
homies, it's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm super glad that High and
Lonesome and Pac and all of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got to chat for the last couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That damn time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, everybody on this podcast
today is my really good friend and I
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate them a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So likewise.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any closing thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my closing thought was this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to be pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know you got one?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, the positive vibes coming from
not so pretty much covers it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we all do this for the love of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just great to see like minded
folks out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, just stuck to be part of a
good group of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sharing a similar philosophy that goes
beyond just chasing the dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: To to know that that's well and alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and you got some merch
coming out soon, too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we're always in the lab
doing something around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I would say keep your eye out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if anyone does
follow on Instagram or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a tendency to kind of post some
things that I'll be working with maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for me to get an idea as to
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of the vetting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're wondering what might be
coming down the pipe here in the next six
[SPEAKER_00]: months to a year or shorter, you know,
there's some good things in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that shoreline is on the
shoreline and the green crack is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe maybe some blue dream
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And collabs with you in a high and
lonesome in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I hope I think in the books.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I think it's on the radar.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, you know, I'm just stoked to
watch my good buddies want to grow some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit I've been putting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: HL is, you know, going to be popping some
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things are starting to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm just thankful to be part
of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's, you know, you create you
not so create something really unique
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I personally have I grew up reading
like high and lonesome stuff, like on the
[SPEAKER_02]: forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do becoming going from being like an
admirer to one of my best friends has been
[SPEAKER_02]: a huge honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same with you back learning you
learning, learning who you are and who you
[SPEAKER_02]: are behind like your Instagram person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the person behind that and and how
you're involved and stuff has been pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty been really cool getting to
introduce you to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they get to learn your story to
slowly, slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully everybody else will over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see how it goes.
