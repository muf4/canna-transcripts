[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_02]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_02]: seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both Valzen and myself are big advocates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of women in our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also big advocates of them
telling their truths, their true stories,
[SPEAKER_02]: their adventures in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not always going to be a
beautiful, pretty picture, especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: women talk about their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trigger warning here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't normally do anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any kind of trigger warnings or anything
PC, but in this case, like it is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those things that I know there are some
women that it has so much PTSD,
[SPEAKER_02]: they cannot even stand hearing about it
because it triggers them too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this thousand says peach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to put a disclaimer in here
at the very beginning that there may be
[SPEAKER_02]: some uncomfortable parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll only be brief.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's your choice if you want to
listen or not to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, we hope you enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, Riot Seeds, here with
Thousandfold, my co-host.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we will be talking to
SweetPeachKiss13.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so SweetPeachKiss13, head of Pure
Organic Medicinals and founder of GI Mary
[SPEAKER_04]: Jane's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Peaches, as we'll refer to her in
short, is one of our Discord community
[SPEAKER_04]: members.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peaches, alongside her husband
Buckshot Hill, have been a great duo in
[SPEAKER_04]: the Discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think recently, Matt, you got to
meet up with them and hang out a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit, which is really sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a blast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a blast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like, man, you had a couple of
weeks of like... Didn't you meet...
[SPEAKER_04]: Denali.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you had a series of like double
dates, I felt like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Spindle and his wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like getting to meet people for
the first time from our group is real fun
[SPEAKER_02]: because like you never know what you're
gonna get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the time, it's been,
especially with the couples that I've met,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna be lifelong friends for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Peaches, like I mentioned,
one of the main reasons why we have
[SPEAKER_04]: Peaches on the show today is actually to
talk hash making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not the only thing that Peaches
does.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just what we're gonna call the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll get into some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Peaches, what were some of your
earliest experiences with the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to be perfectly honest, even though
I come from a third generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a third generation grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandpa grew and my dad grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never messed with weed as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents were very strict.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time I touched weed as a kid was
when I took it from my dad and I put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: a bologna sandwich in a lunch bag and I
gave it to my boyfriend at school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got caught with it and we got
trouble and I got my ass beat for that
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drawing attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I drew attention to us in not a very
good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got in trouble for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I never smoked weed until I
graduated and got out on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, unfortunately, the first weed I
ever did really smoke was some Mexican
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I met Buckshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buckshot had his own weed that he was
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some bag seed from as he's a Rasta
lady and a Subaru in Humboldt is where he
[SPEAKER_01]: got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was purple weed and he got bag seed
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, he named it the super
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was growing that when we got
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my first experience seeing a
plant or getting to smoke actually really
[SPEAKER_01]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my real first experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what in 1996 when we first
met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, yeah, my dad never showed me his
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandpa didn't show me his plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't our family wasn't like really
out there about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandpa grew weed to give my mom
because my mom was diagnosed with breast
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she was going to L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: for chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my grandpa grew the weed that my mom
took to L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: to hustle, to pay for her hotel and to go
to chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my grandma also hustled weed to
help pay for my mom's stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gangster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then my dad grew weed, you know,
just for himself, because my mom passed
[SPEAKER_01]: away when I was four.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't make it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I wish so much that she
had known that that same weed she was
[SPEAKER_01]: selling that she could have used herself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help treat what she had for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she didn't have a clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my dad, you know, my dad's been the
black sheep of the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got busted and raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that very specifically that day
having the cops come down the driveway and
[SPEAKER_01]: like trying to figure out why are all the
cops here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sat us down on the couch and they
told us to stay there and they searched
[SPEAKER_01]: our whole house and they took all my dad's
weed and they took all his plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my dad was their motorcycle mechanic
because it's a small town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they didn't take him to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just took everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: They taxed him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were saying that you never saw a plant
when you were growing up?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew them down in the creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's told me stories about how he grew
them tucked under the willow trees in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sand so they didn't have to be watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all that stuff,
you know, he smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could smell it come out of the
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, they just it wasn't like
how I am with my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my kids know all about the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They help.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like that for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I noticed that a lot of parents
that were growers and had kids either were
[SPEAKER_02]: very permissive, wanted to involve in it
and educate them or be silent about it
[SPEAKER_02]: because they had to be mindful of that
mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their kids could potentially tell the
wrong person at school and bring down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's not a lot of in
between between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going to mention where where
Peaches is from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it typical California?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually very woodsy and beautiful
Sequoia area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be a lot of creeks,
a lot of mountains, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it mountainous?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very mountainous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 40 acres that backed up to the
National Forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a whole big creek that ran
right through our property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guerrilla growing was like quite a,
I don't know, natural decision,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, given that kind of terrain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your family has had this quite long and
intense relationship with the plot in all
[SPEAKER_04]: these different ways.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably come back to some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what were some of the first because
the show is going to be centered on
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to ask what were the first
extracts you tried?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that would be some dry sift that we
did in the in the back bedroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably in like in 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: He showed me by taking he put the flour in
a sifter that just like the sifter I use
[SPEAKER_01]: to sift the hash out of it comes out of
the freezer now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he put flour in there and he had one
of the glass, the glass pieces from one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow lights and put it at an angle and
then had a piece of paper at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: shook it over the glass and it would go
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the THC would stick to the glass
and everything else would go to the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would take a card and card
that up and we would use that on joints
[SPEAKER_01]: and bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that technically was the very first
extract.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've never heard of that,
but that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He developed that when he was 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was the first time he showed
me how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the first time I actually made
ice water hash was in 1999.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought the first set of the one gallon
bubble bags from the OCBC and Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that is that bubble band?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakland is a was a bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out bubble man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were one gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and actually what's crazy is the first
strand we washed and made hash with was
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it make good hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't make very good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the berries stick with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I couldn't tell you specifically
if you asked Buckshot that he could
[SPEAKER_01]: probably tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably would remember, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: He would.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the original bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Sacred Matha from Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just blanked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had another question, which was what was
your how did you see hash relative to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking flour at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember it used to knock me on my
ass because I was a hell of a lightweight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had we had just had our daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was still in that hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't smoke during mom time,
you know, nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a time to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I you know, for me, the hash was like a
nighttime thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I but I love flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flour is still one of my favorite things
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as I like to make cash,
there's nothing like good flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hash for me back then was just it
was like nighttime smoke and get the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And normally what you would just.
[SPEAKER_04]: Add it to a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like, you know, the snake in the
grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we used to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call them hash holes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the snake in the grass or we
would do the on top of a bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, classic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to round out this little
icebreaker introduction, would you please
[SPEAKER_04]: tell us about, first of all, pure organic
medicinals and then GI Mary Jane's just to
[SPEAKER_04]: let the audience know like, you know,
what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll start with GI Mary James
because that came first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 2018, we got involved with Battle
Buds, who was associated with the Weed for
[SPEAKER_01]: Warrior project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we became a sponsor for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was men and women combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would come together and, you know,
have like a day where they did food and
[SPEAKER_01]: hung out and they had weed and a giveaway
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I noticed there was women there
and a lot of the women just congregated
[SPEAKER_01]: alone together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I thought of starting GI
Mary James, which would be the same
[SPEAKER_01]: concept that the Battle Buds was based off
of, which was a veteran group,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was going to be for just women
veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the women veterans could come together
and have a safe place to meet where there
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't men, because a lot of women
veterans have, you know, been assaulted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have dealt with a lot of shit from
men.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my intuition when I saw the group
interaction was that these women needed a
[SPEAKER_01]: safe place of their own to do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that they weren't having fun,
but I wanted to help provide them with
[SPEAKER_01]: that same aspect by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started doing that and it was
going really well until COVID happened and
[SPEAKER_01]: we lost our meeting spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we haven't been able to have
meetings anymore until I can find
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere that will let us come and,
you know, smoke and hang out and do all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask as well, were you just to just
to be clear, were you ever in the military
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself or?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad is an ex-marine.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandpa was a World War II prisoner of
war.
[SPEAKER_01]: My uncle was a Navy veteran from Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up around the veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, the only, I mean,
I know a lot of people always say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I would have joined, but my grandpa
asked me not to join the military.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually in the process of trying to
sign up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came to me and asked me to not
join.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no, I would not do that to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my grandpa was my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandma and grandpa raised me pretty
much after my mom died and my dad fell
[SPEAKER_01]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched my grandpa struggle every
day with PTSD and the stuff that happened
[SPEAKER_01]: to him as a prisoner of war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me have a lot of compassion
for veterans and what they experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was just something that was dear
to my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw these people struggling and
cannabis was helping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just chose to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like that's super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very smart to have a space like that
for women because that does happen a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends that have been through
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not the most comfortable
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Military unions and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's very laudable what you've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super cool work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing the good work, as people might say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure again, we'll come back to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Pure Organic Medicinals?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they found me on Instagram about,
I don't know, four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I refer to us as a band of
misfits because we are not corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we haven't hit the market yet
because it's been six years for everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved for three years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I brought to the table was my
hash experience, my edible experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then all the equipment that we had
acquired over the last few years is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: making their hash room run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two main guys who have been in
cannabis their whole lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to come to market
with... We have a solvent-less license and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: For someone like me who's not really close
in any way to the American legal market or
[SPEAKER_04]: license side of things, what do you mean
when you say you haven't got to market
[SPEAKER_04]: yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what does it mean that... What's
been happening in this whole time?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're jumping through hoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all the testing that has to be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to find a distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Considering the fact that there's only
three of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last month, I've had to wash by
myself, probably like 150 pounds of weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: five pounds at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that has to go for pre-testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got to package it and then
it's got to go to distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes through another round of
testing and then it can actually go to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to...
[SPEAKER_04]: Signpost for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is already after you've gotten your
license, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is already post-licensing and you're
still having to do basically more
[SPEAKER_04]: compliance stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they come every year and do
an inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's anything that's not
perfect, then you have to fix that and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do this and change that and all
that wonderful stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being not corporate is kind of a major
boon because it cuts you off from a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been our biggest holdup.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I know everybody thinks I'm like,
woohoo, you're a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't usually get paid when I come up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have literally... I've gotten paid a few
times when they've had money from our few
[SPEAKER_01]: investors that we've gotten, but most of
the time I come up and I work on my own
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to...
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to build a legacy for my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: My son, Tyner, he's going to be the fourth
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know.
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter, she's grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't want to do anything with the
weed world, but that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's her choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's doing great out in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, this is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to create a legacy for him that is
legal, that he doesn't have to worry and
[SPEAKER_01]: be scared about going to jail and having
the cops kick down our door and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that we've worried about our whole
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so funding has been our biggest
hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had to literally stop what we're
doing and wait to try to conjure up some
[SPEAKER_01]: money here or there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the guys went back to work full
time to get another job just to help pay
[SPEAKER_01]: for the mortgage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all the glam and glitz that a lot
of people think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard work and they don't make
it easy, especially if you're not a rich
[SPEAKER_01]: millionaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's on the market now that is
legacy, you can guarantee those people
[SPEAKER_01]: have worked their asses off to get where
they're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also the added cost of
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each time you bring in a new strain,
each different way you extract it has to
[SPEAKER_02]: be tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: That costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people just assume that that's
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheap, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every COA is $475.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for every metric ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wash 10 pounds of runs, that's a
metric ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have something else, that's another
metric ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I take that runs and I put it
in live rosin, that has to be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I take that same runs and I put it
in a cart, that cart still has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: tested separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I take that and put it into an
edible, that has to have separate testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just test what I made once and
put it into three products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically every point of the production
chain almost or the supply chain needs to
[SPEAKER_04]: be tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time it enters into a new product
and form, if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has to have a COA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess just another reminder or
insight into the fact that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially still very much pay to win or
pay to play, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really need to be able to either
sacrifice enough or afford what is an
[SPEAKER_04]: immense cost to get going.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stepping away from some of that,
what you called it, jumping through hoops
[SPEAKER_04]: and going back to the hash for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I wanted to ask you about was
how you see your process having developed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You told us about some of the very first,
quote unquote, extract or hash that you
[SPEAKER_04]: made.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did this journey go for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, just developing yourself as
someone who's doing hash at home and then
[SPEAKER_04]: transitioning into this bigger scale,
it's more commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always done our own personal thing
for friends and family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can just start there first then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just start with what was it like making
hash for your friends and family?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a one gallon bucket on the kitchen
counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would do it an ounce at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of our best washers at the
time was the LA confidential that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always washed well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Buckshot got hurt way early in our
relationship with his back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's been basically the stay at home,
take care of the things at the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I've been out working and handling
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, I was in nursing school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finished my pre-wrecks and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got my associate's degree in
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to go to RN school for the
rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and I was going to sign up for RN
school and I went to the meeting and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, do you work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, I'm a full-time CNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work 40 plus hours a week as a CNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was like, well, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, well, go to RN school.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be in school full-time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to quit your job and
go to school because there's no way you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't quit my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't support us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are realistic American choices now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was no joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gone through all my financial aid
for all the pre-wrecks I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had nothing left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, his mom had given us 10 grand
because she was like, put this towards
[SPEAKER_01]: nursing school, do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, I can't live off this
long enough to go to nursing school
[SPEAKER_01]: because that was my first thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buckshot took it and invested in the clear
class and learned how to do distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when he did that, they were supposed
to give him a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to get a job doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I could go to school to be an RN and
we would be okay because once I was done,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be able to support us and we'd be
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't have to struggle anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Nate Amber gave him a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sold him some CBD distillate and
taught him how to do all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: took his money, and then never gave him a
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were sitting here and he was already
into the rosin and learning all that and
[SPEAKER_01]: had the first Sasquatch M1 press.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this happened, I was like,
what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't go to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I've always done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always made good edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, I used to make edibles
for the Visalia medical clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to put everything into hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought a freeze dryer and we bought the
bags and we started with the Bruteless
[SPEAKER_01]: Trash Cans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally washed hash in our kitchen on
scaffolding on a ladder, standing on a
[SPEAKER_01]: ladder to wash hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually has proof of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we started with the white
Bruteless Trash Cans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the ice extract bags and a freeze
dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started there and then we started to do
the sashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It honestly just took off from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean by the sashes?
[SPEAKER_01]: The secret sesh where the black market
companies come together in some rented
[SPEAKER_01]: secret location and we set up a table and
they let people come in and they get to
[SPEAKER_01]: shop, like a farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a blast because you got to meet
like-minded people and become a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the community and then we were helping
people again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did want to dip into the tech a bit more
at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up until this point of scaling up,
when you're still dealing with the one
[SPEAKER_04]: gallon bags and whatnot, in that early
era, what did you learn, do you think,
[SPEAKER_04]: about making hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, back then, I didn't learn as
much as I did once we got the bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment because there wasn't as much
information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't ones to be on the internet very
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a question I did want to
ask at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get that information to start
making hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you learn that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That came from Buckshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a research powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed has been his life forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had read, I'm pretty sure, some
information from Neville about hash
[SPEAKER_01]: making.
[SPEAKER_01]: That had piqued his interest and that's
when we got the one gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest part I think about that point
was learning how to dry it right because
[SPEAKER_01]: there was no freeze dryers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would wash it through the little bags
and then when the kit, you got these
[SPEAKER_01]: little screens, they're orange and blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would put that on top of a piece of
cardboard and then put the hash on it so
[SPEAKER_01]: it would draw it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you keep it in the fridge,
it helps the whole process and does all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably the biggest learning
curve at that point was just learning how
[SPEAKER_01]: to dry it right so that you wouldn't get
it moldy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about, like I said
earlier, I'm not very advanced at all in
[SPEAKER_04]: hash making, but I have heard that the
drying part is really, really key.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hardest part when I was learning how to
use bubble bags and stuff, I was teaching
[SPEAKER_02]: myself because the information was out
there at that point, but I just was
[SPEAKER_02]: stubborn and figured, well, I just see how
people do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just stir it with some ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No big deal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just pull up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was taking dry leaves that would crumble
up and crush up, just stuffing it all in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, getting a full drill with a painter
paddle on drill speed and you just go
[SPEAKER_02]: brrrr for 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that did not make a exceptional
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some of the worst shit ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is to do with preparation too,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Big part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned about because we do leaf and we
have done leaf, but most of the time we
[SPEAKER_01]: like to wash flower because it just gives
you better results.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we did learn back then
was about making sure you froze it first,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it was dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it just helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the point that Matt was making,
the other variable that I see people
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously needing to control to some
degree is how much agitation are you
[SPEAKER_04]: actually introducing?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's obviously a sweet spot,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to move something around,
but not too much or you're going to start
[SPEAKER_04]: breaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drill speed is a little much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep in mind that every time a
leaf breaks in there, it releases
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you release chlorophyll, that's when
you get the green slime.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have to wash hard enough that you
push the water through the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how a river rushes through a canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want the water to do so
it'll rush through there and break the
[SPEAKER_01]: heads off and carry them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be too gentle, but you got to
not be too rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a 20 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means I'm washing five pounds of
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With 20 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is I do a 10 minute wash and
then I let it settle for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I do so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every wash I do is a 10 minute wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've found that's a pretty nice sweet spot
where for one, your arms will get tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, it seems to be a good amount of
agitation without breaking it up too much
[SPEAKER_01]: and totally disintegrating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something people as a wash hash,
you'll have to learn how hard to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can see my videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put some good work into it, but you're
trying to ... I don't know how many pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: of water and weed in there that you're
trying to get all the heads off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you normally grind the weed up before
you start or just put it in full bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if it's perfect, the perfect way
to have it is where you take off all the
[SPEAKER_01]: fan leaf and trash leaf, anything that
doesn't have crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you buck it up into little buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a giant bud in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take it off of the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard because you don't want too many
cuts because like I said, every cut in
[SPEAKER_01]: there releases chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have too big of a bud,
you're not going to be able to get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you grind it up too much,
then you're going to have way too much
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people too, what I have found is if
... I've had people bring me leaf to wash,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I hate washing leaf because you have
to wash it different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot wash leaf like you wash bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a common mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people make is assuming the
instructions for what people put out there
[SPEAKER_01]: for washing fresh frozen flower is not how
you're going to want to wash your leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little different because the
material is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have washed their leaf just like
the flower and they end up with a muddled
[SPEAKER_01]: mess like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you over agitate, you get too much
leaf material in there because you break
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It mashes in there even though it's in
water and frozen, it'll still break up and
[SPEAKER_01]: if it gets too small, it just passes right
through the bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my hash was always like greenish
brown and after it was dried, it would
[SPEAKER_02]: just snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned later, I got a washing machine
like one of those Chinese made little tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: washing machines for home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized how slowly it was agitating
stuff and I was like, 45 minutes of drill
[SPEAKER_02]: speed, probably a little bit much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Annihilation, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Annihilation, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made a lot of hash but not much resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this little chunk of the
conversation because we just got to hear a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to draw out a bit more from
you, Peaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us about what your process is
like now for the business?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I definitely had to adjust
because I used to have help washing hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either Baksha and I washed together or we
had a couple of the friends from the
[SPEAKER_01]: veteran group that would come help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to adjust a lot to coming up here
and doing it by myself and then people
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting me to produce a certain amount in
a certain time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you mind taking us through the
process as though you were like in a
[SPEAKER_04]: normal work day for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was coming in to wash hash,
the first thing I have to do is I prep my
[SPEAKER_01]: washroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to put all my equipment together,
get the air conditioning running,
[SPEAKER_01]: bags ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to let your bags down so they're
not dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure everything's clean, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I line my trays with my liner so when I'm
ready to scoop they're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's see, I chill my spoons for
scooping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always put them in ice and water so
they're cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fill up my igloo reservoir with ice and
water and I put ice in my sprayer and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I take out my fresh frozen from the
freezer and then I put it into a 220 wash
[SPEAKER_01]: bag inside the Bruteless with ice and
water and then that soaks for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sits there and soaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you let it do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that I will do a 10 minute wash
and then I let it settle for 10 minutes so
[SPEAKER_01]: the hash sifts down through and collects
at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at home I used to scoop the bags with
every wash but that's really not time
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient and so now what I do is I have
ice in my catch can too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have ice in the bottom of my catch can
and then I have my bags in there and I
[SPEAKER_01]: also, because we only do full spectrum
hash which is the 70U through the 149U,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the 120 bag in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have my 104 bag and I don't have
my 90 bag in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally do, I don't catch 25 because
25 is trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will say whatever but I don't
catch 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my 45 bag, my 70 bag,
my 150 bag, the 180 bag and then a 220 bag
[SPEAKER_01]: because I always make sure I put a 220
catch bag in the top of my bags even
[SPEAKER_01]: though I wash in a 220 bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way let's say your bag rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something happens and you get material
through then you don't get it into your
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You catch it in that 220 bag first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I let it settle for 10 minutes and then
I drain it and I also keep ice in my 220
[SPEAKER_01]: bag so I'm trying to keep my catch can as
cold as possible because I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pull my bags for each wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I drain it and then I have a trash can
reservoir filled with water and I take a
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 liter glass thing and I scoop from
there and I fill up my can real quick
[SPEAKER_01]: because if I wait for the hose it takes
too long because I have a food safe
[SPEAKER_01]: drinking water hose you know and but if I
use that to fill the can it can take up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 minutes to fill the can so I fill my
reservoirs and I have them chilling and
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting there and so I scoop from there I
filled a can probably takes a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes and then I do another 10 minute
wash, 10 minute settle, drain it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I repeat the process again and at home I
used to do four to five washes but at work
[SPEAKER_01]: I do three washes and I'm done because I
found from my prior experience of washing
[SPEAKER_01]: and scooping between each wash that as
your washes go you get less and less hash
[SPEAKER_01]: and pretty much by your fist wash unless
you have like some excellent washer you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting anything but stalks you've
already gotten the heads and you'll know
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you've ever washed and kept your
washes separate and then pressed your
[SPEAKER_01]: washes separate you can tell that you get
less of a return the farther washes you go
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use a scope to scope the weed to
make sure the heads are missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just drop a bud and I break it open
and I scope it and I see like did I get
[SPEAKER_01]: most the heads are there stalks missing or
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's a great tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if you don't have a scope I would
the other thing I do is the finger sticky
[SPEAKER_01]: test and you just grab a bud and break it
open and feel it and if your fingers
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't really sticky then you probably
don't have much THC left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my main question is how are you lifting
these heavy bags?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that's pretty heavy though like 20
gallons of wet product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it's really you know the it's really
the five pounds or so weed that's wet with
[SPEAKER_01]: the ice in there about 20 pounds of ice
and however much five pounds of wet weed
[SPEAKER_01]: weighs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heavy but I don't know I just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking about when I used to
do it with like even five gallon bags but
[SPEAKER_02]: we didn't have a drain at the bottom so
we're lifting the ice in the water and
[SPEAKER_02]: that shit was heavy as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No if I had to lift the water too I
probably couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah no that would be very heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was like god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I'm standing on a stool so that I'm
waiting for my ass to fall off of there
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a ladder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well what I want is a pneumatic table one
that will go to the ground so I can wash
[SPEAKER_01]: at the ground and then pump it up and then
drain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't have that so we only have a
table so I have to stand on a little stool
[SPEAKER_01]: to wash hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I don't mind it's it's better than
sitting on a ladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably make like cheap foot pump
pneumatic tables by now though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna say like you go speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh it's just it's one of those things
where it's a it's a couple hundred dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: expense that we haven't gotten to yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure yeah yeah it could go to testing
it could go to any number of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it's gone is testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I have to say I'm proud to say I've
passed all testing and my COAs came in and
[SPEAKER_01]: my rosin tested at over 80 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've and just as a side note when we
met up you gave me some different products
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've had experience with rosin but not
a lot of experience with like really
[SPEAKER_02]: professionally well made rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I get rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not get rosin at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not understand it why it was so why
it would be a more expensive product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why people preferred it over other types.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was some exceptional stuff so
props to you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow thank you very much that that really
means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: She won the hash bash in fact for our
server.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that tells you anything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be very proud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier on you also touched on how
important drying was at home when you were
[SPEAKER_04]: learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the drying process like at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh it's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I scoop it out I put it on the
freeze dryer trays that are lined with
[SPEAKER_01]: parchment paper and then you put those in
the freezer to pre-freeze because they
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be frozen solid before you stick
them in the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I use the freeze dryer for
drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do you do adjust the temperature down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is somewhere where I'm going to come
in conflict with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using the freeze dryer for a
really long time before anybody was even
[SPEAKER_01]: using it for hash that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there might have been but the
freeze dryer works through sublimation.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens is the freeze dryer heats
up and releases the moisture from the
[SPEAKER_01]: product and the vacuum sucks it up and it
sticks to the drum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how things get dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and so the freeze dryer cycles
through a heat and cooling cycle as it
[SPEAKER_01]: does this because your products frozen in
there because it always freezes it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we first started I reached out to
somebody to ask about hey what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: drying your with your freeze dryer and all
this because I had read that hash needed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be done at a different temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they told me to run the freezer at 35
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like that's not even out of
freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like yeah you know like that's so I tried
that and I got wet hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like I had already thought
when they told me that I was like that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't sound right because it has to heat
up to a certain temperature in order for
[SPEAKER_01]: sublimation to occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how science works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your product's not defrosting at all
how is it releasing the moisture in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right amount of time or even at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally set my freeze dryer at 50
degrees because that is warm enough where
[SPEAKER_01]: it allows sublimation to occur but not so
hot that it affects the color or the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know and I just have found better
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't ever have wet hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hash is always dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because you'll see a lot of people
who tell you oh after you make your rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to tint it overnight to release
the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because you had wet hash that
you pressed because you didn't sublimate
[SPEAKER_01]: out the moisture during the freeze drying
process because everybody is so concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: about color that they're literally not
even really freeze drying their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like a thing in hash where they
want just white hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a demand or?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very frustrating because a lot of
people will pull early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know like everybody oh harvest two
weeks early and you'll have lighter color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I honestly don't like the taste of
hash rosin that's been pulled early
[SPEAKER_01]: because anybody who's a grower of any
sorts has pulled their weed early or lost
[SPEAKER_01]: a branch or something along those lines
and then dried it in the oven and smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: it right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so we've all done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that taste that weird chlorophyll like
taste that comes with that early harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that's not ripe is what you get in
your hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get that weird flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me it's an injustice to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean to me it just sounds like
marketing almost like how the customers
[SPEAKER_02]: are driving the genetics market by
demanding cookies even though growers know
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not an ideal strain to grow anymore
blah blah blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kind of all moved on past it but
because the consumers demanding it it's
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like nobody can move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the whole color thing came into
play with distillate and BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was all up oh you know you can't
have dark distillate and dark BHO means
[SPEAKER_01]: it's bad and all that and then somehow it
transferred over to hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of ridiculous because in my
opinion some of the best hash is made from
[SPEAKER_01]: sun-grown full-term weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got flavors that you just can't get
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have bigger heads?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I mean I haven't I haven't
exactly examined the difference in between
[SPEAKER_01]: the heads of indoor and outdoor up close.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a chance to do that this year
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely take a look in seeing if
there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I think it's the terpene profile
that develops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the sun does something out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how the plant was meant to grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indoor makes great hash too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think you need to let it go all the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it do what it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let those heads get white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a few amber in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it develop the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I remember when we grew the
blueberry muffin in the very beginning it
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled like pickles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it turned into this amazing jiffy
blueberry mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a few weeks time the terpene profile
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine if you're pulling two weeks
early the change in the terpenes that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens during that development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a surge of all kinds of stuff
in that last finishing part of flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are missing that because
they're so hung up on I want white rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes that yeah I mean is there ever
any white can you make white hash that is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely fully finished or would it
always include some form of amber?
[SPEAKER_01]: No it's always going to have amber because
it's just how the plant is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're seeing white hash can you
artificially do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a case where people are
artificially doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well a lot of people are passing CRC off
as hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's CRC?
[SPEAKER_01]: The color remediated stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not even hash it's actually BHO
that's been run through the color
[SPEAKER_01]: remediation thing and they remove all the
color and shit from it and then they sell
[SPEAKER_01]: it as hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Color remediation?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a thing that they make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to help remove you know because they
first used it like with distillate and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff to help remove pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides or you know stuff from the
dirty distillate and then people learned
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do it with BHO and then people
started saying oh well look at this looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like rosin so I'm gonna sell it as rosin
even though it's just treated BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's wild but you know what like
it's not too far off from what I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: in the market with them passing off
outdoors indoor in the mylar bags because
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't really see it from the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know that the market can
identify it anyways either way they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even I can have a hard time sometimes
you know like with that with your boss
[SPEAKER_02]: bitch the other day it was so well grown
and so loud and you know it the bucket
[SPEAKER_02]: said it's like 11 months old so I figured
this has to be just really well dried and
[SPEAKER_02]: cured indoor but no it's the density
everything was so nice on it I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: never guessed so yeah I mean the stuff I'm
seeing though is that's passed off as
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor to indoor is nowhere near like
that it is obviously like oxidized outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big problem with the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it is and you know like that's
another aspect of not having to deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate occupancy though that's pretty
cool if you guys can make it work you know
[SPEAKER_02]: because you won't have to play in those
games you don't as a smaller corporation
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have to appeal to investors and
people that aren't cannabis people you
[SPEAKER_02]: know pushing the rules so that's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I want to flip the question a bit and
ask you you know for those of us at home
[SPEAKER_04]: who we don't really know what to look for
in hash in terms of you talked quite a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: about the process and we just asked now
starting to talk about the end product so
[SPEAKER_04]: in your opinion you know how can we know
when hash is good in your opinion what's
[SPEAKER_04]: what makes good hash in terms of the
actual product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking visually or smoking just
to break it down for her a little further.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things so basically once hash has
arrived in your hands in some form and you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know anything about the process how
do you judge that it's good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I would say my first thing would be
just I always smell it first to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't ever judge by color because you
know I already explained that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's upon smoking it like if
it's live rosin and you know you want it
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a good melt in your bowl and not
crackle or anything like that because if
[SPEAKER_01]: it crackles or something that means it has
moisture in it and then I and then I go by
[SPEAKER_01]: the taste when I when I smoke it how it
tastes because I can't stand that early
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested taste because it to me it's just
this weird I don't even know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: describe it it's just the weird coating
flavor so I also look for like if the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes coat your mouth that's also a
good sign of a nice hash because you get
[SPEAKER_01]: that where you you know for a couple
minutes afterwards you can actually taste
[SPEAKER_01]: it on your palate and you're like yeah
you're like hmm what was that that's yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: what are these flavors that are happening
now if it's like the full melt that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to put it on a you know bowl and melt
that and see if it actually bubbles and
[SPEAKER_01]: melts down and does all that nice
gooeyness into your bowl you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna ask there's a few terms you
use like live rosin live can you explain
[SPEAKER_02]: that term because I think it's very
misunderstood even by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So live rosin means that they cut the
plant when they cut the plant down they
[SPEAKER_01]: bucked it up and immediately froze it
within like you know 20 to 30 minutes of
[SPEAKER_01]: it being cut off the plant it's put into a
bag like the way we did it was we got dry
[SPEAKER_01]: ice and we put in the ice chest and then
we put a bag in there because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want your weed to come in contact with dry
ice ever yeah because dry ice is
[SPEAKER_01]: manufactured with chemicals and so it has
chemical residues on it so dry ice can be
[SPEAKER_01]: used for stuff but you don't ever want
your stuff to come in contact with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: so you put the bag in there and then as
you're trimming the weed like we would
[SPEAKER_01]: chop the plant down hang it upside down
and then just start de-leafing and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you take the buds and you chop those up
and as you're chopping them up you're
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping them into the bag and they're
freezing and the way we do it is we put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the turkey bag first because if you you
don't want to vacuum seal them because
[SPEAKER_01]: when you vacuum seal it you smash
everything and they're gonna stick
[SPEAKER_01]: together and you're smashing trichomes and
all that so you just want it packed
[SPEAKER_01]: loosely in a bag if you want to put it in
a vacuum seal bag you can but don't vacuum
[SPEAKER_01]: seal it just seal it and then it goes
straight into a freezer and that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: it stays until it gets washed and that's
what makes it live rosin so how does that
[SPEAKER_01]: differ from fresh frozen that's the same
fresh frozen whole plant fresh frozen is
[SPEAKER_02]: what makes live rosin gotcha gotcha I've
always wondered what live meant like if
[SPEAKER_02]: they were keeping the plant in the pot and
like lifting it over to the press and like
[SPEAKER_02]: smashing it like that's what I thought I
meant I didn't know I'm like I've seen the
[SPEAKER_02]: new term like living diamonds and I'm like
living now this is taking it a step
[SPEAKER_02]: further like not just alive in a pot like
I thought but living diamonds is this have
[SPEAKER_01]: you ever heard this term that that's a new
one for me I don't know like are they
[SPEAKER_02]: still growing in there they should be
growing in my jar by the way it sounds I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know I mean I've made solventless
diamonds but I wouldn't say they were
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere close to living I mean I made
them with live rosin but I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_04]: they were living yeah going from live to
living is is it is a it is a leap a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit you know like something's inferred and
implied and the others like why you're
[SPEAKER_02]: alive I don't know I just I I remember
some of the first people I saw using the
[SPEAKER_02]: term live resin was over in Colorado I
can't remember who it was it was one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the it's one of those guys right Prichard
or one of those dudes but yeah it was it
[SPEAKER_02]: was very interesting watching that come up
and then like people gate keep over that
[SPEAKER_02]: term and saying oh no that's really not
what it is this is what it is you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like people redefining it as it went so I
was always kind of interested where the
[SPEAKER_04]: definition ended up blending in the end
yeah yeah I also did want to like just
[SPEAKER_04]: summarize some of what you said about how
you evaluate hash and you and kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: what Matt has has said about flower as
well like you can't really judge it based
[SPEAKER_04]: purely on its visuals like you were saying
too much variability too much diversity
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't really tell that something's
good based purely on how it looks I was
[SPEAKER_04]: just curious about one other quality can
you tell anything from how pliable or not
[SPEAKER_04]: the hashes is there does that mean
anything um well if it that that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: the the stuff that's a little less pliable
is what people refer to as fresh press
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what comes right off the press but
then it also depends on strains yeah every
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is different when it comes to
washing and then the texture you get at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the hash every strain has a
total different effect there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that are very creamy texture-like
and then there's ones that are almost
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter like yeah mm-hmm so it's it's hard
to judge off the texture as far as if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a good quality or not yeah I yeah I I
would agree too because like I've had with
[SPEAKER_02]: what little hash experience I have because
I I'm such a noob to hash other than like
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking like bubble hash and like finger
hash you know like going into the diamonds
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that stuff I'm fairly a noob and
so I remember making shatter back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day in San Diego and being you know like I
know what that tastes like and seeing all
[SPEAKER_02]: these other hashes come out that look like
they're just gooey trichomes I assume that
[SPEAKER_02]: shatter would be the subpar stuff now
because especially because it's so cheap
[SPEAKER_02]: now but like the other day I'm seeing
shatter that's just as tasty as anything
[SPEAKER_02]: else whereas like mentally I'm thinking
it's cheaper it must not be as good but I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't even know if that's the case do you
have any opinions on that one with shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: versus any of the other sorts you know
because the texture doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do with the quality as it well it
in some cases it does because like I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that if when we were messing around back
in the day when we would press some older
[SPEAKER_01]: weed like that was been cured and older
back when we were doing the flower rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: thing stuff from older weed came out more
shatter like like it didn't want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: creamy it didn't want to have any kind of
texture but just to make a mess like
[SPEAKER_01]: literally like glass and so I don't know
if BHO is along those same factors where
[SPEAKER_01]: you know maybe something that's older has
a tendency to not have those maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: fats and lipids that bind it together so
much so you're getting something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a totally different texture and
in that glass like texture if that makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense it's just so interesting to me
because like if you smell shatter you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like you're not getting a ton of scent off
it even some of like the dried rosin I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't get a ton of scent off it but when
you smoke it it's like full flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's there and like it's all new
experience to me you know I love it I love
[SPEAKER_02]: learning all this stuff what I don't like
is like dispensary typical dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff because you just never know what
kind of mystery magic you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when it's like black market
dispensaries and stuff that's true yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah for sure you touched on this a little
bit Peach but I did want to know what your
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite plants or strains were for
extracts the first one that comes to my
[SPEAKER_01]: head is strawberry banana she's a dream
she washes well and retains the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile very well makes a great textured
rosin just a really good one a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: other that I've washed that were good
washers were grapes and cream that one
[SPEAKER_04]: produced over five percent do you know
what the lineage of that one is no
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly I do probably an exotic Mike one
I'm guessing with and cream you know like
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies are cream type stuff yeah yeah and
he stole strawberry cream input made it
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries and cream okay that so that's
two any any others Oreos was a good washer
[SPEAKER_01]: for me let's see the dough boy didn't do
bad at all either I hate washing gelato
[SPEAKER_04]: okay yeah let's flip it what are the worst
ones it's not just me fellows no what I
[SPEAKER_01]: found with gelato is it has very thin
membranes THC membrane heads you know
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's part of what when you wash
how she want something that the the
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane of the THC head is kind of
durable so it can deal with the washing
[SPEAKER_01]: without exploring yes so gelato likes to
those heads shatter really easy and so
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens when you wash gelato is not
only are there not very many heads but the
[SPEAKER_01]: heads that there are shatter and so you
end up with like a sticky mess in your bag
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know when it's a sandy resin
it collects in a bundle and it's down
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the water and it's swirling
around but when it the head shatter like
[SPEAKER_01]: that they just want to stick in your bag
and you can't get them out like even with
[SPEAKER_01]: the coldest spray water they'll still
stick in your bag screen and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: maddening because it's a mess and you lose
THC and like it's just not fun because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's hardly anything left when you
scoop except for some fats and lipids and
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of THC the other one besides
that I have to say now I don't know whose
[SPEAKER_01]: train wreck it was but it was a train
wreck that was grown by a friend of ours
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was a horrible washer interesting
yeah we washed five pounds of it and got
[SPEAKER_01]: seven great wait five pounds and you got
seven grams absolutely horrible because
[SPEAKER_01]: when we wash five pounds of strawberry
banana we got over two ounces of rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: back oh wow yeah that's horrible so that
that's a comparison for you from over two
[SPEAKER_01]: ounces of rosin to seven grams of the same
amount of flour washed so and that would
[SPEAKER_04]: be purely because of its heads for
whatever reason yeah you know or it could
[SPEAKER_01]: be how it was grown I mean somebody else
might grow a train wreck that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: washes better I'm not sure but it has to
do a lot of factors it's you know you can
[SPEAKER_01]: go back from to the the strain itself and
the structure of its heads how it releases
[SPEAKER_01]: them how much THC it has and then you go
to the grower and that person has to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know grow it right and treat it right
because otherwise it's not gonna be very
[SPEAKER_01]: good just like flour it's the same thing
if you don't put that love and time and
[SPEAKER_01]: attention into it you're not gonna get
hash hash is only as good as what's put
[SPEAKER_04]: into it yeah it's kind of like what Matt
and I were talking about a little bit in
[SPEAKER_04]: the name game episode where the plant when
you're when you're like processing the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant they're just so many different
points at which you could mess it up
[SPEAKER_04]: really or different points at which you
could change something quite quite majorly
[SPEAKER_02]: without really knowing yeah yeah I'm
excited to see how the punchy washes did
[SPEAKER_02]: you you've gotten to smell all the the
examples now right yes I did I'm excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about that punchy one because it had some
really good flavor and I'd be interested
[SPEAKER_01]: to see if that gets to come through the
washing into the hash itself actually
[SPEAKER_02]: fingers crossed yeah yeah nice shout out
to the punchy bluster yeah oh we have the
[SPEAKER_02]: review going up tonight so you know
anybody watching this video can go back
[SPEAKER_02]: and check out the reviews of the same
samples that she's talking about right now
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah it'll be like a week in the past now
but yes yes people can check that out okay
[SPEAKER_04]: well I did want to round out some of the
tick side and I wanted to kind of bring it
[SPEAKER_04]: back to people who make hash at home and
just one want to kind of maybe ask you a
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult question which is like from all
your experience you know what would be
[SPEAKER_04]: some of your like top tips for people
making hash at home you've sort of touched
[SPEAKER_04]: on a little bit of this already so don't
don't worry about repeating yourself but
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what are the stages and what are
the techniques to focus on well if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: at home you know I have made some bomb
hash in my kitchen without a cold room you
[SPEAKER_01]: know everybody says you have a cold room
and it does help I'm not gonna lie but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at home you know wait till
nighttime and turn on your AC so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler in there the other thing would be
have a an igloo cooler you know like you
[SPEAKER_01]: put water in like construction guys use
them all the time they're drinking water
[SPEAKER_01]: safe so you get yourself an igloo cooler
cooler and you fill that up with ice and
[SPEAKER_01]: water and then you have your pump sprayer
and you fill that up with ice and when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna scoop your bags and rinse you
make sure you fill your sprayer that's
[SPEAKER_01]: full of ice with the ice water from that
igloo because the main important thing
[SPEAKER_01]: when collecting your hash and doing the
whole hash process is keeping things cold
[SPEAKER_01]: and so at home you're battling not having
a cold room and so having your spray water
[SPEAKER_01]: chilled and ready having your sprayer cold
is essential and then I have found by
[SPEAKER_01]: putting ice in the bottom of my catch can
under the bags like in the bottom where
[SPEAKER_01]: the water goes and then in my 220 bag in
the top I'll put ice in there too because
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll help keep your catch can cold yeah
and then I would say make sure you soak
[SPEAKER_01]: your or put your scoops in ice water so
they're nice and cold the using the two
[SPEAKER_01]: 220s make sure you you know you wash in
your wash bag 220 and then use a catch 220
[SPEAKER_01]: and then at home you do have to I do not
recommend doing several washes and then
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling at home you're gonna want to do
your 10-minute wash with and this would
[SPEAKER_01]: vary I mean if you've got a small set up
with a one gallon you're gonna want to
[SPEAKER_01]: wash for five minutes not ten right you
know that it sizes up as you go so you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't because you don't want to over wash
and I think sometimes a lot of people over
[SPEAKER_01]: wash more than they under wash and so at
home you're gonna want to do your wash and
[SPEAKER_01]: your settle and your drain and then you're
gonna want to collect your bags and then
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat the process after that and so as
and that's how when you collect those bags
[SPEAKER_01]: you look and see how much hash you're
getting in there and then after each wash
[SPEAKER_01]: you evaluate those scoops of hash and
that's how you can determine for yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: how many washes you want to do like I said
at home sometimes I would do four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: washes where at work I do three and I'm
done trying to get it you know through the
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles so at home I would recommend you
know as you scoop you know use your
[SPEAKER_01]: intuition if you look like you're still
getting a good amount in there then go
[SPEAKER_01]: another wash but if it's like a minuscule
amount and you're like I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's worth all that hassle then it's time
to call it quits there those are really
[SPEAKER_04]: good tips anything on the drying at home
or yeah any tips for like how we know
[SPEAKER_04]: people don't have a freeze dryer obviously
so what what's the next best thing people
[SPEAKER_01]: can do well the they want to you know use
the micron screens and just like we did
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day with the put it on the
cardboard so it pulls out the moisture and
[SPEAKER_01]: then keep it covered in the refrigerator
so it doesn't oxidize too much but it
[SPEAKER_01]: still will you know release the moisture
and do all that and then there's the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: microplaning it after that and then
letting it dry some more on the screens
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the best thing you can you can do
and if you don't care about color then you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to worry about the air too much
in most people who are drying air dry
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways aren't too worried about color
because it's already going to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: darker because of the air drying
unfortunately air is the enemy of hash so
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah yeah okay I had a one one last one on
people for people at home which is in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of the actual process of washing or
agitating you know what what is your like
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal for someone at home well I would not
use an electric mixer of any sort or a
[SPEAKER_01]: drill no drills no you can buy you know
you can either buy a whisk at the store
[SPEAKER_01]: some people like to use whisk the kitchen
store is a great place to go or like the
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurant supply store you don't mean
like a hand whisk right yeah like a
[SPEAKER_01]: machine whisk no well no they're like a
bigger whisk well it depends on the size
[SPEAKER_01]: of your buckets like if you're using a one
gallon and yeah you could use a little
[SPEAKER_01]: hand whisk no problem and I would say like
I say a five a five minute agitation on
[SPEAKER_01]: that on a little one gallon bucket now if
you're gonna go to a five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: you could probably do a ten minute and be
totally fine and I mean you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: want to beat the hell out of it but you
got to try to push the water through the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds so you're gonna want to wash it okay
I mean if you've ever watched a washing
[SPEAKER_01]: machine you know like not the new ones
that don't have the thing but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: old-school ones that spun you know that's
if you've watched any hash machine on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram run you can see how it it does
push stuff through it's not too gentle of
[SPEAKER_01]: a process but it's also you know it's it's
a learning process you can tell people and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I find is people a lot of
times somebody told me they watched for 25
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes and I'm like why 25 minutes
straight and how many times and he's like
[SPEAKER_01]: four times and I was like oh no no that's
totally unnecessary you know because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're you know you don't want to beat the
hell out of stuff yeah I can I can verify
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want to beat the hell out of
stuff because you have to remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: longer it's in the water the it if your
products frozen it's defrosting and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see is as it defrost it will start
to release chlorophyll more and so once
[SPEAKER_01]: that starts to happen is when you know you
don't want to be washing forever because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to do it in a short amount
of time before that weed gets so saturated
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a sloppy mess yeah nice yeah thank
you so many gems that you've dropped
[SPEAKER_02]: already I'm gonna have to rewatch this a
few times just yeah just to get some of
[SPEAKER_02]: this down I know a lot of it seems basic
but I am so basic when it comes to hash
[SPEAKER_04]: making I will need to yeah cuz I'm gonna
do a round soon I think so I'm gonna try
[SPEAKER_04]: and try and absorb as much of this as
possible we wanted to maybe do a little
[SPEAKER_04]: tangent away from from the hash for a
moment and ask you about your edibles yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where to begin I mean did
Matt get to try anything I did I got to
[SPEAKER_02]: try a bunch and you know I'm not a big
edible person I love the flavor of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and stuff but I've always found
it's either like my friends have put like
[SPEAKER_02]: you know ten grams into a brownie of hash
and I'll just be total for three days or I
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't get affected too much these
were really nice man and it wasn't just
[SPEAKER_02]: like the effect it was the actual flavor
the things I'd never seen before and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if you want to talk about like
some of the milk does stuff like that that
[SPEAKER_01]: are very unique and just amazing well um
you know I've been doing edibles since
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been doing weed at first I did you
know caramels cookies and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: but when we got the freeze dryer buckshot
came to me and he's like hey have you seen
[SPEAKER_01]: or ever heard of freeze-dried skittles and
I'm like of course not like I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about the freeze-dryer yet we
just got it yeah I'm reading the book here
[SPEAKER_01]: it talks about you know you do ice cream
and I'm like I remember space you know ice
[SPEAKER_01]: cream from school I remember that and
that's obviously what this is and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: like dude like we should look into
freeze-dried candies and I was like okay
[SPEAKER_01]: so we started with hash and then I threw
in some skittles and figured out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: medicate them and it was kind of over from
there yeah I bet I started doing all kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff I learned you know in my opinion
if a candy like there's certain candies
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't work Mike and Ike's don't work
chocolate doesn't freeze dry peanut butter
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't freeze dry there's certain candies
that just don't want to do things others
[SPEAKER_01]: do you know it's just a matter like
licorice just gets hard and and I only do
[SPEAKER_01]: candies that change into a texture that's
appealing like to me if it just free dries
[SPEAKER_01]: and gets hard that doesn't mean it's
actually worth it yeah exactly so it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of trial and error with things but so
yeah I started doing the freeze-dried
[SPEAKER_01]: candies because I wanted to have something
that nobody else had on the market
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody has the same edibles everybody's
got gummies they do brownies they do all
[SPEAKER_01]: the you know the same lollipops yeah yes
and so go ahead I have a I have a
[SPEAKER_04]: provocation here which is I'm someone
who's like why mix food and the you know
[SPEAKER_04]: and cannabis why not just keep them
separate make good candy sure about why
[SPEAKER_01]: why mix them like what's the point well
because consuming cannabis has a totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different effect and there are some people
who don't like to smoke and some people
[SPEAKER_01]: who can't smoke people with COPD and
things like that they can't actually you
[SPEAKER_01]: know smoke cannabis can use it and consume
it and get the benefits from it by eating
[SPEAKER_02]: it and and people eat it at work and do it
in front of everyone they'd have nobody
[SPEAKER_04]: has any clue it's nice to me yeah sorry
you go pictures and I like the edibles to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to sleep at night like when I
travel and stuff and I'm not gonna get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good a night sleep that's when I like to
use edibles because I honestly as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: I love making edibles I hate the taste of
weed with a passion like it'll almost make
[SPEAKER_02]: me puke I love it I love it so much that's
funny because there you make such good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff with it it's unreal oh you should
see my face there's times when I've made
[SPEAKER_01]: brownies right and I like out of habit
lick my finger and be so sorry oh my god
[SPEAKER_01]: so sorry that I did that because I just
can't stand the taste of it but the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: about my edibles I like is they don't have
that overwhelming weed flavor that I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get past I mean I've had edibles we bought
back in the day that I literally couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: eat I was like I can't I'm gonna puke like
I bet and so part of my goal was to create
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles that not really unique in style
but didn't have such a strong flavor that
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe people want to eat them and that was
part of the feedback I've got from people
[SPEAKER_01]: is that they do enjoy my edibles because
they're not such an overwhelming weed
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor that they can't actually enjoy it
yeah I know my my chick was doing literal
[SPEAKER_02]: dances as she ate your cucumbers your your
freeze-dried cucumbers and they had like
[SPEAKER_02]: dill on them and stuff so they're kind of
pickly yeah they were like pickle chip
[SPEAKER_02]: they were she is so in love with those
things so you even make healthy items too
[SPEAKER_01]: now that as well yes that was one of my
goals too is one I don't think you should
[SPEAKER_01]: have to eat a thousand calories to get
high yeah it's not right um cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be medicine and a lot of
people are using it for for illnesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: for cancer and we all know sugar feeds a
lot of cancer and so when I developed my
[SPEAKER_01]: edible line the one there are several
things I kept in mind one was serving size
[SPEAKER_01]: none of my bags of candy are more than a
serving of candy you don't have to eat two
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bags of skittles to get high yeah
you get 25 skittles in a bag which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: serving size of one of those little bags
of skittles that you would get and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what you get same thing with all the other
candies it's not a huge serving and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: also wanted to do healthy ones so that
somebody who can't eat candy like me yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yes can't have a fruit and I just started
doing the vegetables recently but I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing fruit for a long time because
to me that was like you can put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: yogurt you can put it in a smoothie you
can eat it straight I mean it's great and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's healthy like you you can consume it
and not feel guilty yeah and for somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's a cancer patient and they want to
consume a certain amount of cannabis a day
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important for somebody to
have a healthy choice to do that yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely and like you said ingestions
actually the strongest way to take in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in the first place so someone has
like a serious serious pain management
[SPEAKER_02]: issue like maybe like trying to sit there
and smoke joints every ten minutes it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be a bit much on their lungs so yeah
you can eat one hash brownie and be
[SPEAKER_02]: toasted for a few days and be good you
know yeah yeah I think you should be
[SPEAKER_02]: really proud of those the healthy items
that you have to because you just I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really see that in dispensaries or
collectives too often where you're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: like like cucumber chips and stuff that's
that was really really out of the box and
[SPEAKER_02]: super delicious thank you yeah I'm even
though I'm diabetic I still got to try a
[SPEAKER_02]: milk dud and those were insane I don't
even like milk duds but these things you
[SPEAKER_02]: put it it was like a ball like this big
and you put it in your mouth and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: melts it just melts it was so heaven it
was so good so yeah I'm a fan I'm a fan
[SPEAKER_01]: for life thank you that's part of the
other cool thing about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze-dried things is stuff that like
people who have teeth problems you know
[SPEAKER_01]: some people can't eat saltwater taffy
anymore any kind of taffy and when you
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze just you know like the caramel
inside the milk that is it puffs up and it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes that crunchy ball of goodness and
so like saltwater taffy does the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing it puffs into a little ball and so
it just melts in your mouth and so people
[SPEAKER_01]: who can't eat those things anymore can now
eat them and experience that same flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: just in a different way and experience
without losing a tooth or messing up their
[SPEAKER_02]: dental work or any of that stuff yeah
that's for real I got jacked up teeth
[SPEAKER_02]: since I was young so like that's a serious
concern like hard candies and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that I don't even mess with it because I
don't want to knock out teeth or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy but yeah these just melt in your
mouth it was insane insane so good I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: jealous you should be you really should be
zero maybe one day I'll make it over maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: one day yeah you've got to you've got the
next party yes you definitely must well I
[SPEAKER_04]: did actually have more questions within
the like extracts or hash section but I
[SPEAKER_04]: also thought we could move to some more
general open questions about you know your
[SPEAKER_04]: reflections on your time in the industry
and whatnot and then maybe if we have time
[SPEAKER_04]: after that we can come back to some of the
other extract questions yeah so I did want
[SPEAKER_04]: to come back to the you know how has it
been you know you mentioned women in the
[SPEAKER_04]: context of like veterans and like them
needing safe spaces what's it like for you
[SPEAKER_04]: as a woman in the in the in the cannabis
scene feel free to be as honest as you
[SPEAKER_04]: want you know or not yeah yeah as
diplomatic or is not as well it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a man a male-dominated industry
yeah that's for damn sure and for me I
[SPEAKER_01]: think my version of being a woman in the
industry is probably a little different
[SPEAKER_01]: than some others because I don't have any
big names behind me I don't I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: related to anybody famous yeah I've had to
fight tooth and nail to be where I am I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember going to get a job trying to get
a job at the local grow store and they
[SPEAKER_01]: told me they wouldn't hire me because I
was a girl and I guarantee I could grow
[SPEAKER_01]: better weed than anybody there from as you
could and for example when I first started
[SPEAKER_01]: this job there was another guy that he had
actually wanted to do an article on me for
[SPEAKER_01]: some about flower rosin that he had gotten
from me and anyway he he got to talking
[SPEAKER_01]: with the people who I'm involved with pure
organic medicinals and he actually during
[SPEAKER_01]: a period of time I had because I'm a
two-time cancer survivor I've had breast
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer and ovarian cancer so a couple
years ago I had a scare where I thought my
[SPEAKER_01]: breast cancer had come back and so I was
unable to come up to work for like two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks because I had to go to my
appointments and have a mammogram and
[SPEAKER_01]: ultrasound and all this stuff and during
that time period this guy tried to take my
[SPEAKER_01]: job Wow and I guarantee if I had been a
male he wanted to try to do that no yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: and because he was trying to set his
girlfriend up to be the female presser for
[SPEAKER_01]: our company and you know and I'm like I am
a female yeah I don't I don't need help
[SPEAKER_01]: like so it's been hard you know I went and
took they paid for me to take a class a
[SPEAKER_01]: hash class this the pure organics paid for
me to go take this hash class just to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what was going on out there and I found it
funny because we went to the class and
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first showed up they're like oh are
you here to drop somebody off um no I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: here to take the class oh okay and then I
I was nice I brought you know because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: a giving person so I brought some edibles
with me and I handed them out and I find
[SPEAKER_01]: it funny that after I paid for a class and
took the class and I watched that for
[SPEAKER_01]: those people in that class follow
everybody who took the class but not one
[SPEAKER_04]: of them followed me that's why that is so
to me they are so sad and oh man yeah it's
[SPEAKER_04]: sad but also like unsurprising
unfortunately to me it's also their loss
[SPEAKER_02]: like even in our group you know like our
group it is a very good demographic of
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly male like the cannabis community is
it's like a few females and 99% male but
[SPEAKER_02]: like not at any time what I have ever
thought to not like respect your
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and skills because you're a
woman like it wouldn't have mattered if
[SPEAKER_02]: your name was sweet peach kiss or Dougie
Bob fresh you know it wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: mattered and I just it blows my mind that
people are so ignorant they'll walk away
[SPEAKER_02]: from some someone super talented that they
can learn a lot from just to uh not have
[SPEAKER_02]: to cater to women or some annoying shit I
don't get it myself but it's yeah it is
[SPEAKER_04]: that I just want to say you know shout out
and respect to all the women in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry it can't be easy um right for all
those reasons and and yeah I think you
[SPEAKER_04]: know we're gonna we do what we can I think
within our little community to to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that you know people feel as as safe
and as comfortable and as welcome as we
[SPEAKER_04]: can make them um but yeah it's definitely
a set of problems that like this industry
[SPEAKER_04]: has not dealt with yet not very well not
at all not at all yeah not to mention I
[SPEAKER_01]: could tell you a couple of hash makers who
I've had to block because they you know
[SPEAKER_01]: for some reason find it necessary to find
send pictures of not hash oh yeah and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's another thing in our like I hear
this all the time guys keep your dick in
[SPEAKER_02]: your pants women don't want to see that
it's ugly like no I've never heard heard
[SPEAKER_02]: of a woman in my life like man I'd really
like to see someone's penis that's a very
[SPEAKER_02]: attractive fleshy member like what do they
think like this is not I don't know I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: much rather see a picture of hash yeah
right yeah show me your hash something
[SPEAKER_02]: will impress me not your little dick right
yeah yeah because now I gotta block you
[SPEAKER_01]: and fucking all that because it's totally
inappropriate and unnecessary and like
[SPEAKER_02]: really and it creates a lot of bad
feelings too because it's not just you
[SPEAKER_02]: it's your man too because now you know
what I mean well yeah and no thought at
[SPEAKER_01]: all in it no would you do that to any
other male hash maker I'm sorry do you do
[SPEAKER_01]: you send your dick to him to a guy not my
maybe it makes you what we need to start
[SPEAKER_04]: doing we need to we need to equalizing
things so yes we do I'm gonna start
[SPEAKER_02]: sending my dick to every breeder out there
in hash maker you're welcome I'll just
[SPEAKER_04]: start sending someone else's dick to every
other guy well yeah I'm not really gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: send mine I don't want to get made fun of
yeah anyway yeah yeah so you know again
[SPEAKER_04]: like mad respect it's it must be one of
those things where like there's such the
[SPEAKER_04]: obvious obstacles that you face must be so
subtle sometimes and so sinister and no
[SPEAKER_04]: one else can see them you know a lot of
the men won't be able to see what you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: are facing him yeah hopefully over time we
hear more stories like yours and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: like with anything else we just draw
people's attention to the fact that these
[SPEAKER_02]: things happen yeah still yeah you know I
just to add to this I watched you know I I
[SPEAKER_02]: had had mentioned that we were gonna be
putting this Jill seeds on the site and
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was pretty disgusted at the response
that that the male people were giving her
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of it had nothing to do with her as
like being a person it was more about her
[SPEAKER_02]: being female and I just judging her off
just being female and it was just so bad
[SPEAKER_02]: in I ended up blocking so many people that
day it's just yeah do better please do
[SPEAKER_01]: better kind of security you know that's
part of why I don't post pictures like of
[SPEAKER_01]: myself smoking and doing all that because
I want to be taken seriously I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be seen as an influencer or a dab hoe
I've had to work really hard to not be
[SPEAKER_01]: considered as a dab hoe you know you have
to work extra hard you have to work extra
[SPEAKER_02]: hard and that's that's not fair yeah yeah
it's actually so terrible like yeah what
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to wear like fake glasses to look
smarter and I don't know like shorter man
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually so ridiculous no I actually
you know I posted a picture of myself
[SPEAKER_01]: washing hash and I'm sorry I have boobs
I'm a female and sometimes in the cold
[SPEAKER_01]: room even in the middle of summer it's
cold but when you're washing hash you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get warm like I do I don't know maybe it's
just a hot flash or whatever anyway so I
[SPEAKER_01]: posted a video on me washing hash because
I'm proud of the fact that I can do this
[SPEAKER_01]: by myself like yeah I don't have a team I
don't have any help up here it's literally
[SPEAKER_01]: me by myself and I do it the whole way
through and I take great pride in that and
[SPEAKER_01]: some guy posted commented on my post oh
well you know just using your boobs to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell hash blah blah blah and I was like
how is it that a guy can post himself
[SPEAKER_01]: washing hash and nobody says shit about
him but because I have boobs you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: make shitty comments to me that I'm trying
to use my boobs to sell hash really
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just threatened I mean it's just
yeah to me that's just like threatened
[SPEAKER_01]: easy yeah exactly I find out real quick
the man who have egos yeah about it by the
[SPEAKER_01]: way people respond to me and talk to me
you know the discourse being great people
[SPEAKER_01]: are amazing that's because it's a way
better community there than I've found
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere else so that makes me happy props
to you for creating that because you know
[SPEAKER_01]: if the guys in there are funny as hell
though I have to say yeah you know like I
[SPEAKER_02]: have to remind myself like to be extra but
like you don't ever get offended by my
[SPEAKER_01]: dumb ass dick jokes or anything else I'm
used to like growing you know being in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry this whole time pretty
much it's all been guys I've always been
[SPEAKER_01]: what I call windy of the Peter Pan boys
yeah yeah I'm usually the only girl of the
[SPEAKER_01]: group and it's all a bunch of crazy wild
guys doing whatever and I'm over here like
[SPEAKER_01]: can we not do that so we don't die yeah
I'm like the voice of reason of everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's kind of how discord feels yeah I
mean that's that's the other funny part
[SPEAKER_04]: like I think people see you know identify
someone as a woman in there like please
[SPEAKER_04]: mother me I'm gonna do some naughty stuff
can you tell me not to do it yeah at the
[SPEAKER_04]: same time I will say like we do have a few
demented people in our in our community
[SPEAKER_04]: but overall I think it's like a pretty
good place sometimes they hide in plain
[SPEAKER_04]: sight but you know we we're always keeping
an eye on it we're always looking at ways
[SPEAKER_04]: to improve it so very much appreciate your
presence there yeah me too yeah okay well
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys have both been an awesome awesome
yeah bucks great yeah yeah yeah yeah power
[SPEAKER_04]: couple I think is what people in the
server believe that's a term I did want to
[SPEAKER_04]: move on to you kind of reflecting more on
GI Mary Jane's as well as kind of adjacent
[SPEAKER_04]: so you mentioned that it kind of slowed
down over COVID is it starting back up is
[SPEAKER_01]: it still active we're currently not active
because I'm trying to find a place to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really afford to rent somewhere
for us all to meet and I live up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hills and I will plus I don't let
strangers come to my house I mean I know
[SPEAKER_01]: these ladies but like if we have a group
of somebody who wants to come that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know I can't trust people at my house yeah
so we're I'm I'm still currently looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for a meeting place because it needs to be
somewhere where we can hang out and smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah not many people allow that yeah
inside I was just thinking sorry this is
[SPEAKER_04]: totally an interruption but I was just
thinking I don't know how the women are
[SPEAKER_04]: with tech but you know you could always
set up like a little discord just for them
[SPEAKER_04]: as well in the absence of like a you know
a physical space you could have a little
[SPEAKER_04]: idea yeah yeah if you need help let us
know but pretty easy honestly that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: great idea well because you know y'all
could even do like little virtual sessions
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff yeah cuz I don't know I I always
think about part of it is the camaraderie
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have to be able to talk and hang
out and that's it you just totally yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: well I think Matt knows this but I always
have like an eye towards like what it
[SPEAKER_04]: takes to build community and sustain it so
yeah I'm always interested in that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing yeah I love I love that idea too I
just got to say that again like the
[SPEAKER_02]: forethought into it the that there are
women getting together to speak about this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff it's amazing I love it yeah so cool
yeah you know the being you know I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: a victim in my life I was raped when I was
18 and I also when I was in sixth grade I
[SPEAKER_01]: was boy tried to take me into the bushes
on the way home from school and then when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I used to manage the pines bar and I
was doing it was a really great job it was
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect I was able to support us I was a
bartender and one night I had asked some
[SPEAKER_01]: guys to leave the bar because they were
being too rowdy and I did exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: Buckshot asked me not to ever do which was
come out from behind the bar yeah and
[SPEAKER_01]: escort people out because security was
busy out on the patio and so as I was
[SPEAKER_01]: walking out the door telling these people
to leave a gentleman came running up from
[SPEAKER_01]: behind me and took a giant flying leap and
used the back of my head as a punching bag
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell I lost consciousness of
course ground I had to go to the emergency
[SPEAKER_01]: room it took me a year of physical therapy
to recover and I actually ended up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: permanent disability where I lost 30% of
the use of my right arm yeah and I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: able to bartend anymore you can't bartend
without your right hand did they catch him
[SPEAKER_01]: no no my brother-in-law had him for five
minutes on the table beaten the shit out
[SPEAKER_01]: of him until security came and grabbed him
off of him and let the guy run out the
[SPEAKER_02]: door like oh my god well at least he got
some he did he got he got some he did get
[SPEAKER_01]: some but he didn't get what he deserved
because he messed up my entire life you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: never hit me like I don't care who you are
if it's a man woman you never hit someone
[SPEAKER_02]: in the back of the head because the
consequences of this part of your your
[SPEAKER_02]: spine like it's so permanent and even if
you're mad at someone the damage you can
[SPEAKER_02]: do not only to them but to your life as
far as prison goes is immense so please
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody listening never ever think to do
that never it's horrible less to a woman I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't imagine yeah if I had seen it come
and at least could have fought back but I
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no clue and it was so quick I just
remember this blinding pain in my head
[SPEAKER_01]: that just came forward and then like I was
on the ground and then his girlfriend's
[SPEAKER_01]: like can I buy you a shot of tequila bro
no that's okay but that's part of why I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: also proud of being able to wash hash like
I do is that you know I'm I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: disabled I my right arm and shoulders been
fucked up ever since then yeah and he
[SPEAKER_01]: totally yanked out the rug from under my
feet I mean I had a job that supported us
[SPEAKER_01]: I made really really really good money
like I was the manager and head bartender
[SPEAKER_01]: like and we had I don't know if you
thousandfold had ever heard of contiki
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I know what that is yeah you know I
could we had contiki night on Thursdays
[SPEAKER_01]: every Thursday night I did that whole tour
bus and everybody was from Australia and
[SPEAKER_01]: New Zealand and oh man those were the best
nights
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah contiki tours are a really popular
thing for like the younger people who've
[SPEAKER_04]: like you know they go on what they call
the OE overseas experience because the
[SPEAKER_04]: country so isolated you know they need to
go somewhere that's really cool that
[SPEAKER_04]: you've you've come across some of those
people yeah that's funny yeah it was great
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know we're right by the
gateway to Yosemite so we're part of that
[SPEAKER_02]: whole of course see everything yeah so it
was great how far do you have to travel to
[SPEAKER_01]: work hmm up here I drive six hours what
yeah Wow I had no idea you stay there
[SPEAKER_04]: right you don't you don't go back home you
stay there for a few days oh no I stay in
[SPEAKER_02]: a hotel yeah Wow I had no idea you drove
that far up north yeah that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: that's again commendable that's hard
working going way out of your way to get
[SPEAKER_01]: this done so props on that yeah thank you
like I said it's been not been easy it's
[SPEAKER_04]: been a hard road to try to do this yeah
yeah I mean speaking of hard road you know
[SPEAKER_04]: thank you again so much for sharing you
know some of those stories you know really
[SPEAKER_04]: really really hard stuff and I hope
everyone who's listening like you know
[SPEAKER_04]: take something away from that yeah well
you know we are coming I think close to
[SPEAKER_04]: the end and I wanted to ask you know
what's next for you what's next for like
[SPEAKER_01]: the business and yeah what are you excited
about I'm excited about hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution and things actually hitting
the market that's coming is that near it
[SPEAKER_01]: is that's what I've been doing this last
few days is getting everything brammed up
[SPEAKER_01]: and packaged it just takes a while because
it's only me I'm the only one that does
[SPEAKER_01]: all the gramming because I'm the only one
with the quality control yeah so it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: a while and plus I can't be up here you
know I have my other businesses I run and
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's it's hard I come up here and I do
some work but then I got to go home and do
[SPEAKER_01]: work and so I can't be up here plus I
can't afford a hotel for more than a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple days at a time I bet because you're
investing your own money in this to do
[SPEAKER_02]: this correct like the gas hotel well yeah
between a lot of the time hotel and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that yeah sometimes they pay me like when
they have money and then sure like I said
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes they don't so it's you know it's
a labor of love for you and hoping it yes
[SPEAKER_01]: it is yeah so getting to hit distribution
means I will be getting a paycheck
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually like that's what I'm hoping for
so this becomes my full-time job so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: fully immerse in it and then if it all
takes off then they're supposed to put in
[SPEAKER_01]: a kitchen so that then my edibles can hit
the market and that's probably another
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that I'm most excited about is money
money when people taste your edibles
[SPEAKER_02]: that's money I'm telling you I've tried so
many edibles it's money you have to live
[SPEAKER_04]: me and Matt know when things are starting
up so we can like you know spread the word
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah I will definitely absolutely yeah I'm
on that note you know anything else from
[SPEAKER_02]: either of you any other reflections
questions no I I'm good peach is there
[SPEAKER_02]: anything you want to plug any anything you
wanted to say specifically get any
[SPEAKER_01]: messages out well you guys helped me plug
pure organic medicinals I mean that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: company that I'm representing and working
for and so when you guys see it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shows just know that I made that hash by
hand right been hand-washed so I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's it you know I mean thank you so
much I mean you that I can it's been such
[SPEAKER_04]: a good conversation you know what a great
mix of like you know your personal journey
[SPEAKER_04]: the tech the industry you know some of
your experiences as a woman like this has
[SPEAKER_04]: been such a cool episode so thank you so
much thank you thank you I hope I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: ramble too much not at all no it was great
I learned a lot I learned a lot and like I
[SPEAKER_02]: said I'm gonna have to go back and read
this several times as I'm sure a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people will because there's a lot of good
info here as for especially for the
[SPEAKER_02]: aspiring like hash makers like this is
this is great I'm thinking about starting
[SPEAKER_01]: my own discord for hash so you should
people want to ask me questions I'll ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I answer questions I'm not one of
people that's not gonna tell you things so
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah we could also we could also set up
like an extracts channel I know we sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: have the hash bash maybe we could convert
that into like an extracts channel as well
[SPEAKER_04]: sure whatever yeah of course you know like
do go try setting up these other
[SPEAKER_04]: communities especially like you know I was
floating the idea GI Mary James I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that could be a really cool idea yeah just
let us know if you need any help as well
