[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_01]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_01]: Natsodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with local botanist, our very
good friend from the Breeders' Syndicate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have Thousandfold here to help me
host this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand, do you want to tell them what
we're going to be talking about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last week we covered the technical
aspects of the seed making process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we promised, this episode is the
first episode in a series on breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some disclaimers to start us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is a huge and extremely complex
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not authorities and cannot promise
perfect information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'll do my best and I'm
sure the other two will do their best as
[SPEAKER_00]: well to signpost clearly when we're
uncertain or when we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode will be an overview on
some of the science and theory behind
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where it does and does not meet up
with the practical reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because breeding is such a big and
complex topic, we're going to try to draw
[SPEAKER_00]: a loose perimeter around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perimeter, I should say, around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A line in the sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a foundation to work from for
the subsequent episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the subsequent episodes, we,
I think, will want to cover different
[SPEAKER_00]: historical or hypothetical breeding
scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will allow us to get more into
the particularities and nuances of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in terms of how today's show is
going to be laid out, we're going to first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all cover the or gesture towards the
Mendelian science behind breeding and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of its limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're then going to move on to an overview
of breeding techniques and strategies and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of give an isolated account of each
with a little bit of context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we'll summarize with a
section called what makes breeding so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, without further ado,
I wanted to dive into some of the science
[SPEAKER_00]: behind breeding, specifically the science
drawn from Mendel's principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Mendelian framework of breeding,
because this is many, I think many of us
[SPEAKER_00]: have this as a reference point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of us have maybe picked this up at
high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, it's pretty easy to pick up
now if you haven't come across this
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to actually teach people
what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I will say is that Mendel's
principles of inheritance provide like a
[SPEAKER_00]: basic understanding of how traits are
passed from parents to offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of laid the basis for modern
breeding in the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: So paired pretty closely with that is the
Punnett Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you will be familiar with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a little table that helps
you predict potential outcomes of crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: between two individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a visual representation of the
possible combination of alleles and helps
[SPEAKER_00]: you determine like the genotypic and
phenotypic ratios for the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, trying to draw a line around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the tool is meant to help you
predict, design and control your breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I wanted to start with this is
because I think there's actually quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: big disconnect between that idealized
simplified theory of breeding and the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual reality of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, before I kind of dive into
some of the reasons why that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, Matt, did you or Loco,
did you want to say anything about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your vibe with the Mendelian
stuff in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not off of the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with Mendel's stuff in general,
that's like you said, it's usually the
[SPEAKER_01]: first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people encounter any kind of
genetic learning, whether it's in high
[SPEAKER_01]: school or, you know, college, intro level
botany class or even biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an intro based on one-to-one pairing
of alleles.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times that means very simple
traits in an IVL.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go more into that too, so people
understand what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, it's the idea behind it is
a very uniform, predictable line crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: to another uniform, predictable line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what will come from those pairings
when there are very simple traits be it
[SPEAKER_01]: parents with blue eyes, parents with brown
eyes, very simple one-to-one trait
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a perfect place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so like Matt said, the simple
Mendelian framework, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: assumes that, well, not first of all,
but generally, assumes that traits are
[SPEAKER_00]: like easily identifiable, easily
measurable, and that each trait is
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled by a single gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like a one-to-one
correspondence between the trait and gene
[SPEAKER_00]: for this model to kind of like be at its
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have our first question
here as well, which I think is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the win asks, I really want to know
what is meant by true breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand past traits, but what is the
test to make sure that it's true?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll say this, that in terms of
science, a true breeding trait or plant
[SPEAKER_00]: means that it is homozygous for that
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're talking about a pure line in
general, you're saying that those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are homozygous for most traits.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loco, does that sound right to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I kind of am curious,
from a practical point of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you don't have the science,
how can you tell whether something,
[SPEAKER_00]: a trait or a plant is true breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Only by observing the progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the simple, basic way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should you want me to give examples on
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like example, lube on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a worked blueberry line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that just from practical data from
other people having grown it, that it
[SPEAKER_01]: typically in most rooms would express
heavily blueberry terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, we didn't know that it
would necessarily breed true for those
[SPEAKER_01]: traits, meaning anything it's crossed to
or whatever it's crossed to, we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it would pass those very traits
consistently, you know, and that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were trying to see if it was true
breeding for a single trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those crosses, when we did them,
most of the time, no matter what it was
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed to, the very traits were dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, it's not totally true breeding,
but it's more true breeding than most
[SPEAKER_01]: plant you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll also add on that you kind of have to
look for something to breed truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: For one trait, like you can't assume that
one plant is going to breed true for like
[SPEAKER_03]: six different traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in this, you have to kind of
target a single trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big thing to notice too in
cannabis or to note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that takes me to our next
point as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the other reasons why
it's so difficult to apply Mendel's model
[SPEAKER_00]: like Matt already said is that we have a
distinct lack of fixed or true breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and true homozygosity in cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another little narrative that
comes out of Mendel's framework,
[SPEAKER_00]: which people love to refer to,
which is the idea that you have two,
[SPEAKER_00]: you begin with two true breeding parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross them to produce a true F1 hybrid
with heterosis and hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to spend this narrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you also have to say that there,
if you're going to make a true F1 hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has to be two distinctly distinct and
different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, that's one of the other most
important parts for a true F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be two distinctly different
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people also like to talk about
the fact that yeah, in a true F1 hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: population, it's meant to be homogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have two properly homozygous
parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't happen in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And second, secondly, the stage that's
meant to follow that is the F2 stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to Mendel's model,
when you begin with two true breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct parents, it's in the F2
generation where you're meant to see
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypic segregation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in our world, you couldn't see
segregation probably at every generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this model doesn't work on that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is interesting to me when I think
about what you make of a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that you bought that says F1, F2,
because people make assumptions based on
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendel's framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sure do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What those things actually mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to that narrative of the
true F1 hybrid going to F2 with
[SPEAKER_00]: segregation, some of the other reasons why
we can't easily apply Mendel's framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, there's something called polygenic
traits, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: these are single traits that could be
controlled by multiple genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you look at Mendel's
framework, they're meant to be one-to-one
[SPEAKER_00]: correspondence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that already adds a significant amount
of complexity to your search or your
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is genetic linkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have genes that are kind of
grouped, linked within the same chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: that further complicates your efforts to
kind of isolate correspondences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have something else called,
I don't know if I'm saying this term
[SPEAKER_00]: right, pleiotropy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleiotropy, you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, where it's one gene that actually
affects multiple traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the inverse of polygenic,
where polygenic is one trait controlled by
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one gene affecting multiple
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a really important one when
it comes to cannabis called suppressor
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another version of the link
trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And suppressor traits, instead of like a
link trait being like if this trait is
[SPEAKER_01]: here in this plant and this trait is here
in this plant, all of a sudden you see the
link trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this trait that you hadn't seen
before because it needs both factors to
[SPEAKER_01]: show it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the suppressor trait, it's the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs both traits to suppress it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden this trait is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas both parents may have something
that you think is awesome, but for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason, certain alleles or genes
line up differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they're crossed,
that suppressor trait completely
[SPEAKER_01]: suppresses a specific trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a super important cannabis,
Neville used to refer to it as the ghost
[SPEAKER_01]: trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Michael.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also add, I was reading earlier that there
are obviously what we call dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: traits, but there are like additive
traits, kind of the opposite of your
[SPEAKER_03]: suppressor trait that you were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess here's an example since I can't
really speak at a strain level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say we have fish in the wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this gene, one that allows for it
to have, it blends in so it's not heavily
[SPEAKER_03]: predated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are these additive genes
that are gonna have to do with size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that fish can, if it has that
genetic trait, the dominant gene will
[SPEAKER_03]: breed true for that lesser amount of
predation gene, but have variability in
[SPEAKER_03]: size due to those additive type genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still gonna breed true for that
anti-predation gene, but you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_03]: these other influences that are not really
gonna affect that dominant gene's effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if that really- No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for me, preparing for this episode
has been really different from the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones because the other ones I could kind
of loosely sketch the structure off the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of my head, whereas this one,
because I am an amateur, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had to do a bit of personal
investigation, some actual research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the points I just made are
new things that I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing to me just how complex
and wild the reality of sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction and all the complexities of
the genetics are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think- I've used this example
several times, and we probably won't get
[SPEAKER_01]: into epigenetics because it's so little
known about it, especially in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a big one too, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the example that was kind of like a
paradigm shift for me was learning that a
[SPEAKER_01]: male that smokes one single cigarette,
right, he smokes one single cigarette,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll affect his progeny down four
generations through epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like in papers now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really blew my mind because if you
think about the stressors that we put our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis through and the epigenetics and
all that, you can imagine how far down we
[SPEAKER_01]: are affecting progeny without even
realizing what we're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I- Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and environmental factors- It's
important for breeders to be competent
[SPEAKER_01]: growers for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, environmental factors in general
can't be covered by this model of
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's precisely one of the major things
that's being excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess those are kind of the general
points that I wanted to gesture towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was mostly to name some of the many
reasons why you cannot just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, take that framework and now just slap
it on because this science is a
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified, idealized model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, very idealized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a one size fit all at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I kind of want to conclude this
section just by saying like, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that we have to throw all the science
out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are obviously still really,
really important principles that Mendel's
[SPEAKER_00]: outlined that absolutely relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still many kind of techniques
and strategies for breeding that come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of these principles that are still
fundamental to modern breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the last thing I just wanted to also
throw a mention at, which we won't go into
[SPEAKER_00]: is of course, there's much more modern
science now beyond Mendel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have marker assisted breeding and stuff
like that, but that's going to be outside
[SPEAKER_00]: the scope of our talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I don't do any marker assisted
breeding, I could not talk confidently on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have people doing that in cannabis
yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know he's done some great marker
assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely beyond us for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did now want to segue into an
overview of various breeding techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: and strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to begin this section,
the two really, really important questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think both of you could help expand
on is, number one, what material are you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually starting with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, what are your breeding
goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Matt, you had quite a bit,
I think you and Loco and myself had a
[SPEAKER_00]: little discussion yesterday about this and
what do you think it takes to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you are starting with?
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been the drum I've been beating
and probably, I get a lot of comments
[SPEAKER_01]: about me being the strain police or
genetic police or the fun police when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you take that so serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is, for breeders,
if you don't know what you're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't have a firm grip on the
history, for example, you go buy your
[SPEAKER_01]: first pack of seeds, or not even your
first pack, you just go buy a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from someone you don't really know
that much about, but you've seen their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff advertised in high time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take it home, you go make crosses
with it, and you find out five years later
[SPEAKER_01]: that this was actually bought from Spain
and was a bulk purchase and it's just some
[SPEAKER_01]: random, maybe OG Cushcross made in Spain
that was relabeled as something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, you've been selling
seeds or passing out seeds with God knows
[SPEAKER_01]: what genetics listed as something and now
your name's tied to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all this data you've been bringing in
like, okay, in my head, this is what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing this expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be from this parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing this expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be from this parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start adding this data into your
data bank in your brain and you start
[SPEAKER_01]: growing more strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're making more conclusions
based off that first grow on what you grew
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're assuming that it was
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many things happen from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you properly sort through and get
good starting material to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is such a complex process and it's
really a personal journey and it took me
[SPEAKER_01]: over a decade to really feel confident
about who I was buying seeds from or who I
[SPEAKER_01]: was getting seeds from in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really boiled down to knowing your
breeder, asking your breeder questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: being very competent, learning myself
about breeding and asking them hard
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about not even necessarily hard,
but earnest questions about the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: making the seeds, where they source the
cut, sometimes talk to the person they
[SPEAKER_01]: source the cut from.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really, really want to do
breeding breeding, starting material and
[SPEAKER_01]: being confident in your starting material
is as important as anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard to illustrate that
until someone's further in the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: career and they have to go back and see
how accurate their shit was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost no one can nail it in the first
few rounds because of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation and cannabis and the smoke
and mirrors and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an overlooked mega important part
of the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't tell you how many times people
message like me or one of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders and it'll be like, yeah,
dude, I got my, you know, like XYZ,
[SPEAKER_01]: some brand new guy that we know has never
sourced anything correctly crossed to DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, whatever, you know, like,
and they want us to be jazzed about it
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, at the same time, I know where
those guys source their stuff and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no way what he thinks he has he
has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an impression he's now left on
me that this person really didn't do their
[SPEAKER_01]: research from the beginning and they're
already making and selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How your relationships form in this
industry to learn from people and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: mentored can be affected by your choice
and research ability and what you start
[SPEAKER_01]: with and where you end up in the
conclusions you draw from said data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most importantly, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is is why it's so important to do that
research initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I mean, if you don't have a
good starting point, it's going to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: all your downstream actions and results.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's several years of projects
that I've done that I look back on even
[SPEAKER_01]: even like seven, eight, nine years into my
career that I look back on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's embarrassing because some of them
were obviously so off from what I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: they would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as their part in history or what
what was actually in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go and use them because I think
they're game and I trust the breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't always turn out correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there I can think of several examples
where I look goofy as shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like like looking back, I judge myself as
being very goofy for not having done the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper research and taking someone's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you want to add to that local?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I mean, obviously, provenance is,
you know, very, very important because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we we do have to, you know,
take into consideration ethics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like science, you know,
obviously, like one of the.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess key points of it is to make sure
you have ethical data, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's not, you know, is it really valid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on top of that, I'll also add,
you know, this isn't something that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can just like dive right into and start
reading from the get go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to learn your parent material
like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's not like you can just make a
cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can, but is that actually
reading?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does take many cycles to learn a parent
because it's not simply growing a dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, while that is one aspect of it,
you kind of want to see how it expresses
[SPEAKER_03]: in multiple different kinds of grows,
because then you can kind of gauge what
[SPEAKER_03]: those progenies may express.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if it's leaning towards that
parent, if that makes sense, you can make
[SPEAKER_01]: a much better educated guess that way for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an educated guess is, you know,
educated guesses in in breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in your first the first pairing,
educated guesses are a lot of where we all
[SPEAKER_01]: start, because before seeing the progeny,
that's what you have is educated theories
[SPEAKER_01]: or guesswork based on observations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will add to that, I know we did breeding
goals and and something else as an episode
[SPEAKER_01]: before, but I really felt like it kind of
got confused between what I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about with breeding and what breeding is
and and with I think it was not so on that
[SPEAKER_01]: one saying that, you know, like breeding
is just crossing two things and seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really firmly believe that breeding is
goal oriented and only goal oriented and
[SPEAKER_01]: that making things to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's a part of learning,
but that is not a part necessarily of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, the actual breeding process
proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to clarify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, we could go much deeper
into the actual breeding as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: just repeating the crossing, see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the only other point I wanted
to add, or it's maybe a paraphrase of what
[SPEAKER_00]: both of you have said, but because there's
a distinct lack of good information on
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance and history, often you do have
to treat your starting material like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a black box to begin with.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether it is like Loco said,
whether you're starting with parent
[SPEAKER_00]: material and you're needing to grow them
out in various ways, in various
[SPEAKER_00]: environments to kind of really see what
they do, because or you're actually having
[SPEAKER_00]: to run out progeny to see the kinds of
ratios you might get in the phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if you can like almost backwards
deduce more information about the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really hard to do without the
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk in other episodes about like
thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about a lot about learning the
baselines, be it Northern Lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk One, Hayes, different Africans like
Swazi, Durbin, things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: the baselines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say that is for the
people who want to backwards deduce like
[SPEAKER_01]: what possible parentage may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learning those baselines is one of the
most important things in being able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing Neville taught me
early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as Hogg.
[SPEAKER_01]: James Hogg taught me the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learn the baselines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be serious about breeding,
know those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to add that in too,
because there is no reason like when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're starting breeding, there's no
reason not to learn those because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: so important and they are the makeup of
like 90 percent of what we have out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what we've really been
addressing in this section so far is the
[SPEAKER_00]: infamous information space and the kind of
tactics that you need to employ to get as
[SPEAKER_00]: much information as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will also add that like if people
are having trouble doing the research,
[SPEAKER_01]: we do have our Patreon Discord for Breeder
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like what we do 24-7 is talk
about genetics, history, research,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do this research, how to apply the
research, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are much better resources than
there were at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of just saying like, go do your
research, we're actually trying to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: a platform for people to do their
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Thousand, because we have our
codex we're working on with the strain
[SPEAKER_01]: base as well, because we want to provide a
very accurate strain base that is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: wiki where everybody can add to it and add
whatever goofiness they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Thousand has put a lot of hours into
doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really stoked for everybody to
check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super hyped about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, coming back to where we are,
we just talked a bit about how you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what material you're starting with and
some allusion to breeding goals based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the knowledge that you have of what you're
starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to divide the rest of this
section into two broad categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes your starting point is
already a couple of individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps, whose traits you're trying to
narrow down and lock in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times, you might be starting with a
pool of material in which you are wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to perform a search, or maybe you're
wanting to build that pool of variability
[SPEAKER_00]: in which to do the search.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I wanted to begin with that
side where you're, I guess, an analogy for
[SPEAKER_00]: this is that you're widening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's widening and then there's
narrowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think breeding is this interplay of
widening possibilities and narrowing
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the widening, I guess one
characterization of it is breeding to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore and preserve and expand
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you guys wanted to say
just on that note of breeding to widen to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we still in the part where we just say
little bits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the one thing I'll say is that
cannabis itself, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a very wide variable plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like a lot of people talk about,
oh, that's just so bottlenecked and
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very few things I can reference
in my brain that have been hardcore
[SPEAKER_01]: bottlenecked other than things like,
you know, cookies has been shown to be
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to be bottlenecked genetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we're seeing like most the
one expression come out of all these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different gelato crosses or
gelato selfs, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's already a very variable
gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people talk about
bottlenecking and it's less of a concern
[SPEAKER_01]: overall than most people think as far as
like it might not be variable enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cannabis is pretty fricking variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people are breeding with
polyhygrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as much of a concern as most
people think it out to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this section for us is kind of
more of an academic approach where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to, you know, we'll kind of
artificially or not just assume that for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason, someone does want to
increase variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they did, you know, what are some
of the techniques that they could employ?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously you have something like
the concept of open pollination,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is largely known as a conservation
preservation technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you guys see that as one of the
techniques of actually increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: variability or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Loco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loco had a good answer on this when we
were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So open pollination, I feel like it's
really only ideal, like as you were
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, thousand kind of in a preservation
conservation type of scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think cannabis is a crop that,
you know, has to kind of be like
[SPEAKER_03]: directionally selected for at this point,
you know, because if you keep open
[SPEAKER_03]: pollinating something, you're just going
to lose traits, you know, by diluting them
[SPEAKER_03]: into, you know, instead of making it a one
to 10 chance of finding this, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you might change that into like one to 200
or one to 100 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: One to 10,000 in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's really one of the
biggest drawbacks to open pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, an alternative could be like a
quote unquote selective type open
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination, where you select a handful of
males and a handful of females or all the
[SPEAKER_03]: females or whatever, you know,
just because you're kind of weak.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not tweeting out anything that,
and again, this is all subjective and all
[SPEAKER_03]: personal because you're the person making
selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, obviously there's that
pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, really at the end of it,
it's just, you know, growing the progeny
[SPEAKER_03]: out because you won't know if you expanded
that gene pool until you actually see what
[SPEAKER_03]: it spit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you get back into the ability
or maybe even accidental by selecting one
[SPEAKER_01]: trait, you've removed the trait that you
want, you know, like any, and this can be
[SPEAKER_01]: done in open pollination, you know,
or it could be, you could actually screw
[SPEAKER_01]: it up by doing just a little bit of
selection by, ah, you know, this one harms
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take that one out and leave the rest
of these for the open pollination,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that one that hurts, maybe the one
that had scope traits that you were
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for, you just yanked it because it
hurt or didn't grow fast enough for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was a good one because you guys
actually answered one of the questions we
[SPEAKER_00]: had, which is from E, who did want to hear
about, in his words, not a full OP,
[SPEAKER_00]: but using multiple choice females and
males as your base stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, me and CSI discussed a lot of that
when we were doing the Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we leave in and what do we leave
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to take out some of the stuff
that we are pretty sure isn't nice growing
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe, you know, just different things
that we were seeing in it, like we were
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out, do we even touch
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we put our imprints on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the end, we decided to go
with, not I think, in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: we decided to go with just not touching it
because it wasn't ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We felt like it wasn't ours to touch in
the first place like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people wanted NL5 and a pure open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, no one had done,
you know, at least a 50 seed plus pop to
[SPEAKER_01]: make those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we wanted, instead of, you know,
the 10 seed pop that was being sold,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wanted to do a nice 50 seed look
through because that's what we had or we
[SPEAKER_01]: would have done more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else to add to this
idea of like open or maybe for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: better term, semi-open pollination?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another good example might be skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk 1 was said to be skunky when it came
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sam the Skunk Man himself says he did
not do anything but open successive open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinations on skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of us are familiar with skunk 1
now and what you're not going to find is
[SPEAKER_01]: skunkiness in skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find anything but that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he intentionally bred out the
skunkiness, but if he's intentionally
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding it out through open pollinations
where he's not selecting anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how that was achieved
intentionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may be what locals talking about,
successive open pollinations, accidentally
[SPEAKER_01]: removing a trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I assume also that that
approach probably sums up a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional, you know, cannabis plant
breeding in various like indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like semi-open every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They choose the best and then they chuck
them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess one thing I'll add is in kind of,
you know, conservation population
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics, there's this term called the
founder effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is pretty much going to be,
you know, the individuals and the
[SPEAKER_03]: frequency and distribution of alleles,
you know, in that population.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those are the founding genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic, you know, material donors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, what you have and if that,
you know, frequency for that certain trait
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't that common, then, you know,
that specific fragment that you're working
[SPEAKER_03]: with, you may have possibly isolated,
you know, that trait out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always wondered if that happened
with haze or, you know, like there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of them I wonder if that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sadly, you know, this isn't,
this right here is more so, this is an
[SPEAKER_03]: actual game of chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one thing to add to that
specific type of scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to predict what phenos the
seed is going to throw out by looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, you know, breeding is a game of
odds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a game of like frequencies,
statistical probabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the other point I want to move on to
within this section of like exploring,
[SPEAKER_00]: preserving and expanding variability,
we have, of course, out-crossing,
[SPEAKER_00]: outbreeding, hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm just curious, like on this one,
I mean, there's not a lot to say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone understands what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often would you out-cross just from
the, just from the get-go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like under what circumstances would you
just be like, Oh, I've started with this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, I'm just going to
immediately like cross it to something
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the times when I like,
thinking back to my career, most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: times when I would be out-crossing,
it was because I had a clone only
[SPEAKER_01]: selection and I didn't want to necessarily
feminize it because that plant won't
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse well, or for whatever reason I may
be doing, working on another reversal
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also like working with males a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do, because I think there's,
it's, it is harder in a sense that the
[SPEAKER_01]: male isn't necessarily showing the visual
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas females, they don't necessarily do
that either, but you get a much better
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of their, their resin production,
the kind of sense in that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know what to look for on an art,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But with males, it is, it is tends to be
more of an art form.
[SPEAKER_01]: In what you do, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess like one way I could look at
what you just said is you can sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridize to actually get more
information, obviously, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the crosses, you, you will start
to see like what's actually being passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, if you've got males,
that's one of the only ways you can know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's being passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is obviously if one,
one strain has one or a few or one
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable trait that you like in the,
in another strain has other desirable
[SPEAKER_01]: traits you like, and you want them both to
be a single strain, that's the other
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose for hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main purpose I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local, anything you want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Outcrossing, outbreeding, hybridization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hybridization part, I mean,
it's, you know, if you kind of know like
[SPEAKER_03]: the parent material, you know,
and you, you know, whatever you popped a
[SPEAKER_03]: few and you can see it's relatively kind
of, I guess this is obviously a
[SPEAKER_03]: hypothetical situation, but you see that
it's a rather IVL, you know, I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: the smartest decision would be to,
you know, breed it with itself again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's obviously like kind of a case where
you'd want to hybridize so that you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: lose some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't, I had a question here,
which I wasn't very sure of, and I didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really understand how to approach
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna, I'm gonna let you guys have
a go at it, but in terms of variability
[SPEAKER_00]: and having a pool to search through,
are there techniques that allow you to dig
[SPEAKER_00]: into recessives more than otherwise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we're going to get recessives
coming through, you know, it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already mentioned heterozygosity kind
of pervasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, it's not like you're not going to
see recessives in any generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are there, have y'all like experience
actually looking for recessives?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I just hear a New Zealander say y'all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do say y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a weirdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you said use otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like use guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: S1s are the, one of my favorite places to
see recesses and outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like specifically, selfing is one of the
quickest ways to see outliers in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a funny thing about selfing,
because on the one hand, you obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a good tool for locking things in or
narrowing, but on the other hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's an element of it where you
also will find weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us refer to it as a double edged
sword because you're going to see high
[SPEAKER_01]: ceiling, low floor in a lot of S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get, we'll come back to our
selfing again in the narrowing section.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, local, anything on recessives
and like looking at like looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive traits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would just add on to the S1.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's the most effective way to
actually lock in any sort of recessive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, one thing that I've seen,
you know, rather recently, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, Bitter did the S1,
F2 of the P91.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like that in itself, I feel is
like, is isolating, you know, recessive
[SPEAKER_03]: traits or maybe not even recessive,
but desirable traits within a selective,
[SPEAKER_03]: selected phenome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are going to want to hear about
that again, I think when we get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: locking in section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a, I had a random one just to
kind of tie this section up because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know much about it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure if it necessarily fits
in here, but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ask it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cheese, Cheese wants to know about
ploidy manipulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like the culture scene and like that's
that, I don't think that fits in any of
[SPEAKER_01]: these scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: People manipulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ploidism with, with, do you have
anything there local?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to say, um, you know,
really the only way we can fuck around
[SPEAKER_03]: with it is by, you know, treating it with,
you know, harsh chemicals to induce that
[SPEAKER_03]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I will say that it isn't uncommon
for certain species to express express
[SPEAKER_03]: different ploidy levels, depending on like
elevation or whatever, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, I don't want to say it
does, but I also don't want to say it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't occur in cannabis, you know,
and maybe you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there, are there ploidy isms that you
can, I don't even know if that's a correct
[SPEAKER_01]: word, but are there like polyploids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you identify them visually?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I was actually reading a bit,
um, because I saw this specific question
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was like, okay, you know,
I have worked with, um, a PI that has
[SPEAKER_03]: studied like polyploidism, um,
in relation to like environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, she works in the Sonora desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to obviously be elevation
type based stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and there is some correlation,
you know, things that are higher in
[SPEAKER_03]: elevation may have more chromosomes or
less chromosomes depending.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can you, is there anything about
ploidism that you can like in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can say, ah, that's a polyploid
visually without being tested?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not 100%, but I was reading this paper
and they were saying apparently that there
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to be less domata and larger
stomata per leaf area that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still need a microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not something you can like
physically see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you'd kind of have to study it at
the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I see that online a lot,
like on Instagram where people be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a polyploid and like, let's show a
plant that like has like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: weird branching or something like you got
a polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, you see that with people
who have like, uh, associations as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, those, those don't
necessarily reduce to polyploidism.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not correlated to polyploidism.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I guess polyploidism polyploidy
polyploidy is specifically like a
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomal thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not, that's what it actually
corresponds to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just kind of a fun one to
check in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to correct that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's polyploidy not polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an ugly word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I blame the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latent words just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we move on to what I think most
people think of as breeding where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying, well, that's not true,
but anyway, uh, breeding to narrow down
[SPEAKER_00]: and lock in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the easiest or most
straightforward one to begin with maybe is
[SPEAKER_00]: like regular filleting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So siblings have the same progeny lot
generation intimated to produce new
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where I guess you can kind of
see like recurrent selections,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, in successive generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would either of you like to kick us off on
like just this, this method in general for
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to preserve something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, lock, lock something in,
I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so obviously we're going to start with
their seed pop, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so this is something that's,
you know, very goal oriented.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, you kind of have to have a goal to
make things and move things forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so you want to make sure that you have
an idea where you want to go and you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure that you can identify these
traits and move those traits forward by,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in this case, we're working with
the regular population, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this may be one way to do it,
but it isn't an answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, some people may look for
male plants that do look, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: morphologically similar to a female
counterpart, you know, and maybe you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: cross those two together and hope that
those progeny are going to be consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: for that morphological, you know,
shape, but also those flower morphology
[SPEAKER_03]: traits, you know, because we do smoke
flower and we don't grow it specifically,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, for shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, that's kind of one way you
could maybe approach that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or maybe you can, um, cross,
you know, one narrow, one broad,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and see what comes out of that
and try to find something in between,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it, it depends the goal really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be, you know, in that
scenario, their goal would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, something that looks quote unquote
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the goal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with a, that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of did want to ask here,
cause I don't know about this much myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what's the, within filial breeding and
generational kind of, um, moving things
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, what is the difference between
picking like one male and one female for
[SPEAKER_00]: each generation and picking like a few of
each in each generation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when would you kind of go with one as
opposed to the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I don't like to do multiple
pairings and then mixing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind doing multiple pairings and
keeping the seed segregated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know what each parent is offering,
but like in many situations, when I see
[SPEAKER_01]: people doing, um, like multiple females
and multiple males, what they'll do is do
[SPEAKER_01]: the cross and then combine all the seeds
and call it all one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, like that's fine, but I
wouldn't do it because like each one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those different parents is going to be
taking it in a slightly different
[SPEAKER_01]: direction with different traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Combining it all together would be calling
this, oh, this is that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like in my case, because I sell
seeds, I like my customers to know what to
[SPEAKER_01]: expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to be very precise with that,
it, to me, it should always be one-to-one
[SPEAKER_01]: pairings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's people who disagree with me on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is just a philosophical kind of
standpoint for a lot of breeders where
[SPEAKER_01]: they stand on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why it's such an
interesting question because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: right answer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're looking, I guess, at trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess this is like the difference
between like mass, I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: right term is mass or group selection in
filial breeding versus one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so let's say you're an average seed
buyer, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you're getting maybe one to
two packs of something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that first pull, you're going to
want to do a, you know, not an open
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination, but like some kind of
selective open pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can search through more if you
genuinely have intentions of searching for
[SPEAKER_03]: something in that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, um, what was the
question again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess like the difference between
one-to-one filial breeding where you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose one male and one female,
um, and choosing multiple males and
[SPEAKER_00]: females per generation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you want to open that pool up,
that's when you'd maybe want to use a more
[SPEAKER_03]: broad broader pool of individuals,
but kind of, you know, me after the F2,
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I would kind of just take it
one direction or the other and nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: really in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause then like, what's the point of
searching through an F3, finding
[SPEAKER_03]: something, two things that are polar
opposite, and then keep crossing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a further prompt here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what about the situation where you
are choosing multiples, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing them for very similar traits?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't see the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just, I would just take clones of
one, you know, and just fill a term with
[SPEAKER_01]: clones of one as opposed to multiple.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of something that I find
it's, um, I don't want to say it's
[SPEAKER_03]: relevant, but kind of relevant to my
current situation is I'm growing the,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, electric Boogaloo cross to the
Appalachia, Appalachia, Appalachia,
[SPEAKER_03]: however we want to say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the name of that line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, good old Mountain Dew from high and
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, it's interesting because
there seems to be three, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what we'll call frequencies, you know,
things that are obviously very sativa,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, things that are somewhat,
you know, sativa, but didn't stretch as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as the things that were obviously
very sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are these plants that
didn't stretch whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the way that I'm kind of looking at
it is you kind of have these three types,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you have to find that individual
within those types, essentially,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, kind of fulfill that purpose,
you know, so it's, you know, selecting
[SPEAKER_03]: within isolated, you know, fragments
within a group.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a good, good, good anecdote.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, was there anything else that you two
wanted to say about regular filial
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just goes back to, again,
knowing your starting material,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're going to do filial breeding,
like you want to know what you're working
[SPEAKER_01]: with and be, be sure of what you're
working with because your filial breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: is a several year, several step long
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to really like take it several
generations in, you don't want to go spend
[SPEAKER_01]: five years on something and be
disappointed because you found out it has
[SPEAKER_01]: crap, the shit or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on we, we will, we will,
I think, um, get to talk about situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: situations in which you should stop or
even go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, for now we're going to move on to
a pet topic, which is self helping and
[SPEAKER_00]: using selfing to narrow down, lock in
certain traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, when it comes to selfing,
there are several different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we talked about some of these last
time in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did in terms of techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use many of those techniques
that we refer to any one of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever works best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have, you know, amazing luck
with colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, um, you know, that's usually the
one most people go to because it sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: the easiest to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I highly recommend an STS phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you do reversals, most of the
time you're going to be narrowing the pool
[SPEAKER_01]: much faster, or actually all the time
you're going to be narrowing the pool much
[SPEAKER_01]: faster in a selfing situation than you
would be by outcrossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously you're bringing in an outcross,
new genetic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's a filial generation
breeding of the same line, by selfing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, almost like a fast forward game
genie type jumping through genetic uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you'd say that,
genetic segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping genetic time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetic time machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's also much more predictable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Than filial breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's targeted specific, like faster,
um, segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, going back to the,
bringing, bringing back like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was problematizing earlier with
Mendel's science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that's one of the reasons why
selfing is so big in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't, again, we don't have
access to, um, true breeding parents a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we don't have access to true breeding
traits, um, most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So selfing is one of the ways you can kind
of get around the lack of predictability
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that that is a reason that
people make FEMC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is probably taken into
account by maybe 1% of the people who make
[SPEAKER_01]: self-seeds, um, uniformity or what they're
putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mostly that is, uh, it's popular
realistically because people like to save
[SPEAKER_01]: space and don't like males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's much easier for them not to look
for males or learn how to select males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's tends to be why most people make
FEMCs is because it sells for that reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: not because, uh, isolating anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess like whether they know it or
not, there is a distinct advantage from
[SPEAKER_00]: the other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Loco, anything you want to say on just
like selfing in general, um, in this
[SPEAKER_00]: context of locking in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise we have, we have quite a good
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I mean, other than, you know,
it gives you the ability to tap into
[SPEAKER_03]: certain, you know, recessives that might
be desirable, you know, really that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is going to be the most effective way
to achieve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I guess if you're thinking about
it, you know, at a, um, molecular levels,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're kind of just stacking these things
on top of each other, making the chance of
[SPEAKER_03]: something popping up significantly higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can move on to end the wins
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now I look at it, uh,
maybe split into two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: First part is, have we seen many S3 like
lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you start trying to reverse
at the S2, there tends to be a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: issues with reversals at S2 that we found,
um, in S2 populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, we don't know why
necessarily, cause we're not like looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at it at the molecular level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually just looking at it from the
visual expression level and going,
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why doesn't this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: But realistically, it kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with the, as you dig into the
recessives more, more things are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: scrambled and you know, like some things
don't reverse well, some things do reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, the more you inbreed,
the less likely things are looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse well, at least with the lines
we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, um, as you inbreed further,
you are endangering essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: fitness of the, um, of the material,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the, and the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if autosomes are controlling some of
this, um, even though, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: autosomes are the nonsexual chromosomes,
even though they are not sexual,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might be helping control some of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot in, in selfing with the
recessives and that is just, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of variability, a lot of things that could
be controlling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't personally understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I know we said at the beginning,
but again, I am far from a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very layman's terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas my, my buddy, Loco here actually
went to school, you know, like that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may be using some odd words to
people, apologies to the science community
[SPEAKER_01]: for destroying everything I'm saying.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Loco, anything you want to add to
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise I can move on to the next part
of the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, so Matt was saying that,
you know, you're obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: stacking these genes on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, it's kind of like fast
forwarding in genetic time, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a few generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that this isn't at the extreme
of an F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, you know, something more and more
isolated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as you isolate these things,
more deleterious alleles have higher
[SPEAKER_03]: chances of popping up and, you know,
things, you know, not reversing paths.
[SPEAKER_03]: S2 could be just a symptom of inbreeding
depression, you know, through rapid
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, it may be the things we
were selecting as well, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to choose to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe if you took like,
uh, let's say a super mega polyhybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: like animal mints, like if you go on seed
finder, for example, and look at the tree,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's like 90 feet long, because it's
just a bunch of polyhybrid stacked on each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in that case, taking that to S2
might have a higher chance of reversals
[SPEAKER_01]: because just so many, you know,
it's so over, you know, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously some of these, um, you know,
depressions, you know, that we see aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: always going to be physical traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of cry babies, big things
are plant hormones and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and that can, that obviously has
so much to do with why the plant does
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much all the shit it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, yeah, it not reversing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might just mean that it doesn't have
the genetic capability to these said
[SPEAKER_03]: levels of hormones or regulate,
you know, that exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll reframe the next part of in the
wind's question, um, to say, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: because as, as you mentioned that we not,
we haven't really seen S3s, but have we
[SPEAKER_00]: seen many instances of, uh, S2s or S1s
being crossed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the vibe there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I know that me and CSI,
like, we found some of our best stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: like a self sisters cross to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, let's say you pop, uh,
a pack of, for example, California orange
[SPEAKER_01]: S1s, we would take, uh, one selection that
we really like from the California orange
[SPEAKER_01]: S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we find another selection that we
really like for another reason from the
[SPEAKER_01]: California orange S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we cross those, we won't
necessarily be getting what's called an S2
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not, it's not necessarily
self.
[SPEAKER_01]: Self would be using the same exact
expression onto itself, but this is two
[SPEAKER_01]: different expressions from the same line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and CSI refer to this as an F2
reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not necessarily the proper
terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not scientific terminology,
but we needed something to denote like
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing in what stage we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not necessarily self.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is technically a filial generation of
sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a reversal and I like denoting
reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people understand that something was
reversed in the process so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that it's more, um,
narrow as it were than using like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, other material out cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in that sense, like we are,
I can think of so many examples,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, where we're crossing two sisters,
two sisters from the same line in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a filial generation just brings out
amazing this, um, a great example would be
[SPEAKER_01]: bitter when he took my P91 S1s and found
two selections of like from that and made
[SPEAKER_01]: the P91, um, F2R I believe it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seriously was so much better than
the original starting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so much better than anything I saw
in the S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not uncommon for that to happen
in these feminized hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go, go ahead, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, oh, I was just going to say that it,
you know, it's pretty cool to kind of grow
[SPEAKER_03]: those lines out because it kind of like,
how do I say this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It locks things in while opening things up
in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds counterintuitive, but that's
almost what it does because like the sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: pea, for example, like everything had
copious amounts of resin, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, everything, um, smells,
you know, two kind of smells, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dopey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one that was lean nutty,
you know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that point, it was just picking a
plant that vibed with you really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think those are really fun lines to
hunt because you can kind of, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do I say this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't think personalize it is,
is really the way to put it, but kind of,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, adapt it to your, your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then there's also,
you know, like the, the feminized hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's not sisters and it's two
different clones crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also found amazing stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I tend to like the sister to sister
more than just the, um, two different
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that is more of a, let's see what
happens type scenario for the most part
[SPEAKER_01]: with the, the clone of clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I mean, like for that example,
the, the, uh, reverse train wreck onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz blue dream, I think that's
become one of the favorites in our group.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and this is, it was better than
either parent in my opinion on their own
[SPEAKER_01]: combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made for something better than both
parents, which is, it's not always common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess to bring it back to the,
um, the section on like narrowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: locking in, would you all say that
selfing, and I don't know if I'm wrenching
[SPEAKER_00]: the science here, but would you all say
that selfing, um, give us a, a better
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of actually having something that's
true of breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe the last question, uh,
last part of this question is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you kind of alluded to this,
when you cross two S ones, do you,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you expect a, um, a little boost in
vigor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, is that a way to offset some of this
inbreeding depression?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, and I'll say just anecdotally,
specifically with the P-91 one,
[SPEAKER_01]: P-91 was very, very, very, uh,
the reason it was given to me is because
[SPEAKER_01]: the dude who had it, the very last cut,
he was like, this is dying on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no vigor left in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was really no resin production
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it definitely restored vigor to,
uh, an almost obsolete cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that sense, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like the line, we have a vigorous
line that represents P-91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you want to add to that local?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is there anything else we want to
say about selfing in the context of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, locking in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just that it's the most effective for
me, in my opinion, it's the most effective
[SPEAKER_01]: way of, of breeding to lock in traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, however, it can be done with mills as
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sometimes it's a lot more luck or a
lot more, um, experiential, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we haven't really been
constraining this conversation to be about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding at smaller scales, I think those
of you who are interested in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can already see what the advantages
are in using something like selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you don't have that much time,
space, numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did the most of my selfing work was
when I was, uh, blowing up apartments,
[SPEAKER_01]: like multiple apartments, cause it was
small spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like obviously I could knock down walls in
these apartments so I couldn't like join
[SPEAKER_01]: them together and make a bigger space out
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lot of different small spaces
with low electricity loads in those old
[SPEAKER_01]: ass apartments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did a lot of selfing during those
years and it was highly effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: highly effective way of doing small space
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that will be a juicy morsel for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what I will add or, um,
is, you know, if you're a first time
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder, it might not be the worst idea to
kind of start with that because it gives
[SPEAKER_03]: you an accurate measure of what you're
actually working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have direct, you know,
representation of something that may be
[SPEAKER_03]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that may be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go into another, I wouldn't say a
favorite topic, but maybe like a pet peeve
[SPEAKER_00]: more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can say that for whatever
reason, there's a common misconception
[SPEAKER_00]: that back crossing is just about locking
stuff in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in actuality, it's a little bit more,
the context for it is a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back crossing in proper terms is you
trying to incorporate a single trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: a single new trait into a recurrent parent
that's already stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real function of back crossing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we go back to the idea that the
likelihood of you having a true breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: recurrent parent is already very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already kind of partly undermines this
whole enterprise one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, the possibility of you having
another true breeding parent that's true
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for this one trait that you're
trying to bring in to the other parent is
[SPEAKER_00]: also extremely low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, we're kind of, I think that's
why back crossing as a concept in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is so confused is because one,
people misunderstand what it actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: meant to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, people don't even have the
correct starting conditions to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I wanted to introduce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything y'all would add to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that there are lots of
anecdotes about like people's myths about
[SPEAKER_00]: back crossing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the biggest examples,
or the most commonly used examples of back
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing being massively successful is
Cinderella 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some of the first examples in
cannabis of people saying like,
[SPEAKER_01]: check out my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is VX1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually like 33% Cinderella,
you know, princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is 75% princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one's actually 99% princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since the genetics have been back
crossed this many times, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be 99% princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always going to see princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in theory, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: In practicality, it did not work at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: C99 has many, many phenos and expressions
and traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are some that occur more
regularly, like the grapefruit,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pineapple, but there's a lot more than
that there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, it was a fine example of how
back crossing is used incorrectly,
[SPEAKER_01]: understood, like totally misunderstood,
like calling it like a 99% princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like these simple crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter what you use, as long as
you're just back crossing, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get 99%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how shit works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, most people throw that out
as an example of how back crossing was
[SPEAKER_01]: A-OK successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, it was like the opposite,
like the perfect proof of why.
[SPEAKER_01]: A perfect example of how misunderstood
back crossing is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I really don't think that there
is a need to go really past the first back
[SPEAKER_03]: cross really now, because again,
in a back cross, you should really know
[SPEAKER_03]: the starting material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, let's take blue bonnet,
for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's something that's extremely
stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that, you know,
I would feel confident using it in a back
[SPEAKER_03]: cross because like it just has visible
traits that like, you know, you can link
[SPEAKER_03]: as we were kind of chatting about earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like if that plant is stable,
then in that first generation,
[SPEAKER_03]: you should be able to find what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're getting more than what
you want, like, do you even know what
[SPEAKER_03]: genes you're targeting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a goal in mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a little more complex than
just hitting the reoccurrent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Parent or whatever each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll add into like in the theory of
back crossing, we are trying usually,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually like when I'm doing a back cross,
especially like a blue bonnet and say blue
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet BX1.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am trying to find an out cross parent
that is going to bring more stability to
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not necessarily in a BX1 going to
go wild with the out cross or go something
[SPEAKER_01]: like totally opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless the trade I'm looking for is
something in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's true breeding too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can absolutely bring that trade
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take something completely different
and bring it into your back cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can go any number of ways, any number
of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not effectively back crossing
at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just kind of playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll kind of paraphrase this all
differently, which is that often in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, your individual plant that is
you want to use the recurrent parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual plant that you want to use
as the, like, I think they call it like
[SPEAKER_00]: introgressive parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're likely to be largely heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are using heterozygous
material, you're not going to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted results based on the model of
back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's just, yeah, that's just how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you want to say
about back crossing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we seen many successful examples of
it in the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's a good example of a BX1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say myself, but I can't,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say an example of, let's see,
a failed BX1 maybe for my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the Platinum Banana OG BX1,
I used a outcross, it was a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I hate even admitting this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an outcross of cookies and cream
Banana OG, and my goal was to keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana OG dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked good in some of the crosses,
but what I found was that cookies and
[SPEAKER_01]: cream tended to dominate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the outcross, but it was so
dominant and so different that it really
[SPEAKER_01]: brought too much variability into what I
was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like a lot of those,
while they were decent and they made great
[SPEAKER_01]: lines and there was banana popping out a
ton, it wasn't what I wanted from a BX1
[SPEAKER_01]: line, so I consider it a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure it's easier to throw myself under
the bus than other people, so let's find
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I think in many ways you
could probably think of many back crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: that are definitely not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can think of about 30 off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we won't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're getting close to the end of
this section on an overview of various
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques for both widening and
narrowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, it doesn't really fit
anywhere, but I wondered if you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: say anything about population-based
breeding as a concept and how it may or
[SPEAKER_00]: may not fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll start with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really fortunate to be able to hold
on to things in vegetative state for
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking ever, essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that in itself kind of eliminates the
need to... That really defeats the need
[SPEAKER_03]: to...
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, I lost my...
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice one, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: More editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so since we do have the ability to
keep things around for an indefinite
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time theory, it doesn't really
push us to study populations because we
[SPEAKER_03]: can just hold this thing onto for the rest
of our lives, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very fortunate to have, but what
happens in the instance that we lose these
[SPEAKER_03]: things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there should kind of be a push for
population-type breeding so that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: recover that thing that has been lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And population-type could obviously
include S1-type breeding because at the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of it, your S1s are going to be a
population, a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just be basic here and kind of ask
you to even just outline what population
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, that's just going to take into
consideration into selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to weed things out to improve the
population and move things forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: In agriculture, I feel like a lot of the
breeding has been forward and hasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really focused on conserving things,
but in moving things forward, there is
[SPEAKER_03]: progression, but at the loss of certain
genes that maybe we can't recover anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we seen... So would you say that
like... And maybe I'm just reiterating an
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier point that was already made,
but would you say that most of traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in cannabis has been population
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pre-modern, I guess,
is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I couldn't really say because I
really don't know the whole anthropology
[SPEAKER_03]: of old world cannabis and how it moves off
the world, and I don't want to make
[SPEAKER_03]: stories up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then this would just be a gesture
towards this other kind of possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we won't go too deep into it,
but yeah, it's an interesting point to
[SPEAKER_00]: make, I think, nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for me, this is kind of the end
of this overview of breeding techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: and strategies, and I wanted to move into
this section on what makes breeding so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard, but I think a good segue here is
something that we've obviously talked
[SPEAKER_00]: implicitly about, but we haven't actually
addressed it in and of itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is making selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously an integral part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, where do we even begin
with... I want people to start... Maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't say I want people to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I think of my plants in a
breeding context.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of each individual plant,
and I'm not talking about strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about each individual plant as
a tool, and each tool has a different set
[SPEAKER_01]: of traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go and plan a project,
I'm considering what traits I have
[SPEAKER_01]: available, and I'm also considering where
I would like to go, and a lot of times I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even necessarily consider what I
have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of something like cinnamon,
for example, just a single scent,
[SPEAKER_01]: a single trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I come up with that with the tools
I have available?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many steps would it take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly, is it possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not, reassess my goals or find
plants that I know will get me to the
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think of each plant like a tool in
that sense, or like a brush, a different
[SPEAKER_01]: brush you can use to paint a different
picture, in other words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a funny one because I see questions
where people are like, how do you select?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, sure, we can give
principles, but this is really where it
[SPEAKER_00]: does become more about the art,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think both of you alluded to
earlier, so much of it is about what you
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself want, need, what your
environmental pressures are dictating for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, what your starting material is
already constraining you to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't really a silver bullet for
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't really like a casual answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also one other thing that we
haven't really discussed, and that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: invariable or intangibles, the intangible
traits of smoking effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking for effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a trait that is not just
intangible, meaning you can't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: touch it, feel it, observe it with most of
your senses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sense, it's a whole different sense
that we don't really normally tap into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just individual per person,
it's individual per set and setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have different effects from the
same exact growth, the same exact strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same exact bud, and the same exact
pipe, and not finish the bowl,
[SPEAKER_01]: and get a completely different effect from
it at a different time in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you're really stressed versus
when you were earlier that morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were totally in a good mood,
blah, blah, blah, smoking, everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: fine, happy, chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get home from work, you're super
stressed, you got a lot of caffeine that
[SPEAKER_01]: day, and you smoke, and it's a completely
different effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're getting more anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're getting more paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Effect is the intangible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the most, in my opinion,
one of the most important parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding in cannabis and probably the
hardest to quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to definitely bring that up at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when we were talking yesterday
in preparation for this, you also
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned like you wanted to talk about
applying proper observation techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling variables and ensuring that
everything that you observe is relative to
[SPEAKER_00]: stable, you know, observational
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's another key part of
making selections is like how consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: are you growing these plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: How consistent is your environment,
et cetera?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I touched on that earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing like seed buyers don't
usually take into account that I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: also very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a breeder, I take this into account
when I'm making seeds and who I sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to and how I sell them to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is where are your seeds being made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or who are you breeding for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's your target audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: More, that's more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is your target audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this seed you're going to be sharing
with your friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these seeds you're making for
yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor seeds made indoor for indoor people
is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds made indoor tend to do well for
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to do well going outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, seeds made outdoor don't always
do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's say I'm a breeder and I'm
making all my seeds outdoor and my
[SPEAKER_01]: customers are 90% indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you're going to see a lot of
problems with people saying, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff keeps herming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's completely different
environments where they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: acclimated, completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a super important part to
consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who is your audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, who is your audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: How serious are you going to take this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just for you and your friends,
are you going to worry about pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination as much?
[SPEAKER_01]: As you would, if you're selling these
seeds where people are paying good money
[SPEAKER_01]: for them and these are customers that you
want to keep very happy, or is it just
[SPEAKER_01]: your friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: The target audience is another super
important part when you're going through
[SPEAKER_01]: your breeding goals and what I'm who's my
intended user end user of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'll point out something
really obvious, which is that your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding goals obviously will at least
majorly dictate your selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not lined up, then
something's obviously wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something's just to point out the
obvious, just to point out the obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to zoom out of it and just re
situate us when what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, this is kind of more of a
summary section and kind of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: situate some of the principles and
techniques we've already outlined in a
[SPEAKER_00]: more practical sense and kind of address
this question of like, what are all the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexities and nuances of breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've covered like why we can't
straightforwardly apply the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered the difficulties in actually
knowing your starting material and all
[SPEAKER_00]: your plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've covered applying proper observation
techniques and Matt just addressed like
[SPEAKER_00]: the complexities and setting even goals
for yourself when you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one really big one that is
worth talking about when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulty is just how much time and how
expensive this whole endeavor can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, and I talk about this a
lot in other episodes, but when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to reversals, early on, there wasn't a lot
of us doing them in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was often called like the few of us
that were doing reverse, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking the cheap route,
you're taking the easy route.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the shortcut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But realistically, like there's so much
failure in reversals and that it is very
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fail at a reversal and you don't
have a backup and keeping backups is
[SPEAKER_01]: tricky because that's when you may
encounter pollen contamination if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't time it correctly or have it spaced
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very expensive process,
whether you're doing male to female or
[SPEAKER_01]: feminize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found it much, much, much more
expensive and costly with feminization
[SPEAKER_01]: only because of the failure rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy not to fail as far as
pollen taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: In male to female breeding, but in
actually doing breeding when I'm also
[SPEAKER_01]: saying failure, it's did you meet your
goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another part where it can get
very expensive if you're very goal
[SPEAKER_01]: oriented and you have an end goal and
you're sticking to it and you're and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working to that goal no matter what
it takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more numbers you run, the better the
chance you are of finding something you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a really good
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good distinction
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's the kind of like mechanical
failures and execution of the techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: or steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're the failures to actually
meet goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are actually quite distinct,
although, of course, they're connected.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a we had a question here about
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from Farmer Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we had an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asks, how do you know when to work a
line and when to leave it alone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, when do you stop go back instead of
just pressing on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you two mentioned to me,
you know, like Heinlein, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: had had to go back with his Appalachia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of those things that like,
you know, a lot of people talk about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not a lot of people actually go back
multiple generations and take the time or
[SPEAKER_01]: even make the observations like I've run
enough of this stuff myself and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: decided this isn't a good representation
of what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to put out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to release these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and go back to the
F2 when I'm already at F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three generations to take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and start back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time I saw a population that I'm
really happy with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to see if I can reselect
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so few times I've seen this,
and especially when someone's worked
[SPEAKER_01]: something up to F5, jump back to F2,
work it back up in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a trait of a real breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an absolute trait of a real breeder
to be that goal oriented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, it's not very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the major reasons I look
up to Highland so much is because he is
[SPEAKER_01]: that goal oriented and willing to do the
hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is where it comes to like
your breeding philosophy, your ethics,
[SPEAKER_00]: your professionalism, all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, we're coming to like an end of
sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was just this section was kind of
just like us zooming out and looking back
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to summarize some of the
difficulties in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I want to say here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't meant to discourage or
demotivate people or dishearten people
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think really, for me anyway,
in kind of like sort of producing this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, I think I just saw that there was
a big gap in the discourse around breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: where people don't really talk about these
gaps and complexities and nuances that
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're an amateur enthusiast like
me and you Google cannabis breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the stuff that you see that comes up
in your top results are going to be like
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time, you're going to get
like European Seabanks with their like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the same blog post being copied
like over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to address just the most
basic Mendelian stuff that we went over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there anything else in terms of
like practical difficulties that you two
[SPEAKER_00]: want to add to this mix of like,
you know, what makes the shit hard?
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes it hard?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in like, this is a lot of the reason I
kind of keep going back to the blue
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet, but it's one of those really,
really rare lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been hard to explain this to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope this episode helps illustrate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a male that is true breeding
for a trait that is a very desirable
[SPEAKER_01]: trait, but also most representations of
that line specifically are low potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: low resin production, or not super high
resin production filled with oils and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came with so many other good traits
that it also breeds true for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only does it breed true for
blueberry, it breeds true for a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the key to me first that I
realized that it probably wasn't a pure
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry line because it was vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a lot of traits that aren't even
existing in blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and it breeds true for those
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was heavily worked, but it wasn't
heavily worked in a direction that was so
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred that I'm seeing mutations
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it was missing a lot of the
mutations that commonly pop up in
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry, but it still had extreme
blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also why I have a hard time moving on
from blue bonnet stuff, because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: find something that true breeding,
I just don't know of any other tooling
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis quite like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't run into it as far as males
go, as far as for regular breeding goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to explain to people what is so
special about the work that Lone Star did
[SPEAKER_01]: is very hard because people just say,
it's just someone took blueberry and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anybody could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't able to do it like he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many years of trying, running a lot of
the progeny, making the crosses,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could never get it past just blueberry
turps without and I couldn't bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency and I couldn't bring any resin
production with it, even in out crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of special stuff that can
be done in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a way to make true breeding
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be done, but it takes a ton of
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not to, again, not to
discourage anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to encourage you to do more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to encourage you and say that this
can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is special stuff like that out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did try to make that tool available
for everyone and left it in a nursery for
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody to use that male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I felt like when you find
something that's special in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you sit on it, you're kind of a prick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very special tool that everybody
should be able to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blueberry has very, that scent for
whatever reason, has very medical
[SPEAKER_01]: applications that come along with it,
in my opinion, and for a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it, whether it's anti-anxiety,
nerve pain relief, pain relief period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with those medical applications to
sit on that would be super selfish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried, but the nursery in the middle
of giving it HBLV, so it no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do believe that people find stuff
like that, share it, share it,
[SPEAKER_01]: give it to the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding tools like that can open,
shift people's paradigms on what can be
[SPEAKER_01]: achieved and accomplished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even the best at what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could imagine what something like
that would do in someone super competent
[SPEAKER_01]: or someone super creative's hands,
someone that thinks much differently than
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's good that you keep
drawing our attention to the Blue Bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we mentioned, it is rare to find
something that has relatively fixed traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that do pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to restate again, it's not
flashing my buttons and like bragging
[SPEAKER_01]: about Blue Bonnet because it's not my
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've done work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That line is not my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was done by someone else named Lone
Star from Texas Resin Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more to shine a spotlight on him
and his work and his contributions to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loco, was there anything else you wanted
to add on this kind of like summary of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the complexities of breeding and what
makes it difficult, at least from this
[SPEAKER_00]: general level?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll just say make sure that what
you're hunting and wanting to breed with
[SPEAKER_03]: is something that you're genuinely excited
about because, you know, as soon as you
[SPEAKER_03]: lose interest in something, you kind of
lose motivation and where to take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to also understand that each plant is
a tool, like Matt was saying, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, me, for example, when I was
doing seed pops, it's like I was trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: find the thing that was most comparable to
Sweet Pea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you realize this isn't the way to
hunt because like, you know, Sweet Pea is
[SPEAKER_03]: its own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: These other plants, they're not related.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, why am I looking for this and
this when that's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: not what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are like quite a few
different, we haven't really dived into
[SPEAKER_00]: this too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've implied a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of interesting
psychological phenomena when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things you have to overcome,
whether it's like the stress of knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're doing these like big gambles,
whether it's about tension within yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: about what your goals are or what material
you should be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so many interesting,
like, yeah, psychological side effects to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think failure and the ability,
like the one thing I see the most that
[SPEAKER_01]: people have the most trouble with,
and it was what we talked about at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, was being really, really honest
with oneself about how you spent your
[SPEAKER_01]: money on your seeds, what you have,
who made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because you've invested money
into it, does it mean it's what you want
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Confirmation bias is a huge cost fallacy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's nothing else that you two want
to add, I did have a couple of community
[SPEAKER_00]: questions just to tie this bit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone who was an overnight sensation
in the discord is no longer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know whether they're like
real or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asked what fundamental breeding skills
deserve more attention than most people
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, most people think that they
are well-researched because they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: high times magazine or because they
back-read a forum that is one of the few
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the many that were existing that
they think might have the best data
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's old and that's not
necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just have the most successful
seed bank attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be the most successful marketing,
SEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's still around and
survived the much better forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So research is just, if you don't do it,
you never know where you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just, God, it's so hard to say
this, but you're really in many senses
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to breeding, you're just
playing and giving yourself bad data
[SPEAKER_01]: points or not bad data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause every data point is a data point,
but maybe no more null data points because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to toss them out at
some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you, Lokel?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one, uh, research is obviously,
you know, really important because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not knowing what your baselines
are kind of just, you know, voids
[SPEAKER_03]: everything out because you can't compare
something like you can't trace ancestry,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and no matter what Filo says
exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to interject going to Filo's
looking at their data is not research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it has been proven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, that has to do with the
whole provenance thing, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: one thing that kind of like resonated with
me between this community and like the
[SPEAKER_03]: science community is in quantitative
genetics, you know, we kind of have a
[SPEAKER_03]: similar goal of like being able to tell
what something is based off of growing
[SPEAKER_03]: generations, not just like one plant,
but multiple generations, parental,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, F1 F2, you know,
in crosses all that because like,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more information you have,
you know, with these populations,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more it tells you about what your
starting material was, but not only that,
[SPEAKER_03]: it tells you what's behind your starting
material because beyond a certain point,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the story just ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't know what happens before
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess ultimately you just want as
much information as you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you can get it, whether it's via
provenance, whether it's via progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want, you want to maximize your
information space before you begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good information because there's just so
much bad information and Matt in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: maximizing your information space isn't
necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maximizing your reliable information
space, which is the hardest part,
[SPEAKER_01]: hardest part to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes back to the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're kind of coming to the end of
this episode and just to remind people
[SPEAKER_00]: what the intention was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intention was really to set the scene
to set the tone of like, where does the
[SPEAKER_00]: theory get us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does it not get us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the practical
complexities of breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the trade-offs of some of the
individual techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have not addressed, obviously,
is any specific scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there are going to be
breeding scenarios where obviously you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need a combination of these
techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is going to increase the complexity
yet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't approached those things
yet, but I think our goal for the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes, I don't know how many there will
be, is to, and I haven't decided on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm assuming it's either to cover
historical projects where there's a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from them or to cover hypothetical
breeding projects where we can continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: tease out some of the nuances,
some of the possible approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think as you all are gathering,
like there's so many possible permutations
[SPEAKER_00]: of techniques that you could use as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just have to use one technique
for your project.
[SPEAKER_00]: At different points of your project,
you might need to use different tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that we can get into the
particular similarities and nuances in the
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we will.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the number one questions I'm asked
is, can you cross a regular male to a
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized C?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got plenty of room to cover those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got lots of cool questions
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, again, when it comes to
setting the tone and we already,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't apologize for this too much,
but we took this kind of really honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: candid approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost kind of like pessimistic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basically just trying to be real with
people and trying to be as clear as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: be to the best of our knowledge on what
you actually are going to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there's any reason to
like be optimistic and skate over what are
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly going to be obstacles for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was the major intent of
this episode and setting the foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: for future conversations about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else that the two of you
would like to add at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Local, anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just do what's fun for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the person making the selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you excited about in selections
you're seeing right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been really pumped about some
of the episodes Appalachia stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's really kind of interesting,
you know, having seen some of these stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: with the Appalachia, you know,
and now that I'm kind of flowering out the
[SPEAKER_03]: good old mountain view, I think it's going
to be really cool to kind of see,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what the difference in selection
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, are there going to be similar
smell profiles?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because to me right now,
like what I'm smelling in this you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the good old Mountain Dew is not what
I've smelled like in the Silver Mountain
[SPEAKER_03]: Haze or the Yo Mama or any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really different range of smell
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's kind of cool to like
slowly like kind of pick away at these
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, comparisons that,
you know, are they're not like apple to
[SPEAKER_03]: apple, but it's not like apple to orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're seeing different
parallels.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a better way to put it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having seen, you know, some of Pac's
trainwreck stuff in person, like I thought
[SPEAKER_03]: that was really fucking dope because like,
Homie literally brought the entire lineup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he did it not really, but you
know, most of what we had and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: really cool to kind of see how trainwreck
blended with some of these things and kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of also be able to see like that,
hey, you know, this thing so-called
[SPEAKER_03]: dominance is a real thing because I saw
it, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can for sure be dominant over a lot of
things, but also it could blend
[SPEAKER_03]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few things that blended
amazing with, you know, despite its
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that's really one of the
like, you know, takeaways really is you're
[SPEAKER_03]: never really going to know until you see
it or until you make the combination
[SPEAKER_03]: either.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, yeah, dominance,
we know it in theory, like we know it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, but to be able to see it,
you know, it's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you mentioned some of the
Homie's projects because, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I think in the subsequent episodes,
it's a perfect time to dig deeper into
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those stories because I think
they're so rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every project is so rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with learning that we could share
with other people.
So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have anything else to add
other than, you know, like check out our
[SPEAKER_01]: Discord Patreon if you want to do research
with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all there interacting a lot,
like even in the audio chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we live, eat,
sleep, breathe, drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a true passion for most of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we talk about it here a lot,
like nerd out, but like this is all some
[SPEAKER_01]: of us do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to add here too that like at the
moment, these episodes are kind of being
[SPEAKER_00]: co-written in a way by our community
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually like building this
alongside what everyone else is talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their input is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been doing this a long time,
like trying to educate with what little I
[SPEAKER_01]: know, but a lot with what other people
have taught me, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has helped a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned a lot from them and
they're helping me figure out what I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't covered in the past and maybe
things that like I wouldn't have even
[SPEAKER_01]: taken into account because I'm so busy
like with my head in a specific part of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding that I haven't even touched on a
lot of the stuff that I should have
[SPEAKER_01]: touched on earlier, like bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has been amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will get, we'll definitely get a
chance to get to those points,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, in the future as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, again, like if you're not
part of the Syndicate, do join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always like jump in and contribute
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are part of the Syndicate,
don't stop sending us your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually getting to the point now
where I can't promise that I've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: seen every single question because that's
how much volume we're getting now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really, really cool to see,
but I try my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's me, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are missing one thing though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is... There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone for showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being here in Thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, as always, for keeping me on
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: 88 keep bouncing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no worries, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone for chiming in,
chiming in, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we'll see you next week on
Greeter's League.
