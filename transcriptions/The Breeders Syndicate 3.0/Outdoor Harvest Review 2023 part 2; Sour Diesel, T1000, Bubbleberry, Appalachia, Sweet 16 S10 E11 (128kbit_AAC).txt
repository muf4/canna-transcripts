[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're here this week with part two of
our outdoor extravaganza, talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the new strains that were
harvested this year with peaches,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cush of the Giants, Little Hill,
and of course, Thousandfold is the host.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be here this week again,
but I'm back the next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did want to tell you about was
that we're having a contest right now for
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting 10K subs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check out the contest video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be up when this hits, and you'll be
able to see all the deets on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lasts about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available for the Instagram account,
breeders.syndicate.podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our other one got deleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not happy about it, so we had to make a
new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, if you're a follower
there, you're going to be entered into a
[SPEAKER_01]: contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we'll announce it on the show
on, I believe, April 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have a separate contest
for the Patreon members as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the details will be in that video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For now, let's start the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one more strain I wanted to talk
about that kind of caught my attention
[SPEAKER_04]: from last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was something I got from my buddy
from Anunaki Genetics up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent me something called, Isn't She
Lovely?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a purple pineapple express to a
Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the first time I had seen a
heavy purple plant that smelled like pee.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear pining.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I smelled pining and gotten really nice
pine smells out of a lot of strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: but never a dark purple strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's hints of like a little
carfenolene or a little pepper in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's mostly dominated by pining.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's another one that struck me
as interesting and struck other people
[SPEAKER_04]: when I'm sharing or when I'm cracking
jars, somebody will grab the jar and
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll be surprised just as much as I am
to get that kind of smell out of purple
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was another one of the highlights of
last year's Grow For Me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever been to a party or a contest
or maybe just a group of friends together
[SPEAKER_05]: that they all bring their jars and you
look, everybody's opening and smelling and
[SPEAKER_05]: you look over the course of the night or
the day or whatever and seeing like
[SPEAKER_05]: certain jars will just be ransacked and
other ones are still sitting there full.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys ever noticed that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a table test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you're not really watching,
but like that, like it tells you what
[SPEAKER_05]: other people are liking.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happened at the party last
year is there were lots of jars that were
[SPEAKER_04]: emptied quickly and there were lots of
jars that were still plumb full left on
[SPEAKER_04]: the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always fun to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of tells the story itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It talks for itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an unofficial little judgment
and it's like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a poll, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like everyone's voting basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking about it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: To make it as objective as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: People shouldn't see how much is left in
each jar because that might in and of
[SPEAKER_02]: itself encourage more people to like take
from the same jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like the jars should like be
open.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be opaque with something for
it to be like a good test because
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise people are just going to notice
which jars are already empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that covers it mostly for
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we could also cover a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Peaches want to have a second round of
highlights?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the only, I would say the other
one that I really enjoyed in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: this year was Riot's Bubble Berry B2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some blueberry turps and a few
of them that were just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the best growing ones as
far as structure wise the way it grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't hardly need any kind of staking
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really happy with that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be consistently one of the
easiest, you know, best growing things
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like everyone says that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw that too myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got a pack of the Bubble Berry
that I'm waiting to go for next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to do it this year, but I decided
to do the Blue Garrick and the Kush
[SPEAKER_04]: Bonnet, whatever, the Blue Resin Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just some armchair breeder
theorizing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder if it's like one step away
from becoming something like quite amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of like, it's got such a strong
base, I feel like, or it is such a good
[SPEAKER_02]: base for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's perfectly great as it
is, but I wonder if something could kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like take it, take it a little bit
further.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know what that might be.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is specifically the Bubble Berry B2
you're referencing?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bubble Berry, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to cross it with the Barber Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd like to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you hoping to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went up and I washed what, 3.6 pounds of
Bubble Berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, she's not a washer,
at least not the Finos I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a feeling that in her is some
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think if it gets crossed,
you know, because the Barber Bud is
[SPEAKER_00]: Shishkeberry by Afghani1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think if we took that,
the Bubble Berry B2 and put them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could get some really good
crosses and then increase the potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: her washing a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that does a pretty good job of
just going over what we grew last year and
[SPEAKER_04]: what we were really elated with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the next little segment,
I think it would be fun to talk about,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this doesn't have to be a long
segment.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of juice to squeeze out
of here, but just talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: post-season cleanup, preparations for next
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys do everything after fall and
it's all prepped for when spring comes
[SPEAKER_04]: around or do you let the winter happen and
then prep in spring?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what kind of entails prepping for your
following season?
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be the next little topic that we
go over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little Hill, you want to start us off here
and tell us what your post-season
[SPEAKER_04]: operations is like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do the least amount possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm usually pretty burnt out and ready to
call it a season by the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I planted a cover crop in
September while there were still plants in
[SPEAKER_05]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still hasn't really taken yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always had issues with cover crops
there, and they've always been very hard
[SPEAKER_05]: to get going before winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll reseed again this spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And see what I can get going.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cover crop was a mix of everything,
clover, lagoons, grasses, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I don't know what's really
going to perform for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've tried this over the years so much
and the weeds seem to do fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those will get tilled back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But besides cover cropping, I roll up my
trellises to reuse the trellis netting
[SPEAKER_05]: because my beds are long and linear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually glad that works out well
because I can use that trellis for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that stuff's expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as like, yeah, not much else in
the order of cleanup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides like disconnecting irrigation and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My stems are still in the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no sense in wrestling them out at
the end of the season because if you'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just let them rot, they will pull out with
no effort in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I let them do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you leave most of that root ball
in the soil, which is good to break down
[SPEAKER_05]: in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're really just pulling out the
stem, which makes life a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can spend days pulling out root balls
and there's just no point.
[SPEAKER_05]: They come out so easy after they rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't have to remove all trace of
evidence of a grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have to do that, that's
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I definitely like letting them rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, one other thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the greenhouses, I have to take my
skins off in the winter because they'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just collapse under snow load.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather than taking them off and pulling
them back on, which is such a task,
[SPEAKER_05]: we just roll them up to the center of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they have roll-up sides anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just keep rolling them all the way
up to the very peak of the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_05]: then tie them off up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's not enough room for snow to
really collect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that makes putting them on in the
spring a heck of a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to untie and let gravity do
the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so much nicer than wrestling with
those things in the spring and the wind
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're big greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're 108 feet long, some of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a task.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my end of season breakdown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the end of the season, and I'm in trim
jail, I'm not too worried about cleaning
[SPEAKER_04]: up everything down there at the end of the
plot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said, there are years where at
the end of the year, I tried uprooting
[SPEAKER_04]: everything and trying to knock that dirt
out of those root balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just sitting there and just beating the
hell out of it, trying to get all the dirt
[SPEAKER_04]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's no fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: After a couple of seasons of that,
I wait until the winter's over,
[SPEAKER_04]: wait till that snow's gone, wait for that
defrost to come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I start working my pots and
pulling that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, I had a little bit of a scare
as my pots were frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up into March, I still had my pots that
were just sitting outside, frozen solid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to get my shovel into them
and not getting anywhere because the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: was frozen solid in those pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we had a winter last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, it was some heavy late winter,
heavy late winters last year, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some moments there where I was
wondering if I'm going to be able to get
[SPEAKER_04]: out on June 1st, wondering about the late
night temps that I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it depends, varies from year to
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some years where I'll go down
there and I'll cut stocks and I'll make
[SPEAKER_04]: walking sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I'll use the bigger stocks on the
bigger plants for some sort of art or
[SPEAKER_04]: craft or some sort of hanging bar that'll
go up in one of the sheds or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, yeah, once harvest is
done, I leave most of that stuff down
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that work gets done before
the spring season, before I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: about transplanting plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about you, Peaches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's been a couple years where I
haven't been able to pull off getting
[SPEAKER_00]: anything done after harvest because things
have been too much and too crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, I actually managed to do
everything I wanted, which was I went back
[SPEAKER_00]: through and turned all the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added compost and biochar and then
planted a winter cover crop that has like
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 different things in it and started
watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got them to sprout and they're now
all full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I don't get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to pull down all the bamboo,
pick up all the twine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use hemp twine to go between the bamboo
for all our trellising and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we take all that down and make sure
there's nothing left up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: no trash, no twine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put all the bamboo away and then let it go
till springtime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it seems to be a pretty concise
agreement amongst a lot of outdoor guys is
[SPEAKER_04]: by the end of that season, we're hands are
full and we're pretty exhausted.
[SPEAKER_04]: From doing stuff since Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of speaking of a heavy winter
last year, I had something happen to me
[SPEAKER_04]: for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this little valley, I so for my
water source, I'm about where I actually
[SPEAKER_04]: grow my outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm about 200, 225 yards away from a
creek, a natural creek inlet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I have one hundred and twenty I
think hundred and twenty gallon tote that
[SPEAKER_04]: I fill with the creek water and then
spigot and tap off of that just to hand
[SPEAKER_04]: water my plants with a with a normal hose
off of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I use a little a little pump to pump
creek water that two hundred and twenty
[SPEAKER_04]: five feet over to my tote.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and for the past 11 or 12 years now in
this specific spot, I've always left my
[SPEAKER_04]: pump outdoors and I've never drained it
and never had an issue with the with the
[SPEAKER_04]: water freezing inside and destroying the
pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, last year, our winter was bad enough
that it it split the bell housing,
[SPEAKER_04]: the pump housing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It literally basically cracked the thing
straight in half.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, whoa, that's the first
time I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it got pretty cold down in that
valley last year for it to to finally
[SPEAKER_04]: freeze the water in that pump and cause it
to expand like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first encounter I've had with a
pump freezing over like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I still I still break metal if you
let it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like it did it pretty easily,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't look like it had that hard of a
time doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I definitely had a lot of damage
over winter, mostly fences.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've definitely had some pipes break,
not metal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was it was a bad winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_05]: This winter doesn't seem as bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a big storm coming right now,
but it looks most it looks like mostly
[SPEAKER_05]: rain with snow on the back end,
but not much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully that holds up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for postseason cleanup, I think that
pretty much covers that topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, we all we all kind of do
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do what we can when we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to to round off this discussion and
finish the last little portion,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's just talk about what we're excited
about for the following year or for the
[SPEAKER_04]: upcoming year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this could include strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: This could include new new additions to
the farm, new plans you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: new equipment that you plan on using just
anything for this following up for this
[SPEAKER_04]: coming up year that you're excited to grow
or excited to use in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peaches, let's let's start with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's what's what's got you excited for
this upcoming year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I actually have my Barb that I'm
going to get to put out as clones and my
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper, Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about that, because usually
we do everything from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm looking forward to not having
to, you know, kick out males and know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, that's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also have some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were calling it Barbarella.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a Barbara Bud crossed with Renee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently they renamed it Sweet Peach
because it is supposed to be peachier than
[SPEAKER_00]: the Barbara Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happened when I bought the Barbara
Bud to get a free pack of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really, really excited about that
one, because I'm hoping for even more
[SPEAKER_00]: peach turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, but are you mad that they called it
Sweet Peach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I mean, everybody's like there's
now a sour peach.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been nice because I would
have probably planned on naming my Fino
[SPEAKER_00]: and something I make that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just happy to find peach turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's what I'm just really
looking forward to that Barbarella.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like I said, having some clones
already to go and not having to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole seed thing this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of looking forward to that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always nice to have something you're
excited for and especially you're looking
[SPEAKER_04]: forward to grow for the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a little different because
normally I mean, I'm excited, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure what we're going to get and have
because we, you know, choose seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been searching through this and
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this year, the main focus is going
to be on just a couple of strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've already grown and we know what to
expect from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been something that's kind of
addictive for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more that I pop the wider spectrum of
these seeds and go further into these
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics is not knowing what you're going
to get is as equal or almost more exciting
[SPEAKER_04]: to me than like a known cut that I know is
going to perform well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they hold the same equal value in my
brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They both scratch the same itch,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about you, Hill?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you super excited about growing
for next year?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited about growing less strains,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew such a variety this year just to
see what was going to work for me in my
[SPEAKER_05]: expansion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to having that
narrowed down to four main strains in the
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoor, the Phoenix, Papaya Bomb,
Mochi Run, and Ice Cream Cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the depths, it's going to be a
whole lot of Ice Cream Cake and a little
[SPEAKER_05]: Mochi Runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a couple other greenhouses will
have long finishers like Sour Diesel and
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there might be some cat piss in there
as well on the early light depth because
[SPEAKER_05]: it does well in the cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, my little side seed
garden where I get to like grow some stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: and hunt through some stuff that I like
either for personal or just to maybe work
[SPEAKER_05]: some breeding projects and just be a hobby
grower in a little small space.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a collection of maybe six Poodle
Nuts crosses that I'm going to grow out
[SPEAKER_05]: along with clones from those two S1s I
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited to look through those.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty wide variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got Bubba Kush to Poodle Nuts from
Caleb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are old seed that he used to give
away as freebies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, that sounds great, though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba Kush was the first thing he reversed
to start his seed company.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's from that lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going back quite some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows how many will germinate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask, just quickly, the Urkel itself,
is it quite a slow creature?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, big time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba does a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also a very squat, very slow, lots of
nodes, short internal length, just like
[SPEAKER_05]: just like Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bubba still grows faster than Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Urkel is just one of the slowest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you flip it, it doesn't
stretch that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you really got to get the veget to
size.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So most Urkel phenotypes, like the Poodle
Nuts, is an Urkel phenotype of its cross,
[SPEAKER_05]: just like T1000's Urkel phenotype of its
cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're definitely on the shorter end of
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: What other crosses?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I got one from Matt, which is one of
his blueberry crosses crossed to Poodle
[SPEAKER_05]: Nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Bluebonnet crossed to Poodle Nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a Poodle Nuts back cross from High
and Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got Poodle Nuts to Kim91 from Goat
and Monkey Seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've also got some Poodle Nuts to
Triangle Kush from Goat and Monkey.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bet I'm forgetting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you like Poodle Nuts?
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it crosses the smells.
[SPEAKER_05]: The smells really translate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're dominant in the crosses,
which has always been surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it crosses well to Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, that's why I want to get
Poodle Nuts back, so I can cross it to
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour Diesel and grow those out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I can't get the cut back,
I'm growing out these other varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to see what's what.
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly do some crosses, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you did say this earlier,
but one thing is Poodle Nuts Urkel to
[SPEAKER_02]: KimD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, remind me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not KimD, but it's a KimD 3BX.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of KimD.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Trace Dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Trace Dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, JJ did a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then High and Lonesome made the cross
to Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is very much KimD cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to grow out a bunch of
old Heart Attack Kush seeds, looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: some early finishing plants that I know
are in that genetic line, which is Kush
[SPEAKER_05]: Cleaner to SFV or SFV to Kush Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are some F2s I made from that
cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully going to find some early
finishers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely on the Turpinoline
scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've kind of like steered clear of
too much Turpinoline in my garden over the
[SPEAKER_05]: years, just because buyers kind of thumb
their noses at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like it's a turp, because it's
so dominant in everything it's crossed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very easy for everything to end up
smelling like Jack, Jackarare,
[SPEAKER_05]: or Turpinoline, or Jack Terps,
as people call it, or pine, or whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the next generation hasn't
been exposed to it like we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as long as it checks all the other
boxes, and for me, it needs to be early,
[SPEAKER_05]: because I want something to finish early
and to get my outdoor harvest started
[SPEAKER_05]: early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it seems to me to function really
well as a counterpoint to something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get it to work with something
else, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like alongside another nice turp.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, it just overpowers everything it's
crossed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might find something that has a
little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, you're just going
to get hit in the face with a pine tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe this is why the Santa Cruz
Ricks are interesting to me, because it
[SPEAKER_02]: does seem like there's an actual shot of
getting like a blueberry Turpinoline,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a decent balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's the case, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe you got lucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the high, like having Turpinoline in
there, I think is good, regardless,
[SPEAKER_05]: just because I think it adds to a more
euphoric sort of energetic high,
[SPEAKER_05]: which, you know, most of us are looking
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy to find the lethargic high.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you can find that high that makes
you clean your house and get motivated to
[SPEAKER_05]: do stuff, that's always a fun tool in the
toolbox, you know, for certain occasions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always found that in the
Turpinoline strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, typically they're more narrow
leaf cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Haze has a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Durban poison has a lot of it.
Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the super silver hazes that have
gone around have been Turpinoline
[SPEAKER_05]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, all those Colombian Panama
tie, they all have that in there big time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know what kind of high those things
have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll like having it in my garden as
long as it sells.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it will or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me having an earlier finisher,
and this is just a genetic line I happen
[SPEAKER_05]: to have in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's there because I've grown a
lot of it over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of like, hey, let's bring
back some old stuff and see how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it doesn't, you know,
but like I've got a little bit of space
[SPEAKER_05]: where I can experiment and do things like
that just in hopes of finding something
[SPEAKER_05]: new that really works for me as a grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's yeah, that's about that's about
what I have cooking for next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet, sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super interested to see, especially
with Bubba kind of making a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: that resurgence and, you know,
CSI starting to starting to do a little
[SPEAKER_04]: more work with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see how more prevalent if
it's cyclical and starts coming back
[SPEAKER_04]: around more because Bubba was one of the
first ones that really stood out to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my younger and earlier days of
smoking, it was the first one that really
[SPEAKER_04]: floored me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was me, thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was thousand.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubba Kush was one of the first ones that
really floored you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with CSI's upcoming work, I'm kind of
curious to see if we see a resurgence in
[SPEAKER_04]: the community where a lot more people are
playing around with it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make me really happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that's one of the things that
I'm personally that I'm excited for to try
[SPEAKER_04]: next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I plan on looking through CSI's catalog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's two things that that I want to
pick up to try for next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them would be I want to try the
Humboldt uppercut by itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe, Hill, you were saying that you
guys also got cantaloupe or like sweet
[SPEAKER_04]: honeydew melon out of the Humboldt
uppercut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That you were growing and the sweet 16
Humboldt uppercut that I grew was a dead
[SPEAKER_04]: ringer for cantaloupe, like smelling the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't believe how closely related to
cantaloupe it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that just made me want to want to go
back to the root of the Humboldt uppercut
[SPEAKER_04]: and pop some of those and see what's
hanging out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little Hill that was talking about the
Humboldt uppercut.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I didn't grow that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember who I was talking to,
but they did a friend and a family member
[SPEAKER_04]: who also grew them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were mentioning cantaloupe terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just I liked that line through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it made me want to go back to the to
the original to see where it's coming from
[SPEAKER_04]: that and also buying some of the some of
the new Bubba Kush stuff that that he's
[SPEAKER_04]: got out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll probably be running some Humboldt
uppercut and some Bubba Kush stuff for for
[SPEAKER_04]: next year's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the sweet 16 hybrids that I was
given but didn't get a chance to pop was
[SPEAKER_04]: the bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious to see if the sweet 16
bubblegum cross keeps its you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it comes across with bubblegum turps,
but still has the potency and the the
[SPEAKER_04]: pungent, you know, fermenting smells that
come from the sweet 16, it could really
[SPEAKER_04]: bolster those bubblegum turps that seem to
fall off in every bubblegum strain that
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had anything that smells like
bubblegum in flower and then I harvest it,
[SPEAKER_04]: get it in jars and the bubblegum transfers
over it almost always dissipates.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds exciting that that cross just
because bubblegum bubblegum does so well
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoors and has good finishing times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's such a sweet frosty bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, if you if it could do something
to help it retain that smell and flavor,
[SPEAKER_05]: that that would be that would be
absolutely killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been it's been a great hybrid for
outdoor growers as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything crossed a bubblegum has been has
done well for people and same with Bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't grown the Bubba the bubblegum
crosses but I've grown a lot of Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses outdoors like full term back back
when we were growing big plants and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: super surprised not being a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so surprised how big these plants
got.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still had those big broad leafs that
Bubba Kush has.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were fucking enormous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of them were OG crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got absolutely huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is surprising to me for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they loved the NorCal Sun and some
of the biggest outdoor plants I've ever
[SPEAKER_05]: had.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the biggest plants outdoor plants I've
ever had are been from seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these were especially just girthy
because of the size of their leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thickness of their stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: I even had a huge windstorm where the top
of the plant actually blew off the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like the top maybe two and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that top cola they weren't topped or
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it looked like a grenade went
off in the plant and there were trellis
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that that stem just blew straight off
the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was in September and it was it
was a loss on that part that blew off.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, like a grenade went off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have thought that a Bubba type
would be quite mold prone as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you would think that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big, thick indica buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: I typically didn't have mold issues back
in the day growing big outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was selecting strains that wouldn't mold
on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like stuff that molds on other people
didn't mold on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't I didn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: CSI might say different where he was
because I know he always had more mold
[SPEAKER_05]: problems than I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's just part of the vigor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like the buds were dense and like all
the all the parameters were there for bad
[SPEAKER_05]: mold.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I just never had that issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has anyone done a bubblegum Bubba cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's one of the reasons that has me
so interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not it's a keystone factor into why
I'm curious about trying the sweet 16
[SPEAKER_04]: bubblegum is its notorious mold resistance
and bud rot resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: You I don't have any fears of running that
sweet 16 bubblegum outdoors as long as it
[SPEAKER_04]: can go full term.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two other examples of the bubblegum
cut that CSI used that I grew in my
[SPEAKER_04]: garden, they were grown outdoors,
endured multiple rainstorms that were over
[SPEAKER_04]: an inch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even the the Albert Walker bubblegum
survived ice like there were there was
[SPEAKER_04]: snow that landed on it and then froze.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like actual I had like thump
the nugs to get ice sheets of ice to fall
[SPEAKER_04]: off the buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was not a trace of mildew,
not a trace of mold, not a trace of bud
[SPEAKER_04]: rot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really impressed with the impervious
qualities to mold that his bubblegum cut
[SPEAKER_04]: had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that Albert Walker bubblegum plant
that I had, it had every chance to create
[SPEAKER_04]: mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had it had exposed branches,
exposed stems and branches that were
[SPEAKER_04]: rubbed and had had dead cell material on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had decaying fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was all and it had plenty of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the the right qualifiers to create
a molding mess were there and it just
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I'm really curious to see what
the sweet 16 bubblegum does next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might end up doing probably two,
maybe three plants or I could go with the
[SPEAKER_04]: the method that I did with the sweet 16
Kim D's and grow three of them in one pot
[SPEAKER_04]: and kind of let them vie for control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And fight for each other for some five,
six foot tall plants instead of some 10
[SPEAKER_04]: foot tall monsters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so next year I'm I'm excited about
the Bubba Kush stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited about more sweet 16 stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to I'm going to go back and I'm
going to run some more Appalachia stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this time I'm probably going to run
the Appalachia F3s just to get a sense of
[SPEAKER_04]: the green crack and the Tress dog mixed
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm really liking those now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked everything that I saw out of the
Appalachia hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly the outdoor vigor literally just
growing giant butterball bushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to go back to the core
Appalachia and see what's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably run the Loomis headband Appy
because I was so impressed with the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: that my brother grew last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also super excited to jump back on the
Humboldt's Most Wanted, which I grew two
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago, didn't grow last year,
and I'm jonesing for it this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of my favorite plants grew
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Girl Scout hybrid from CSI that is
just does its own thing and provides
[SPEAKER_04]: really great smoke for me in my perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It perfectly works for my climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else am I excited for next year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rec mixing the Blue Dream with the ATWs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably run category five again
because I liked it a little more than the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mojo Rising and my brother liked the Mojo
Rising more than the cat five.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll probably run a couple cat fives.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely am interested in trying to
get the blooper skunk up and running the
[SPEAKER_04]: G-Soul blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had two of them last year, but both of
them turned out being males.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were really big, healthy,
bushy plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was looking at them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, man, these end up being
female.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are going to be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But alas, both of them were were males.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Blueberry Nine, the Riot Berry,
the Blue Garreg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all riot stuff that really
intrigued me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so on top of trying some more
riot gear, some more goat farm gear,
[SPEAKER_04]: some more CSI gear, I'm also going to
return back to some of the stuff that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: created in 2021.
[SPEAKER_04]: I created a series of pine tar kush
hybrids and I played around with them here
[SPEAKER_04]: and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But friends and close relatives have grown
them more than I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen some really, really good
success in the Living Dead Girl pine tar
[SPEAKER_04]: kush crosses and the the Lemon Party pine
tar kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: So next year, this coming year,
I'm going to be playing around with some
[SPEAKER_04]: of my own seeds a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get back into the the KOTGF
ones, the black cherry soda hybrids that I
[SPEAKER_04]: crossed to the Sour Diesel White Widows in
2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew a handful of those and I was just
really happy with everything that came out
[SPEAKER_04]: of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just haven't revisited it yet
because I've been so happy exploring this
[SPEAKER_04]: plethora of genetics that I've been
thankfully given access to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll do a little little return to
Cinder and come back home and pop some of
[SPEAKER_04]: my own stuff and, you know, get back into
my own my own genetics, which I'm also
[SPEAKER_04]: just as excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did think of one prompt I had or a
question I had for for Peaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if she wants to speak to it,
though, but I wondered if you might tell
[SPEAKER_02]: us a bit about the early Pearl stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's kind of like more on Buck's
side of the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we even have maybe talked about doing
a whole episode on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder if you give us like a little,
you know, update on on that, on what the
[SPEAKER_02]: story is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the early Pearl has been his
definite he's been on the search for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year is White Whale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has been ever since ever since
I've met him, actually, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we met at 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, man, we had the early Pearl
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the Silver Pearl S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Pips Perfect Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the Lost Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also had the Hunza Valley 91 by
early Pearl that we and made the year
[SPEAKER_00]: before because, you know, he's searching
for that that one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, actually, he tracked down
some 20 year old early Pearl clone strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the one that's going
to go out on the hill, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really excited about that one because
he said from what he talked to the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: about it has the smell and the looks of
what he's been searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: For.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's gotten to the point
like we've done this so much last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him he couldn't have any of the
plots on the hill for early Pearl that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing my peach hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is like I don't even know 20 some
plants down here in one gallon pots that
[SPEAKER_00]: he was searching through last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found one male that we kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the room back there that we're
going to use for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know, it's just he's still on
that search.
[SPEAKER_00]: We quite haven't found the one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that covered what
you're asking about or if there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the fact that like he has
structured such a strong, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: affiliation with that particular plant in
his mind and, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Searching for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like, you know, it's kind of an
epic story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real epic story because that you
know, he's the short little story is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when he he lost his dad when he
was young and then this guy who mentored
[SPEAKER_00]: him was really like a father figure to him
and probably one of the only men in his
[SPEAKER_00]: life that was actually like a decent man
to him and wasn't, you know, an ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed Cass, you know, all about
this growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, Cass had been growing before,
but when he went there, this guy was his
[SPEAKER_00]: mentor and he was a good person and as
well as a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the early pro was the strain
that he went and helped him with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, his wife had cancer at the time,
and that's why he went over there to help
[SPEAKER_00]: him grow so he could be, you know,
taking care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took her to chemo and did that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that strain was what him and his
his his name was Stan Harding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his whole thing about this is trying
to get his story told because he was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those old guys who, you know,
ended up going to jail and he they let him
[SPEAKER_00]: out to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, and it's just one of those
stories of, you know, so many of us have
[SPEAKER_00]: of our uncles or grandpas that the you
know, the war on drugs took people from us
[SPEAKER_00]: that should have never been taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that strain means a lot to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we've done a lot to try to
bring it back and try to find,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that exact one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been really hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: These stories like that are like keystone
like moments for a lot of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's some of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my favorite stuff in the community
is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people who have been chasing this
strain for X amount of years or they're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to get back to it because it meant
so much to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's really cool to see people in the
community that have that gumption to chase
[SPEAKER_04]: after something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's taken,
you know, well, you guys know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've probably gone through, I don't know,
20 plus seed packs over the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to find that one and we still
haven't found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're switching to the trying to,
you know, breed with it and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: got the mail and try to, you know,
bring it back and bring some vigor back to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, you know, feels like it's really kind
of lost what it had back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a whole really neat
story to it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to tell it all right now
because I know he wants to do an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it did that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we will hopefully have an actual
show on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe actually it's like a maybe it'll be
a good time to do it like either before
[SPEAKER_02]: the next season starts or a part way
through or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, yeah, I think I think
that wraps up most of what we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that we could we could talk a
little bit about the future of the outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: roundtable and where it's going to go for
2024.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, tell us about your ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mostly my idea is basically a framework
replica of what we did last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to check in every month or
every couple of months about what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything's new, updating with our
outdoor grows, but also sprinkled in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start to try and do some
interviews over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through Instagram, through ICMAG forums,
through people I've met in the valley all
[SPEAKER_04]: over Northern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I plan on doing interviews with these
select people and just sitting down and
[SPEAKER_04]: having a one to one conversation and
getting to know some of these outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much like myself, a lot of us are recluse
and we don't we wouldn't without being
[SPEAKER_04]: prodded or poked, we wouldn't have jumped
into the community and started talking and
[SPEAKER_04]: and making ourselves more known.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know tons of cats like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got five or six guys off the top of my
head and women, both guys and girls that I
[SPEAKER_04]: want to interview and I want to have
discussions with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all they're all great outdoor
growers and great minds for what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing in their own respective rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that more and more people
should have discussions with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these people I've spent a lot of
time sending paragraphs back and forth
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about weed and talking about life,
but haven't sat down and done a an actual
[SPEAKER_04]: voice conversation like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I think I think people need to
need to be exposed to the different shades
[SPEAKER_04]: of growers that we have out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost no two outdoor growers are alike.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's a very unique community that
I've ran into so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm excited to talk to them and
sprinkle in some of those interviews
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the year on top of just the
normal outdoor roundtable stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, sounds great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we already have quite a good
foundation to build on and very,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, very appreciative of your
efforts, Christian, but also, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Peters and Little Hill for helping us out
so much over the last six months or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate you guys coming and providing
your your thoughts and your insight and
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting down and chatting with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the invite and getting
to sit and chat with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm happy to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love talking about weed, so it works out
well for me and hearing other people's
[SPEAKER_05]: experiences with some of these strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get a chance to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm happy to chat as the season
moves forward to to talk about what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on and what issues are arising and
and kind of the season's a marathon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's funny to check.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's fun to check in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how everybody's doing and how they're
dealing with with different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right on, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to me, that is a really nice thing
about outdoor, at least, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: living in a similar region anyway,
where you guys are actually in pace with
[SPEAKER_02]: each other sort of and kind of check in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, you know, if you're an indoor
grower, like it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have right kind of seasonal
progression, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's there's a couple major
keystones like, you know, going outdoors
[SPEAKER_04]: when everybody and then when it flips into
flower, we're all not on the exact same
[SPEAKER_04]: schedule, but we're all tuned into the
same, you know, we're right on par with
[SPEAKER_04]: each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never thought about it that way compared
to to indoor, you know, guys who are
[SPEAKER_04]: modulating their own schedules.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a set of rituals or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I feel like my outdoor garden,
the more I do it, it turns into a ritual.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's become a meditative process for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's like unconscious
meditation, just going down, hanging out
[SPEAKER_04]: with the plants, you know, cutting a few
families here and there, talking to the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it for so long now that it's
it's basically a part of my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's it's like like, you know,
meditation to me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your second nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think I can probably wrap us up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do the shout outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any shout outs from you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys can hit me up on Instagram,
Little Hill Cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still selling farm swag, all organic
cotton, American made farm swag.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to represent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty low key way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing that says cannabis on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to actually get some Breeder
Syndicate swag to wear because I like the
[SPEAKER_05]: design and want to sort of low key support
the support the channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I need to get Matt to get on the
snapbacks, get some hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on with
the Riot merch at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going, but not not 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any shout outs from Peaches Wilkush at
this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, just, you know, come to the
Discord and ask questions, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: come talk to me about edibles and hash and
answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, same same mirrored sentiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a shout out to the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be here if you guys didn't want
me here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm open for questions and,
you know, so feel free to hit me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Discord, Instagram, shoot me a message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always open to talk about plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say as well, going back to
an earlier point you made, Kersh,
[SPEAKER_02]: about seeing who you could get on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If between you and Little Hill,
you can actually get Caleb on again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys would deserve a medal,
get a trophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get Denali on again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get in his ear for sure, because I
always those are my favorite episodes when
[SPEAKER_05]: he's talking or a couple of other folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, he talks to Matt quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matt says that, you know, he tries to
be like, polite because he's a friend and
[SPEAKER_02]: he doesn't want to pressure him too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, why don't you just pressure
him?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll pressure him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll just say no, but I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denali's definitely planned for a return.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caleb, I'm not, we'll have to do some
sweet talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe across you two and Matt,
maybe we'll get somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll wrangle them in.
Okay.

Matt normally does.
