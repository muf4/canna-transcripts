[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-Dot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so tonight I was thinking about
maybe we could talk about breeding A to Z,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the form of like maybe I'll give
you a set of traits that I want out of an
[SPEAKER_01]: end goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just teaching people to start using
goals in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you traits for an end goal,
hypothetical end goal, and you build it in
[SPEAKER_01]: your hypothetical toolbox, what have you,
and you talk about the ways you would go
[SPEAKER_01]: about this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then vice versa, you can give me some
surprise traits and then I'll do that with
[SPEAKER_01]: a feminized version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you give me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like you're underwater today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the deal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it coming clear for everyone or just
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we could ask who's fucking on
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys hear him super clear or is he
muffled?
[SPEAKER_00]: How we sound in... Testing, testing,
one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't use the cool microphone and shit
this round because I thought it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: not doing anything different, but maybe
that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just me, so I'll suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You suffer through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll suffer through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's like one of the... Maybe
I'll throw like my spiel on it or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, but for a minute there,
probably the last five to seven years
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, there was like this explosion
of seed making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked amongst about it's
probably like maybe even to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where like 90% of the current people
selling seeds started in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that time, there was this big
explosion of monetary value and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that economics changed how people
bred a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone, but certainly a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what used to be like side
projects that could take some time or have
[SPEAKER_00]: goals ended up being like mashing a lot of
famous things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that there's anything wrong with that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just changed the dynamic of like a
lot of multi-stage breeding kind of went
[SPEAKER_00]: like to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sure did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're talking about this
evening is sort of like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you can get lucky and just knock
it out of the park one step, but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part, like it would be a multi-stage
process to get to where you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, over several years, over several,
several years, it's really hard to knock
[SPEAKER_01]: it out of the park consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time, unless you're doing certain
kinds of FEM breeding of known clone to
[SPEAKER_01]: known clone, you know, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so, you know, one of the
benefits of like what's happening right
[SPEAKER_00]: now in the community might be that like
the people that do decide to keep breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: people are into like longer projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so it used to be there was a
minute there where people would be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you can't get Skittles and you can't
get Chem 91, but if I make a hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you'll buy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so rather than like Skittles has these
things that I want and so does Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a way I can blend these two
things and eventually end up with this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that has the best of both worlds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's still like, if I can blend
these two things, I guess that's still an
[SPEAKER_01]: end goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an end goal of what you think
they might end up at in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's still kind of like the process,
the beginning process of making crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, hey, plant A, plant B,
I want the best of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what happens, you know,
but having an end goal where you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want this plant to end up like this for
this environment for this, this XYZ is
[SPEAKER_01]: super detailed, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it depends on how similar
you want them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you might only care about like,
for instance, a couple of the traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to combine and not need it
to be like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, like the more things you're
trying to achieve, the more difficult it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, you know, a simple way to think
about it would be like, what if I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: combine the turps from this plant with the
potency of this other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're only searching for two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be defined by your goals too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think about it so differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think that like to me that I
don't consider that it's goals,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not what I'm necessarily
referring to when I say goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one, one is I'm predicting,
I want an outcome, desired outcome,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm picking many, I'm picking from my
library to make that outcome happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other is still, I'm going to hit
these together and try to get the best out
[SPEAKER_01]: of what results based on what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying one is more legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like they're,
you know, it's like a little bit different
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to create like a line that has
certain traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm going to ask you to do is
going to be the hard one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, and then on top of
that too, like, you know, it, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, but like if you have
breeders, Matt's one, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that have been at it for a long time
and that keep certain plants around quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our buddy, Caleb or flight or
whoever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What they get to do is the more you breed,
you actually get to start to see which
[SPEAKER_00]: traits of the plant that you breed with
follow up in the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's some really amazing cuts
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That suck is breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the individual cut itself is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great smoke and all that,
but it's not a stable or a solid thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other things that just
seem to breed true for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics almost no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot that are just shit growers
that people normally wouldn't keep,
[SPEAKER_01]: but are amazing breeders and don't breed
for the traits they visually express.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just said, yes, turpentine is
very hard to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once, once it's in there, boy,
it's really difficult finding what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want without it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really dominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If she throws her weight around,
you know, and that's interesting too,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's aspects where it's like,
uh, since I'm going to do the hard one,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, what used to be fucked up
about breeding, especially if it took
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-stage is that you have to make sure
that you save seeds from every stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can totally fuck up a line and
do something that you didn't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have a way to go back one
generation and go in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, then you're just stuck with
that mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I don't think most people,
when they think about breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that they would ever have to go
back a generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that even comes into the
equation in their, in their mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it didn't when I was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it can be, most, I mean,
most of our friends wish they had,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's at least one project they did that
they really liked that they feel like they
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up a bit along the way and they
wish they could go back and redo.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, he feels like DJ did that DJ stuff
is DJ stuff is his own story in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, I mean, there's an
aspect of like different people have
[SPEAKER_00]: worked his stuff in different directions
at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's given it over to seed companies and
then gotten back seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it definitely is like what era you
got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could vary quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say so, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but yeah, I mean,
there's, there's an aspect of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for like most hobby breeders
really having some kind of goal is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably good, you know, cause I tell
people all the time, like the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important thing of what you're doing is
that like, you're happy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, for a long, for a long time
we've bred, we just tried to breed weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that we like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because it was, it was long enough ago
that like, we just never really felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of seed company was, was even
realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought ever about getting a
famous seed company ever in the history of
[SPEAKER_01]: my company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when we were, when we were
breeding in the, in the nineties and early
[SPEAKER_00]: two thousands and stuff like that,
like the people that started seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies back then literally still went
to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to go there to make it,
big, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a massive life shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was, you know, so a lot of us,
we just bred, we just bred for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now it's cool with Instagram,
you know, and all these different various
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms, you can do some, a lot of
people can do small breeding and then
[SPEAKER_00]: offer it up and reach people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this commercialism aspect
that was like hard before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like before a lot of times people were
trying to just please themselves or their
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's more like, please the public,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, there was a certain era too,
where it wasn't even just pleased the
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a much smaller crowd and it was
pleased the forum crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny era of, well, it may not be what I
like, but it's what sells on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even that is a vast difference from
what sells on Instagram now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I remember those,
I remember those errors and what was hot
[SPEAKER_00]: and like the pressure to breed with all
that work because it's just, people want
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I, you know, we, there's even
posts from Neville when he was,
[SPEAKER_00]: when he was posting in like 2009 or 10,
that even in the eighties and early
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties, he would get shit for everybody
would be like, Oh, I want the purest
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica imaginable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd release something that was like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would suffer and yield and
he would get endless bitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always been a commercial aspect
of it, you know, and then you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: having to like, you end up having to
please people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some ways, um, all my friends,
anybody that breeds for non-commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, you just get to do whatever the
fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in this case, you're going to do
what the customer wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a rather picky customer,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's something that obviously has to
work in the modern market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since this is 2022, they want something
with eight weeks flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want none of that long
flowering shit that you love.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want eight weeks flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they want a little bit of purple,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing that they're
missing in their arsenal is black licorice
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed with gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want, they want some gassy backend on
it and black licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, uh, modern market and
they don't want any OG or cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do we start to please this
customer?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want any OG or cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so right there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it every, everybody just heard,
like they want like six different things
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that everything you add make
potentially makes it harder or longer of a
[SPEAKER_00]: search to try to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have to get luckier to find it
quick or you have to have a large library
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that helps too, because
obviously like, if you know how your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants breed, that could narrow it down a
bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for me, but if you were just trying
to smash plants together to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, it would probably be pretty rough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically what they want is
something that's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want quick purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want good Terps frosty frosty is shit
because it has to be shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a modern market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need something that washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need something that washes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no OG either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: No OG either.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to turn that corner like
burner was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want it to be feminized or
regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're doing regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do the same for me in
reverse with feminized and you can pick
[SPEAKER_01]: the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just fucked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the hard part obviously is that,
okay, so just break it down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something frosty, terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, you need it to come in relatively
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, uh, the, the hardest one out of
all that is probably like the black
[SPEAKER_00]: licorice Terps, uh, cause that's pretty
specific and fucking rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the other part of it that
sucks, you know, is that it has to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that, in that regard, what you would
have to do is you would eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be several, it can be a multi-step
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so that's what I'm saying is like,
you would end up, you know, one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: first steps probably would be like,
you would have to figure out what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of male you wanted to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would cross it to,
you know, the, uh, one of the females that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to use and start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a male female blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, cause now at first you need
a pollen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the attractiveness of
fucking, uh, everybody like doing
[SPEAKER_00]: feminizes because they can create their
own pollen source and they knew pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much what traits were going to probably
pass because they could smell their pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: source and look at the bud.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, so there's basically,
there's a way to where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, once you, once you, and that's
where all like the BX or BC is people
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, like that's where it
started is people needed a pollen donor to
[SPEAKER_00]: start working on their line idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they could start playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they had pollen, they could make
pollen every generation is really what it
[SPEAKER_00]: boils down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, realistically speaking,
uh, probably what I would end up doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is that, uh, uh, my buddy is throwing
me off by answering, but what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably do is I would cheat and I would,
uh, my buddy that just made me laugh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, him and I made some, a bunch of
hybrids, um, with some old maple leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: endicase seeds from the early two
thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that they,
we did is we crossed it to the Mendo P.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Mendo P has some color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got crazy turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it doesn't wash that well or anything
like that, but at the very least,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's something old and basic that you
could start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one of the things you need
to start with is like an idea of how
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to start and how you're going
to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because whatever you finish with the cross
is 50% that, you know, and so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting, you're starting and you're
ending is 50 50 and in the middle you get
[SPEAKER_00]: to play.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and it's not potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the thing is you're
starting with limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, we don't need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe potency was a part of it
because in today's market, you can wash it
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything's potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potent is not a part of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably what I would do is I would
take that maple leaf endicure by Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would grow it out and I would pick a
male, probably one that leaned like in
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially one that turned colors on
its male flowers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would probably pick the most Mendo
perp leaning, uh, male I possibly could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which should be relatively easy because
the maple doesn't turn colors and the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: structure is way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and Mendo P kicks certain kinds of
turps, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mendo P kicks certain kinds of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and well, the other two is that it's
like a basic Indica that I started with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you cross it to something
extremely unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can pick out a bunch of
that unique, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your mail, which makes it a lot easier
than if it was like two similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so take some pollen to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would probably throw it on something
like the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have thought of that choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason is, is that when I was
doing that project down South,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I got to run a lot of a lot of
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably ran half a dozen snow
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shit just consistently kicks nice,
pretty colas covered in frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shortens up the, the flower time and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, the Mendo perps would
bring some color and some turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snow would bring structure and crystal
and like a nice look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good, that's a good choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen it, and I've seen it work
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a bunch of hybrids already throw the
kind of traits through a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different crosses that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chance that it could do that in
this one is probably reasonably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So boom, now I have a snow by,
by maple, by purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grow up that now it's more
complicated because you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so now probably what you're doing is
because you're, it's not going to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to visually pick it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably get shitty and you'd
probably end up picking like three of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nicest males you could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And separately pollinating like the female
of your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you grow them all out and you see
which, which of those three, hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: past the most traits that you were looking
for, because there's an aspect with males
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're like really not going to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so the wider male pool you use,
the, uh, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as you can isolate it and see
which one goes to it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the sake of this argument,
not to get like crazy esoteric and stupid,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say three triplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I have a, a snow Mendo P maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so I take a male of that or three
males of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hit it to, I hit it each separately
to my Mali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Maui is in the Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Maui turns purple in the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got chunks all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got a quick maple,
a quick Mendo P a quick Maui, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the snow's reasonably quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden you start upping your
chances that like a Fino that you want is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in that, that 50 to 60 day
range of what you're going for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and since the Maui turns a little
purple and the Mendo P is purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have a lot of purple in there,
but you have some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can start looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the snow and the Maui end up
having like, you know, the structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: the frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I would hunt through that,
but that's, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maple onto them, maple onto them,
under the Mendo P that's one stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that onto the snow, that's two
stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a, a mail out of that onto the
Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already at three stages.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and where's your gas coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's my gas coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, you know, the gas is going to be
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, because I think right there,
you probably have your, your, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait, you said gas and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas and licorice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I just pick one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to pick one and you're
going to have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a, like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's like a four way hybrid now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like maple, maple started the pollen,
maple Mendo and snow and Maui.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wanted, if we wanted,
now it's going to be 50% of the cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a bunch of early shit,
a bunch of frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frosty shit, a couple purple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I really wanted to Jack up the purple
and the licorice, I only have one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put it on the anus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that would be, but then I would
be, that would be fucked because then
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be a chance that you would
also get gas would be kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anus, the anus, the star anus,
you know, because black liquor is really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think to be perfectly honest,
we're not going for gas anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just dropping that going for all
black licorice and modern people are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about Yeager.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the anus is actually extremely close
to the Yeager.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, somebody who said the fishermen,
who the fuck just said the fishermen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my buddy, uh, my buddy and I,
we used to grow a bunch of anus together
[SPEAKER_00]: and he used to take it down to the bay and
give it to certain crews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a professional tuner fishermen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they used to call, they used to call
when we sold them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we, they used to call it the,
the fishermen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my buddy's nickname was actually
tuna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was he in, is he in the movie blow?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he was not in the movie blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he, but yeah, I mean, he's,
he's actually like, uh, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's actually a big part of that story
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, the, uh, the fishermen,
he, uh, um, that was probably back in Oh
[SPEAKER_00]: six or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just so people know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I didn't even talk about like,
you could get really lucky in what I
[SPEAKER_00]: described and you could do it all in,
in that many steps, or you could grow shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out and realize it's not at all what you
want and want to go back a step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a best case scenario right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That definitely is a best case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because that, that's assuming
that like each stage, and then you could
[SPEAKER_00]: talk for a little bit about like,
well, how many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because every cross you have a
female is the certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does the male pass what you want of
the hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I always call it the shotgun
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You called it the shotgun method and it's
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like what they, people used to do in
the old days is they would, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: cross like their three, every stage,
they would cross their three favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the same female and mark them
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you grow them out,
you look and whatever one gave you the
[SPEAKER_00]: best females, you picked males from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That donation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because you were, because that,
that was the way that we tested back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just did one male, you're just
hoping three isn't even all that great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like, let's be reasonable about
people's ability to actually do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then, you know,
it doesn't, I mean, it doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on everybody's size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 50 or a hundred seeds held back
is probably plenty for most people's
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, stick with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd probably, and then you'd
put right there, you'd probably have a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that would be, there would be
plenty of purple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be a lot of frosty and
visually attractive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The licorice would be in there,
but it might be a little harder to find,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the gas, we'd have to do one
more stage to something to get lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they asked what you're naming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's going to probably call it the
obvious, the purple anus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple anus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how, I mean, in a sense,
like, you know, when, when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: planning the super dog project,
it was like, we, we were trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the looks and the greenery and
the smell of the skunk combined with like
[SPEAKER_00]: the density and the, and the power of the
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Matt just gave me was he just
gave me like, what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A five or six requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was several.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it a real paint project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple, black licorice, gas, eight weeks
flowering works in the modern market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's like five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's half a dozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's half a dozen different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it more difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only looking to combine a couple
of traits from, from one cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can do what I'm going to do with
Matt and you can do easy and you can cheat
[SPEAKER_00]: and you not do, don't even need a mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that's how everybody used to
start things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the traditional way, which is
like what got done to maybe like the C 99
[SPEAKER_00]: and other shit was that people would now
it's BC, but back then it was BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would just repeatedly cross males
of a, of a hybrid to the same clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically trying to get an inbred plant
that was as close to the mother clone as
[SPEAKER_00]: they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, that explanation of C
99 and there, and, and that long
[SPEAKER_01]: explanation of how it was achieved and
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have consistently, even myself,
I was trying to do BX threes for years and
[SPEAKER_01]: finding that like, I'm ending up with way
more bullshit than I started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does this look like an F2 as opposed
to a BX three, this should be locking in
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, not going way further away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just doesn't, sometimes things work
great in theory in other plants that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily apply as well in cannabis
because it's so variant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't understand that
because of C 99, the, the misinformation
[SPEAKER_01]: given with C 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, people just think that like,
you know, when you're BX and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd probably need a pretty big
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a reason why they call it
inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really takes big populations
to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most people are doing hobby shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you just, you know,
is, is like, there's an aspect of like
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to, you know, it's like,
I always think of like what Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria was for his NL five hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he didn't want anything that went over
16 weeks because he thought that was way
[SPEAKER_00]: too fucking long and he wanted the potency
and he wanted nice enough buds and enough
[SPEAKER_00]: yield that it was worth going the four
months it took.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had to grow and grow down a grow
Dan Rockwell on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I mean, they, I mean,
that's all they used or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, that was the aspect,
but that's not, he didn't really actually
[SPEAKER_00]: breed for Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't breed he didn't add in a bunch
of extra shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going for weight potency and it
couldn't take 22 weeks, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of the hazes were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he only picked really three
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you know, we just picked
five or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just goes to show that like,
don't, don't get discouraged, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to, try to pick a reasonable,
a reasonable blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always easier if like,
if Matt hadn't given me like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the licorice thing was a super bitch,
but like if, cause it really limits,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only a few things that have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to go cinnamon, but I decided
to be nice cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have just thrown my hands up and
been like, what the fuck, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cause you can get too specific,
but I mean, obviously there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's scents like gas or like turpentine
or like citrus or whatever that occur
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly enough in cannabis that you'd
have a bunch of pads to pick where you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get that turp from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turp that Matt picked was hella
limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really are like grasping at straws.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some, there are some good ones I
thought of that you could have come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have covered all the bases too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might've missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard to think off the top
of your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: A four or five stage project that requires
a real male because you know, 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, all your buddy seeds, it was like
everything you had in your collection had
[SPEAKER_00]: regular males in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now most of my, not all of it,
but there's a good chunk of my shit that's
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say it's useless,
but it's like for this particular fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, it's like not very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people make reg seeds right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you could have done a fem female
with a male fem line females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's probably, and that's the
cool part, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it's like sometimes past your
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what you had access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Chem D L A Kush was one I was
thinking of specifically for like maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: some, some turps like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, gas and black licorice,
but it's not necessarily purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I actually missed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that until a whole bunch
of people started popping that hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the LA by D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there's a bunch of people that
got gas and headband aromas and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was expecting, but I would say
there's been a few dozen people at least
[SPEAKER_00]: that have talked about anus turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the anus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the anus, which was really
interesting, you know, to, to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up, um, you know, even occasionally or
whatever, you know, uh, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, you know, I, I went on a mission a
while, a little while ago and I brought
[SPEAKER_00]: back all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy just never, never did the
fem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember I was reading them do the
other day and it's like a hodge cause it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what males did he have when and what
was he using to blend with what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's something I've noticed with
like, um, a lot of Mendo breeding and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of like the old school breeding as
opposed to like, like with my mindset,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, I want to use something very,
very, very basic, like almost as close to
[SPEAKER_01]: the land race as I can, or something very
as stable as possible, um, phenotypically,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, on the male end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not seeing a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas back in the day, it looks like
they would do that single stage cross the
[SPEAKER_01]: poly hybrid, poly hybrid, poly hybrid,
poly hybrid, poly hybrid, even back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was just how it was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a lot of like what I
call hill weed, um, where people would,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they sex their plants, their males
would stay in five or 10 gallon pots off
[SPEAKER_00]: downwind in the woods somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they wanted to make fresh
seed every couple of years or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would wait and they would go collect
pollen from all their saved males and
[SPEAKER_00]: blend it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'd walk up to their patch and
their two or three favorite females that
[SPEAKER_00]: year, they would take a paint brush or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would brush the bottoms of those
plants and mark them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they're taking a blend of like,
you know, whatever it is, six or 12 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: boys, blending it together and then adding
it to like the three or four sweetest
[SPEAKER_00]: females they saw from the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do that for 10 or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have, you have a bunch of
kind of unique hill shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like, it was relatively
diverse and they wouldn't do it every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people would just try to make fresh
seed stock every two or three seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some people were nerding out and
doing it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people like seeds was like the
only thing that they knew about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just tried to freshen them up
every other season or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it sounds like I'm talking
down on it, but I actually like,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the kind of stuff I hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I hear about someone having old
hill weed seeds on something, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, let me get out of, you know,
like, I don't know why, but it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: the most appealing to me for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also from an era where there was a
whole bunch of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was before like the same 45 clones
get blended together in innumerable ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even just going back that far opens up
the gene pool in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of why, when I said
like, you know what, my buddy that I made
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds with or whatever, he breeds
seeds every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's got stuff going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got all kinds of odd stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm sure people would love to
hear it, but he, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he breeds for him or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had these, you know,
roughly 20 year old, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably from like right around when
Sensei was starting to go south.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has these maple seeds and they were,
you know, we, we crossed them to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually, we actually grew a bunch of
them out in five, six years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mendo perps maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really pretty pictures of
them, but they burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They burned, you know, so they got all the
way to like October 9th and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they went to shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of how you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you have to like figure out
where you're going to get it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it was a little easier because
most of the plants I've mentioned I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know how they work for someone that's
just getting started or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that kind of complicated thing,
not knowing how the plants they have in
[SPEAKER_00]: their stable might even breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, there could be more missteps,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so don't, don't there,
and there's things, and that don't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean like you breed things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hope that these two things come out of
them and they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you just have to try it a
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to try a different pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to see if they blend,
you know, and the more stages you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, you know, the, you have to get,
you have to get bigger, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, they, but yeah, that's,
that's roughly how you would do something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then you want me to pick
something out for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can go ahead and fire off some
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire off some traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll do it from the FEM angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the FEM angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I could do regular too, but I just
figured I'd do FEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you should do FEM because,
because that's, that's more direct and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easier for people to, to get,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to, like the main reason I
wanted to do it was I wanted to illustrate
[SPEAKER_01]: to people how hard it truly is to be able
to say my seeds are going to deliver X,
[SPEAKER_01]: Y, Z and to be consistent with what they
say they're delivering.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more that goes into it than
just I'm going to make a cross and these
[SPEAKER_01]: things smell like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way the seeds are going to
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one way, one way for people,
one way for people to look at it is like
[SPEAKER_00]: how genetics work is when you're crossing
two things that are pretty simple or
[SPEAKER_00]: especially things that are widely
divergent from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like say for instance, Neville crossing NL
five and Hayes or me crossing maple and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo P like you can see the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's certain things to look
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it Neville's growing some shit and
it's super tall and thin leafed and grows
[SPEAKER_00]: like a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays short and wide leaved and Afghan
and stout and you know, all that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and for Mike, the hybrid I was
talking about, you can look at purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, and some of the traits that
are unique to Mendo P, but if you cross
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are similar to each other,
it can be a real pain in the ass to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out which one leans what way,
which one's breeding, which way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so there's, there's an
aspect there where, um, I guess what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying is that we have entered the era
where most things are like a mass
[SPEAKER_00]: hodgepodge unless you go older strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big mix of genetics these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people start putting these things
together and you try to put like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a whatever, you know, like a fricking,
um, Cushmints, you know, by soured soured
[SPEAKER_00]: dub two things with like huge histories.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could you get?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a mass amount of shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With those two, especially Cushmints and
yeah, and the sour dubs not too
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomplicated or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so let's say, let's, let's say you
were going to hunt something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, what are you going to hunt?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what kind of traits do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you're a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're buying for some big corporation
and they have these certain wants you may,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't even have to want them,
but someone wants these and you're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: the direction on what these traits are
that they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want something that's going to be
high yielding yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: High THC potency, high THC potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can, can go up to 10 weeks, up to 10
weeks, up to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me three more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you three more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so, uh, I don't want to say
purple cause I just did that or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, let's just say that it has to
have, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to have citrus turps and wash well
because they're, because they want those,
[SPEAKER_00]: those high yielding citrus extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do we got now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, it's got a yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, high THC up to 10 weeks,
citrus wash as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: High THC wash as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should pretty much cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you those.
Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the high THC, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give myself a little more
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have, I'm going to give it
density because otherwise I would just say
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just threw that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as long as it yielded well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and wash as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the fucking, I don't think
the client is going to give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like this, this like, it would be
probably lemon G or like lemon G something
[SPEAKER_01]: like lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if I were going to make a fem line
from scratch without the obvious shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: also leaving out like cookies and OG and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I'm going to remove lemon G
because it's just too obvious and with
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: See 99 grapefruit as the start and as the
base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the male side, because I know that this
is the dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh wait, no, I'm not doing male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing female, but so it's even easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, scent expression from C 99,
the seed lines going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be more commonly
occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm choosing this female and it's
showing that it has a citrus grapefruit
[SPEAKER_01]: turps, it'll likely also brief for those
knowing C 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know we've got that covered,
but we also know C 99 is like a seven to
[SPEAKER_01]: eight weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've, we can allow ourselves to bring
up the THC with something a little more,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a little more typically sativa end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do, I would do a, a clone from
Appalachia Appalachia green crack trade
[SPEAKER_01]: dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, somebody actually just said
Appalachia by C 99 in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made it and they nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what I would do a good cut,
like a, um, a green crack dominant cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a little bit of gas of Appalachia and
to a C 99 grapefruit reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would probably, you know,
uh, do it under metal halides on tables,
[SPEAKER_01]: small plants, um, more plants,
uh, in numbers for the reversal,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to bigger plants, I'd want
smaller and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No C 99 doesn't wash super well,
but green crack washed pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I believe Appalachia will too,
especially cause the trade dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the other thing that you could
do too, is that if it ended up not washing
[SPEAKER_00]: well, then you could have a C 99
Appalachia hybrid that gave you some
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus and some bag appeal and some
weight, you know, and, and was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in within the time and he could go
another step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say he failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that got you high yielding
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had some citrus, um, but it didn't
wash very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got high potency, high yield and
you had citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're short.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to, they're trying to run
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to, they're trying to make
ice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just coming out at a percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not making their extraction happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need another step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need one more step for resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cheat and go for the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white, the white, you're going to go
for the white, the classic boost resin
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the turps aren't that great,
but I've seen it combined well with stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that is really dominant like C 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd probably add the white in there
because it was also, it also has that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that huge bag appeal and it does have good
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the C 99 citrus is strong
enough that it would carry through and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of those hybrids still and still be
dominant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can't wash it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of like deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think it would be, it would be one
of those things where like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the sheer blandness of the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't dominate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we'd have a, a C 99 by,
uh, by Appalachia by the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachia, uh, C 99 white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've reversed the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I also know the white reverse as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the other thing I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the other part is you can get a
failed reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the white reverse as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rascal did it consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, uh, and that ladies and
gentlemen is when you start talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate guys about what they want,
why things like Jack Herrera and Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herrera hybrids are blended into
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're like, I want three pounds of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta look pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want it sativa high and it's
gotta be eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they're like, Oh, C 99 Jack
Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember when Colorado,
I was going to make fun of you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I held off when Colorado went legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like, I remember that everybody
was getting three pounds of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was all hybrids of Jack Herrera,
Durbin poison, green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one more because it was
anything that threw like big, long four
[SPEAKER_01]: arm coolers, golden goats.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would just hybridize things
looking for phenos that they would get
[SPEAKER_00]: three pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everything was crossed to like one
of those four things because they all
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at it from like mathematics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, um, I think
realistically why C 99 still is popular
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even is even more so than, um,
even more so than Jack Herrera even I
[SPEAKER_01]: think C 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dominates is because of the outdoor
scene in California and because of that
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for a sativa type that's super fast
lowering the finishes in time in North
[SPEAKER_01]: Cal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tend to think Appalachia is going to
be what totally wipes C 99 out when enough
[SPEAKER_01]: people run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a good, it had a good run for a
while, uh, by a high and lonesome when he
[SPEAKER_01]: originally made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Bodie did a bunch of crosses with
it, but, um, I still think it's got it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's big run coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack does carry the turpentine turps for
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, green crack is actually a
really nice strain grown well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have got a bad name because
there was a bunch of people that would
[SPEAKER_00]: grow six to 10 pound outdoor plants kind
of be great of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got blown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you grow a nice little four to
eight ounce plant and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you treat it right, it's got some nice
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a sweet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like knock you out like,
but it's, it's pretty, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be like, if it is mostly skunk
one, it might be my favorite example.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I would say like just the way
sometimes like when it comes out really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, the bud is really green and the,
the crystal is really silvery,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's, it's got a nice sweet
turp to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a good, there's a good
chance it might be a Mendo perp skunk one
[SPEAKER_01]: of sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would trip me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's mango terpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's very purple with even a slight
bit of cold, but I mean, it's like black
[SPEAKER_00]: people say, where can I find it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing is that real green crack
was so common that all of a sudden it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like really hard to find the real one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it got renamed honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the people read its name because
real, because green crack got a bad name,
[SPEAKER_00]: like brokers put off on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when the extract era happened,
I'm convinced that there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: papaya that's just fucking green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not saying 100% all of it,
but like when you extract green crack and
[SPEAKER_00]: you wash it, it has nice tropical fruit
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people get papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people get mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people get whiffs of other things
depending on their nose or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, it, it, it has that
similar profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that regard, you know, I think because
of certain traits, there's a good chance
[SPEAKER_01]: that Mendo perp stand to be in that
lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised you never noticed that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I would honestly trip out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been wrong before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, we've had good friends of ours
that, that told me things that I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on I was like, Whoa,
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's, it's possible,
but, um, you know, I, the story of that
[SPEAKER_00]: one is pretty mysterious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very mysterious because there's,
um, the tail of, of Cecil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I, when I first encountered it
was through, through, uh, James Holland,
[SPEAKER_01]: he had green crack, but we had it labeled
as green kush with a C in our room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually said green, like written
out kush with the C.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, when I first went
online, people were talking about how well
[SPEAKER_01]: Cecil C has a kush with the C.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a long time, me and Cecil tried to
meet up so we could talk about this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we finally talked, it sounds like
his kush with the C was very skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he says the one that he said to San
Diego was very skunky, which is not like
[SPEAKER_01]: the green crack or the green kush that was
in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know if it originates in San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it originates in Mendo or
up, up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be from fricking Oregon for all
we know with a different name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it made it to SoCal with the name,
uh, green kush with the C and then became
[SPEAKER_01]: green crack after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are throwing around different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking like, well, how do you
source what you're breeding with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, um, you know,
like I never really did a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding projects where I had to go out
and like have a treasure map and find the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, mostly you end up breeding with
stuff you have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were creating a hypothetical situation
and I tend to have a, so I tended to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: things in my library, not hypothetical
things I'd have to get, but like actual
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I possess because that's just
where my mind goes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be infinitely harder to like be
like, oh, well I need to do a project
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to take three or four steps
and I need to gather a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are going to be new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's an aspect people are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Filos, Filos can't actually
determine family relationships the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day, one day we will sit down and a
few of us will tell the story about how we
[SPEAKER_01]: put Filos' science to the test by using
known clones, known parentage of these
[SPEAKER_01]: clones and submitted them to Filos to see
if they could truly determine parentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an aspect, yeah, there's an
aspect too where people are saying green
[SPEAKER_00]: crack and blue dream got played out right
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect, because I live in
Mendocino County or whatever, and for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time it was sort of like the heart of
outdoor and stuff in California before it
[SPEAKER_00]: spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you would have plants that
were really nice on their own,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the blue dream or the green crack or
the berry white or the this or whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be, and they get, there's an era
where they're really popular and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: moving really well and people are growing
really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice examples of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a point where people
realize how much money they can make and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can throw out 99 plants and get eight
pounds of plant and you do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden there's all this B
and C grade of the same strain and it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of harshes the strain out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times people will be like,
oh, that strain sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what happened is the market got
exploded by a bunch of low quality
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous waves of it because it was super
profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it moves on and so people move
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a little four ounce plant of
green crack or blue dream, you'd probably
[SPEAKER_00]: be pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow it nice, you grow a little three,
four ounce plant of it, you'd probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked and so are your buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue dream, because I was still very
heavily involved in the seed business when
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dream got real big and all that got
blown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I saw happen right before my eyes
was there was a few of us that made S1s of
[SPEAKER_01]: that original cut and released it in some
good hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we saw major Spanish companies
making seed lines called blue dream that
[SPEAKER_01]: had nothing to do with blue dream the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would combine like a blueberry and
their hazes, whatever they had and put
[SPEAKER_01]: that on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to name any names or
anything, but certain companies would buy
[SPEAKER_01]: these, import them to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of a sudden these blue dream seeds
were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The attitude was doing giveaways with
everything you bought, you would get these
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dream seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blue dream hit the country in mass,
but it wasn't blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was blueberry haze from some Spanish
company with the California market getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of the actual blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's an aspect, too,
where I think that for most plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a window of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it varies plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually think a lot of the indoor
look is just because people are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively small plants compared to
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so you're only asking a
plant to give you, say, like one to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have a vastly different look than if
you're asking that plant to give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound or two pounds or three pounds or
eight pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had I've had times where it was
like when we were transplanting and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: like some plants got broken off at the
stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would grow these like depths and
these plants would get like a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like helpers wouldn't want to
throw away the ones we broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'd be like a branch this big,
a stem this big with a few branches coming
[SPEAKER_00]: off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we pulled that stuff down,
that stuff looked so amazing compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to like the the rest of it,
because it was like three ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just super frosty and choked
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an aspect certainly with
different plants of like there's a size
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you get I like Blue Dream at four to
six ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it was like just fucking
perfect every fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most weed is if it's going to be good
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a decent that it can it
can get that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some plants can get to a half
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants can get to a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a there's a point of
diminishing quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where it's like the resin
doesn't stretch or the turps don't stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: or the plant just has to put so much
energy into its stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's structure and it's how it's going
to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have enough to put into,
you know, it's the quality of its weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's people that swear that
small little plants and one gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or or is the headiest weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's I know that when CSI was
talking about ship buds sour that he talks
[SPEAKER_01]: about is like some of the best smoke he's
ever had out of millions of plants he's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always says that, you know,
it was, you know, one gallon pot and flour
[SPEAKER_01]: or power flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so there's an aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect there where it's like
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I used to actually do a bunch of
breeding that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I got smart, smarter, I suppose I
should say, because I used to just grow up
[SPEAKER_00]: all these fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And granted, the era was different,
but still you'd get all this random weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that you didn't like very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because let's face it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're breeding, it's like you're
only going to like so much of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then I got and then I got
smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of like blooming the seeds,
I would grow them up and I would take cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would put them into like a one
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would grow like on a you know,
I might grow like 50 or 100 plants on a
[SPEAKER_00]: four by eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going for like a single
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that half ounce will tell me,
does it have the turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have the high?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe I can grow out a hundred
things at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's small enough to still know you're
getting the quality, the ultimate quality
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can get from that plant without
having to push it hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're starting from a clone because
that's the other thing that I realized is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of times I wanted to see like
what a clone would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you only get one shot at the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only ever see that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to act differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got more consistent when I just like
when I would just take I would breed and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would I wouldn't flower the seed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would flower the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would want to see what they did as
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I could flower almost like a sea
of green style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could have a hundred or a
hundred and fifty things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're like, you know,
ten to twenty ounce, ten to twenty grams
[SPEAKER_00]: each, maybe a zip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I've been trying to teach
everybody that's watched like Breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndicate or my live streams since I
started doing them is when you buy seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you buy seeds and you're popping
seeds, you know, a lot of people run into
[SPEAKER_01]: sexual instability issues, all kinds of
other issues, or they like it the one time
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't like it the rest and they
don't understand why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always tell them, I always
say, don't worry about blooming the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about blooming the seed mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloom the clone mom, because that's what
you're going to see every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you need to make your choices
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll at ninety nine percent of the
time, any sexual instability issues are
[SPEAKER_01]: gone with a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety nine percent time for whatever
reason, that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just different hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I used to get two
ounces, four ounces, five ounces,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight ounces, all these different plants,
all these different sizes, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, it's hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can actually go through a bunch of
plants and you really don't need to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't need more than,
you know, ten or twenty grams should give
[SPEAKER_00]: you like a really good idea of whether or
not which ones you like enough to like
[SPEAKER_00]: work with again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be done on one or two four by
eights.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even take that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then you and then,
you know, I would just toss the seed mom
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would just keep clones, you know,
clones as backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as they grew a little bit,
just flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to see like what the main the
main stem would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to get spears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's not the only way to
do it, but it is a way for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people these days are going to
have smaller size areas to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you did that into a
greenhouse, you could look what you could
[SPEAKER_00]: look through three or four hundred plants
if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hard part is going to be testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is labeling, drying it, keeping it
separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, Caleb, he's got fucking
hangers with all kinds of color coded
[SPEAKER_00]: labels on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notes and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're trying to keep them all
separate in different plastic bag or
[SPEAKER_00]: different jars or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're trying to like smoke and
take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about like the downside of
doing too big of a pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like how do you you know,
like there's an aspect of like doing too
[SPEAKER_00]: big of a pop is cool in the sense that
when you're looking for certain physical
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics, you're going through more
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can you can you can sift
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, you know, smoke
testing, let's say you have 50 things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that takes a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you usually got to engage friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you have thirteen thousand
things, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really, you know, I mean,
you're you're not really pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing some pheno hunting,
but you realize that like the vast
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of it, it's going to get lost to
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's the only time I mean,
you know, we have a pretty big thing going
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some of Caleb's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's like we really get to see
what's in the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it expresses.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the vast majority of them aren't going
to be kept for any reason.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority can't be smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just to get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's say you're popping two
thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how are you going to smoke that
within a certain amount of period unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you just have people cheap and for free
all day?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those motherfuckers don't go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's an aspect where really
like for a hobby gardener, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of depending on how people smoke,
even if you did 60 or 70 things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would take you, you know, if you smoked
two or three of them a day, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would take you, you know, almost a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To sort through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you know, and then you
could also have certain kinds of criteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some things you smoke one bowl of
and it doesn't have the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just immediately, you know,
but then it's like how fine of a comb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people say cut a clone late in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of there's a lot
of euros that don't like to keep backup
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and they'll literally do this thing
where they'll leave all the bottoms on
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants and they'll bloom them and
their favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just like move before the plants
fully finished and revedge the bottoms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the problem with that,
that there's nothing wrong with that
[SPEAKER_00]: method because a lot of times the easiest
things to revedge are like the poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered out, you know, wispy shit on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can cut a plant down and smoke it
and be revedging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does take months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a few months for it to start
kicking back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it a ton for a long time when I
would do Fino hunts because I would try to
[SPEAKER_01]: do as big of a Fino hunt as I could do in
with as many different lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what usually ended up happening was
that I couldn't keep, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: four clones of every single thing that I
was hunting through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to get really good at revedging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get it right every fucking time
and figure out how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually I figured out how to do
that and be consistent with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard and it takes a long fucking
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy that I was mentioning that I did
the maple project, he was he used to
[SPEAKER_00]: saying he does 50, 60 things at a time and
it's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like you have lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that easy to like it's one thing
to get baked every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing to like take notes and
see how you feel and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking for certain aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you either have to be a super harsh
dick or it takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and a lot of times what sucks,
you know, is that, you know, the runty
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty fucked up plant that you almost
killed ends up being the most interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: one to smoke and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the ones that had all the
structure and growth and vigor that you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted were were just, you know,
OK compared to some of those other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always the scrawny shitty one that
doesn't want to revedge the most stubborn
[SPEAKER_01]: one that's usually the one I want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, like, I mean,
imagine imagine if, you know, the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: craze happened, but like O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: grew like Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really would be Blue Dream
billionaires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and all that because it's
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the that's the kind of intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could talk about that for a
minute because well, it's interesting is
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was talking about like when things
went legal in Colorado and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: all these high yielding plants started
getting bred into all the indoor because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what met the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a risk as things become legal
that the weird runty fucked up offshoots
[SPEAKER_00]: that we all know and love that end up
becoming like our elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they don't meet the
production model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I remember even even when Subcool
was at the height of breeding fame,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would call it even what he what he had,
what I would call his genuine fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point, that dude was pretty famous
and he was putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: My shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to interrupt them for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our homie from Hawaii was saying
taking cuts two or three weeks into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay small and about the time they
revedge, you're finishing up the round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what CSI does a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: His primary method is to take clones,
clean up the bottoms about two weeks into
[SPEAKER_00]: that into bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that and then that slows down and
they freak out for a while, but they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of are on the same timing as your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around the time you figure out which
ones are good or hope, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they get because you can get them
too big and then you're chopping them
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say Subcool,
he would call a lot of seeds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling stage, like in the seedling
stage, he would do major culling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always a big opponent of that,
because I found that like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: slower growing stuff can be just as
amazing a keepers for different reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but for a while that that was in
cannabis and still kind of is a common
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that if it's weak as a seedling,
cull it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, there's nothing wrong with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In in a certain aspect, but then it's just
making it harder to find what you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're trying to guarantee that
it's going to be in a strong and vigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's one thing we know about
cannabis is that like the weak,
[SPEAKER_00]: the weak shitty ones sometimes have a
tendency of being like the market's
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Oji Kush, I can't even believe that
wasn't called at the beginning just to how
[SPEAKER_01]: floppy the land and it has so many traits
that are that are hard, hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's talk about, you know,
do you know the thing that I will put this
[SPEAKER_00]: number one all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe it was called the quays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the quays, the wild one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How how can you grow something that takes
that long?
[SPEAKER_00]: And every bud is like a tiny fingernail
sized fucking calyx ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes one of the more famous
strains in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a labor of love, because there's
a bunch of people that would look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: halfway through and be like, what a mess,
death.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I got phenos like that or expressions
like that from Alaskan ice seeds that I
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased from Seed Madness, I want to say
in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it spit out phenos like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were immediately called like,
I don't think anything of it was before I
[SPEAKER_01]: had ever seen or run the quay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you would just kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, this is super fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the worst thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is horrible shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, yeah, this is fucking
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kill it, you know,
and that's actually what Neville did to
[SPEAKER_00]: about half his hayseeds that popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they were so sparse and fucked up
that he didn't realize what he had and he
[SPEAKER_00]: called them and then he smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, somebody was saying,
oh, GKB, oh, GKB is an excellent example
[SPEAKER_00]: of something that would never make a
production model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, super slow, takes forever to veg,
doesn't yield that much, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always think of tomatoes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's been this heirloom tomato
sort of Renaissance in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when people are like you go to the
grocery store, you see lots of delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tomatoes are bred for size and weight
and color and do not rot and do not split
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavors way down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tomatoes that get stuffed into most
people's grocery stores are like big money
[SPEAKER_00]: making watery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all the production values are
paramount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part where it's delicious and it
tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has the flavors that we want,
like we can't force them to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why a lot of people think store
bought tomatoes suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why I stick with cherry
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but what I mean by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I mean by that is that like as
cannabis goes into a production model and
[SPEAKER_00]: they start looking at square footage and
cost and yield and this and that and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else, there could be very
different pressures put on what strains
[SPEAKER_00]: make it to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG would never have made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG KB would never have made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quiz would never have made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot of varieties out there
for one reason or another that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: fit somebody's production model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always surprised when cookies showed
up, like the form cut because it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: low yielding, like so, so low yielding
compared to what was typically going
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even most OG cushions had been they had
figured them out to make them yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cookies was just so low yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shocked that it ever got compared to
commercial viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would have without.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was an aspect where prices
were starting to fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and Instagram was young and it was
like a perfect moment where it gained a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of popularity and then it sold for
high dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was almost kind of like the same
thing with Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like and our buddy resin, it's like,
sure, you might not get as much weight as
[SPEAKER_00]: you were getting off other things until
you figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were selling it for seven grand
a pound, you really didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that there was some there was
some like, oh, I can get lower yields off
[SPEAKER_00]: this baked into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but and it's still yeah,
makes way more money than otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an aspect now where it's
like, yeah, biomass people are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, like weight on,
you know, wet weight, how much I can
[SPEAKER_00]: extract, what's my yield, what's my this
where the previous selection process in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was entirely consumer based.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all these fans needed a bunch of
people at the other end willing to buy it
[SPEAKER_00]: for top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what drove the purple craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what drove sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why sour was the best selling weed
in America was because there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: massive corridor on the East Coast that
this couldn't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then Kush had its whole
moment in Southern California and
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then cookies was the bay and
then, you know, and you have skittles
[SPEAKER_00]: winning all these awards and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of that stuff is I mean,
we used to joke when we first got the real
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles where it was like you'd start
vegging next year's gap now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it was like,
oh, let's give it a good six month veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first time my buddy,
I had I had a good friend of mine that got
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles kind of before it was it was
named that as much and he grew these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had Lake County, beautiful sun,
400 gallon pots, you know, all our games.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called me up all panicked and
wanted me to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was like back in the trees era.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm walking through.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has sat diesels and green cracks and,
you know, different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all, you know, nine,
10 feet tall, trellised out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you walk to this section and
there's like five skittles and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like come up to like my waist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all wide and like little
chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his buddy was like, oh, I'll give you
like four times this as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're looking at these like tiny
little runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all started at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought he was fucking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just didn't realize that it grew eight
times as slow as anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so there's that aspect,
too, where it was like skittles would
[SPEAKER_00]: never pass any kind of production model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles looks like they've got a goddamn
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But skittles is ugly as flour for the most
part, you know, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally a pre cookie person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm fine with ugly flour that works
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's very slow growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit mold prone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but none of that mattered when
it was winning a bunch of awards for
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're just testing the extract
and the hash was fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that was my point about the
potency aspect, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, I mean, like it used to
be a major deal if the flour wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not such a deal breaker anymore
with the extract market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, in fact, I'll you know,
I was joking with you about citrus and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was it was a little I get that me saying
citrus gave you a bunch of pads because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a bunch of kinds of citrus and
citrus for people that don't know also
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to breed fairly dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, orange things a lot of time pass
orange, grapefruit, grapefruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon, lemon, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty dominant turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but a lot of times those those
citrus cuts are pretty moderate to mild
[SPEAKER_00]: potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really a lot of ones that test
very high or by themselves are
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I almost think that like tangy came
along at a perfect time because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a big skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am shouting out DNA or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a big citrus skunk plant at a
time when a lot of people had forgotten
[SPEAKER_00]: about citrus because it was so unpopular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coincided right with the extraction
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that citrus turp passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at the time, a lot of other turps kind
of ended up tasting like axle grease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also was not named Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most importantly, some people were like,
oh, it's not named Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and so and so I really I don't know if
it would have caught on without that B.H
[SPEAKER_00]: .O.
[SPEAKER_00]: era being timed right then when people
were getting nails and dab kit and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different little tools and accoutrements
that went along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like you take something
that's like 15 percent THC and not that
[SPEAKER_00]: potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you extract it and it's 80 percent,
well, now, OK, now we're somewhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be a long lasting high,
but it'll get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's something and we can keep
talking about this, but I know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that people wanted you to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that we missed last
time or two times ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was your drying tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me I'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just say because people are
throwing in Calio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that big hunt that we were doing
down south or whatever, I ran a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI's Calio hybrids and I was actually
amazed at how sativa it read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really it really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even things that were pretty indica
that I thought would be would lean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were big, tall, branchy, orange
smelling, you know, kind of grandpa weed
[SPEAKER_00]: looking phenos and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was it was a lot more in different
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot more sativa than I was
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Calio went through periods where it
became so unpopular, it was almost
[SPEAKER_00]: unsellable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a type of Calio is the only weed
someone ever brought back to me and said
[SPEAKER_01]: not not this didn't get me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect with almost with a
lot of very citrusy weed that's like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where people find the high to be some some
people find the high to be fleeting or
[SPEAKER_00]: super short lived or they just develop a
tolerance to it after two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and other people are fine
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a percentage of people that
develop a tolerance and find it boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a difference in citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some plants that are like sweet
citrus that have almost a creaminess to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's ones that smell like you
just spray an orange cleaner in your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very astringent.
[SPEAKER_00]: An orange just pissed orange or a lemon,
you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just very like astringent and weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like you sucked on a chemical,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hate that that long lingering
mouth coating lemon like lemon G and lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you just burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm one of those people I burn
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine to have it in rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was stuck with it as my only weed
for a month, I would be so bummed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't even put it in rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the tip flavor at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a moment where with BHO and
certain things when that was super popular
[SPEAKER_00]: before rosin was really hitting that those
citrus turps came through really clean and
[SPEAKER_00]: clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people made a lot of money off
fucking lemon G in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lemon G and the Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Tangy sort of rocketed DNA to
being super busy for four or five years
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crockett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, whatever,
whatever, whatever combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Crockett, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as drying tech, man,
that's a that's a big subject,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I could chat about it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is your specialty, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that, like, you know,
there's a lot of people that throw a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff out there as far as like what's
drying tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of like copycat
stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, because I've always been a
smoker, I was always interested in making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure my weed came out nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And curing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of times people put an
enormous amount of of weight on what they
[SPEAKER_00]: feed their plant and all that and like all
these different environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those those things can all throw in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't cure it the right way,
a lot of that gets overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an aspect where there's no
point in my career rally, really,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was competing on scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was always way bigger people than
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always tried to make sure even if
there was a flood up in my neck of the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods, that my weed was just good enough
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of it's going to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, you had to and
then on top of that, too, it's like coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from like a my own perspective is like I
never grew my head stash super separate
[SPEAKER_00]: too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I needed it all to be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard, people are saying,
let's hear the dry tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's like but it's just like the
breeding tech or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like there's goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things I had to figure
out was that and this is kind of what like
[SPEAKER_00]: separately led to curing is that there's
this thing up here that we now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent, that there's this thing we used
to call that called the flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flood used to be November,
December, January.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was way too hard to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's because, you know, people would
go on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would go to see their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around the holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are back home with grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if enough links in those chains
disappear, people end up sitting on stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people figured out that there was
a dry spell in spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you were if you were smart,
you would hold on to most of your stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: until spring when it would be both much
easier and much more lawyer price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the flood happening this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, the flood is the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flood is seemingly never stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are we are living in water world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been no receding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been no price spiking going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been this is Atlantis, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this is yes, this is the ice caps
melting as far as price pricing goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but what happened is, is that you ended
up needing to figure out like people
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that if they trimmed all their
weed in in fall, it both cost a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money because you had to pay the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the most part, unless you
were really careful about how you stored
[SPEAKER_00]: it, your weed was worse in spring when you
had to when you had to sell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes you were growing enough
that like you weren't even with the size
[SPEAKER_00]: trim crew you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to take you a while to even
get to that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to be able to dry and cure it
right in a way that it stayed nice for a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's an aspect where you can
always like if you it's basically like you
[SPEAKER_00]: get one shot to do it the right way and
you can like adapt along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you fuck up too bad, you've just
ruined it for that round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that's like I haven't really
said anything about the tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's like a reasoning behind it of
how you get there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and for people that aren't growers that
are listening, I'm sorry if you're bored
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, but because it's about to get
a little specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what the way I look at it is
that when you're drying weed, I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: either cut the plant down whole or chop it
into chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively relatively big chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just said it will teach me your
ways in an eight by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're worried about temps or you're
worried about water loss or you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little extra dry, you can leave it in
bigger pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those pieces will hold more
moisture because there's a lot of moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have really good control of your
environment, you can chop them into
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller mid-sized pieces and hang them
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just hang them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can you can use hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use, you know, just a variety of
things that allows you to create lines or
[SPEAKER_00]: walls is basically how it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I leave all the water leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take off any water leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that the things
that fuck up your buds are are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: air, heat and light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the things that start to oxidize
your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start to mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what all that family do is that they
fold down over the flower and they
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially like if you have fans for air
movement and stuff like that, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: generally blowing on the fan leaves,
not on directly on your flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's making your flower darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's protecting it from wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's protecting it from from white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's protecting it from the various things
that might degrade it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as your plant starts to dry,
it'll suck that moisture from all those
[SPEAKER_00]: from all those leaves into itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what you're trying to
do is you're trying to get you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to slowly sweat out enough
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got enough chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want this to be a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see all kinds of things where people
talk about 60, 60, you know, 60 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: and 60 percent humidity for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do disagree on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the 60 percent humidity is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that's actually like a
little too cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it really slows down
transpiration at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the 60s is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I like, you know, mid 60s anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realistically speaking, from mid 60s to
low 70s, you're pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in my opinion, like there's
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like what you're going to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's an aspect of like there's
a there's an aspect of when you're hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: it the first three or four days,
a whole bunch of water is going to flow
[SPEAKER_00]: out of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how much weed you have and
how much space it is, like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really matter if you have a stuffed four
by eight or you have a stuffed big garage
[SPEAKER_00]: or you have a stuffed warehouse or
whatever, whatever size it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's stuffed, you know, it can be
really hard to have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to pull that much water out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people lose control or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the end in a lot of dehum's don't
even like to work at 60 degrees either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having them a bit warmer really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one thing people should all
look at is that there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a low grain refrigerant
dehum, you probably don't have a dehum
[SPEAKER_00]: that's suitable for dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most dehum's are rated for a certain
temperature, which is quite warm and a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain humidity, which is quite hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should look at like where their
operating temperature is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the dehum says it stops operating at
58 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't run your room at 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should probably run it at 70 and give
your dehum a chance to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but if you have a low grain refrigerant
dehum that it'll work at those temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's basically a mode where it's
like you're just trying to make sure your
[SPEAKER_00]: weed doesn't mold and you get that
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to get that humidity out
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people literally exhaust
air and bring in fresh air because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: like if the temperatures and outside are
fine or whatever, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people try to do a combination of air
conditioners and dehum's.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're basically trying to keep it
somewhere between the mid 60s to low 70s
[SPEAKER_00]: and temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, somewhere between ideally
60 percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't panic if it's 65 or 70 or even
74 or five for the first day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it doesn't that first day,
there's so much moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on how much vegetative
material in a small space, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's people are talking about
dipping it in hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are doing that because they're
trying to pass testing with various PM or
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals or different stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide is is a it oxidizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to put that on good weed for
no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to it's going to oxidize
various turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to oxidize various compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to it's going to lower the
quality of your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so there's an aspect of and look,
I mean, these are just like people can hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me up later.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just like basic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually kind of hard to just walk
through like all the little details of how
[SPEAKER_00]: you would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, I'm just trying to give
you like a range, whatever your equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might be able to use outside
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might be able to use
dehumidifiers and air conditioners,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even dehumidifiers and heaters,
depending on where they live and what time
[SPEAKER_00]: of year it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're just trying to keep the plant
in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after three or four days, your plant's
going to shrink a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it shrinks a bunch, then you're
in a mode where you're going to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: see most of that water is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be a lot easier for you to
moderate your drying room.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as long as as long as you have the
equipment in place that's going to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: work right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really battling in that middle
section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just trying to keep it at those
same temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now another three or four days passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're in the third stage stage of
drying, which is actually kind of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: because you risk your plants getting too
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take them down often after six
or seven days, they're still got too much
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in the stem and you try to bin
them up or bag them up and that sweats
[SPEAKER_00]: right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to go 10 or 14 days on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually 10 or 12 of them doing it for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually more like 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but you might actually have I
have humidifiers where sometimes I add
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture bad back into my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it might be fall and it might
have not rained in months and it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: bone dry and 20 percent humidity outside
and your AC is removing some moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is your whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you turn off all your D Humps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you turn off your fans and
because you're just trying to conserve
[SPEAKER_00]: that moisture sometimes and you're just
trying to get through that next three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four days to let the chlorophyll on the
moisture slowly sweat out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's too dry, just your stuff will
start to get crisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going low and slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just want to say just leave it
at 60 and 60 like the Jungle Boys or some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and you just like let it be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually I think that there's like
three distinct stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you treat them different,
it's a little easier to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 60 60 can't work for all types of
blood densities either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mean, it's got to be some range.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of copycat stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just kind of trying to give
generals and maybe I'm talking fast
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's kind of a big subject or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and if you have if you have the right
environment, if you have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, like you can actually you
could you can keep it three weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not like, you know,
you can actually, I mean, with the right
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and the right inside, you can
leave it up there for a while if you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't tend to like to because I often
have to refill it or I just find that the
[SPEAKER_00]: next stage I can actually get a lot more
control doing what I do next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where a lot of people fuck it
up, in my opinion, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've like talked about
anything too revolutionary yet or any shit
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's where it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mess is that there's an aspect
where after 10 or 11 days, like people
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to think that they need to store
their weed at a consistency that's perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: for smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you actually probably don't want to
store it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably want to store it like a
little bit too moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you what I end up doing is at
that point, like I think that's where the
[SPEAKER_00]: cure begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people think you cure in
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually cure on the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take it off the stem, you're not
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most curing and like if you talk
to tobacco farmer people or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they'll talk about this all day or,
you know, they grow tobacco for cigars or
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an interplay between the stem and
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem and the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant can as long as it's all
connected, the plant can move that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture around itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I tend to do is that when it comes
time, I will take like a bunch of like
[SPEAKER_00]: literally like a store like grocery style
paper bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, you got to feel when
you're about to seal something up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to think like, you know,
how like osmosis and like like aromas and
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and all that will try to
equalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, I've got a bunch of fan
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is somebody was mentioning
earlier, when you do it that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: bucking is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is when you buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I put my stuff in there,
I take most of the no sweet leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I take most of the big leaf off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I chop it into chunks that fit
into like the I'm not holding my hands
[SPEAKER_00]: open the right way, but I chop it into
chunks that fit into the paper bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so think about how long a paper
bag is and they're about that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start stacking it with things
that have most not all, but most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: family for move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And left on the stem, but chopped into
chunks that fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that that bin can you that that
paper bag can usually hold between,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, 400 and 600, 700 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you fold it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put it into a contractor bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this might not sound too crazy,
but what it does is that you then fill
[SPEAKER_00]: that contractor bag with say, depending on
how tall the contractor is, like six or
[SPEAKER_00]: nine bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's, here's where a bunch of
people fuck it up in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it is most people when they take
it down off the line, they just throw it
[SPEAKER_00]: as is into a, into a plastic bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build the bin, shut the bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a super common way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason why I don't like that is
because what happens is, is you have all
[SPEAKER_00]: that extra stem and you have all that
extra family, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shit smells like hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff that smells like
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff that smells green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff that has all the aromas
that you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put a bunch of weed or
anything into a sealed container,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times all that aroma tries to
equalize itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to send that aroma all the
way through your week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by picking off most of the big families
and then by chopping the excess stem off
[SPEAKER_00]: and just leaving it on stem chunks,
that are big enough to fit in the bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: you remove most of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the vast majority of what's in that
paper bag is either sweet leaf or flour
[SPEAKER_00]: with some associated stem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you fill that thing up and you
turn it over and you put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where it's also different than
bin tech, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a bin, most people use like the black
and yellow totes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like 25 or 30 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you fill one of those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put a lid on and there's nowhere
for it to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's two feet of cannabis weighing
down on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that bottom third like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got weight pushing down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got moisture pushing down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere for it to breathe,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put like six or nine paper bags
into a contractor,
[SPEAKER_00]: they hold their shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold their shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never have a few thousand grams
weighing down on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because they stack and that
paper holds its shape and the paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper actually is porous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of a bin where you have two or
three or four pounds, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeds stuffed into a bin and then
sealed and there's no breathability,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those bags get to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that breathing is what brings the
moisture slowly from the center to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can put it in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tie it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you did it just the right way,
it'll stay stable like that for straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up weeks to months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done, I've done like experiments
with friends or whatever, where like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you trim some up within a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two months later you go back and all
the stuff that was still in the paper bags
[SPEAKER_00]: has a bunch of turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, where the stuff that got trimmed
has started to oxidize, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an aspect there where the
reason why we came to this is that for
[SPEAKER_00]: one, you don't end up with a million bins
that reek that you have to sterilize and
[SPEAKER_00]: clean all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with like super light
contractor bags and paper bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say you seal up the contractor
bag and it like, you open it up and you
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up and you were a little too fast
and it's a little too moist, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can then just open and leave the
contractor bag open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if it's, if you really fucked up,
you might have to take those bags out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they all breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can open them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you really messed up and you
were too aggressive about it, and you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: down there and it feels wet and damp and
uncomfortable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually take an empty paper bag
and your full one and you can dump it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the bottom is the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just fluffed it essentially,
and you can do that one by one to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only if you screw up and you
realize that after you've sealed it up for
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, it's not as stable as you want it
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was too much moisture in there and
it actually got rewet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get it to the moisture level you
want, you can seal it back up and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've had a situation where
like a lot of times in outdoor season in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall, it took us quite a while to get
through all the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to store it in such a way that
you could, you know, you, you would,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would keep the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that definitely made it all the way to
our parties and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I remember smoking that,
you know, after fact, and it was still
[SPEAKER_01]: just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that first year especially,
Pip and myself and, and home, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the friends, like we went and all that
weed in those, in those bags and jars,
[SPEAKER_00]: we pulled out of, that's why most of it
was untrimmed, you know, or partially
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just pulled it out of the bags just
like that tech and it had been sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: there for two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of our close friends,
to be perfectly honest, even in our circle
[SPEAKER_00]: and our discord and stuff like that,
that have tried this method, keep using
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ways you can refine it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of skimmed over a certain parts,
but cause there's depth and there's things
[SPEAKER_00]: that can come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like a modular, small,
the large scale way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people, like they talk
about curing in turkey bags or curing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually not really curing your
fermenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're changing gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people talk about burping,
that's not actually curing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what makes it fermenting as opposed to
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this, there's this, I mean,
it's like, I don't want to, I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to misspeak and have somebody jump in that
knows more than me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, but in general, what it boils
down to is there's some acts, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: interplay between each of the flowers
being connected to the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean you can't put it in a
jar and it improves over the first few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks in the jar too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like a lot of times
people think they remove it from all,
[SPEAKER_00]: they remove it from the stem way too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if you let that, that few weeks,
I would even tell people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you put it in that contractor,
just leave it alone for a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it alone for 10 days and then go
back to it and then trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had, we've had a bunch of
friends that have tried it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all keep using it and they all
feel like it improved their personal
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I wanted you to tell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, there's an aspect and
there's, there's, there's parts of it
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, like, like I said,
I glossed over certain things because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of long and involved and then you
could ask a bunch of detailed questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went on and I wasn't trying to like
drown people in, but anybody can reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: about it because I want people to have
better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, it is true low and slow,
but I definitely think there's drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's curing and then there's jarring
and a lot of people just dry and jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they miss that middle part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doesn't mean your weed's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like I've found,
you know, for a lot of the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, that I get better flavor profiles
when you give that plant a week or 10 days
[SPEAKER_00]: or two weeks to interplay between the stem
and the flower and back and forth and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that and cure in a big pile into itself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because back in the day,
when things moved really fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times people would, I just smoke
some in New York, people would,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would just dry weed as fast as they
could get it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would have a little bit of that
chlorophyll tang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had somebody try to tell me it was like
they only smoke it like that because after
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks, the live terpenes fade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, I've smoked plenty
of weed that was dried fast for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, yeah, you know,
and so, yeah, people can be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, yeah, most people skip curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go from right from drying,
you know, right from drying to jarring,
[SPEAKER_00]: right from jarring, right from drying to
packaging, you know, and, and this tech,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all that stuff is really available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take up a ton of space in your
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can condense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reuse the, the, the paper bags
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you treat them right, you know,
you can shove a ton of them into one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two contractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's light as a feather, you know,
it's modular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can fit in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can fit in a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can, they can stack on top of each
other because, and, and there's one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: like, and you pointed out, sometimes you
might need to fluff it, but it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause not so as a professional fluffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to get that joke in for
like five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need to go, sometimes you
need to make, you know, from bottom to
[SPEAKER_00]: top, you need to really just change up
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, that's the thing is it's
like, when you do it perfect, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to go through like,
because it is weird and we have close
[SPEAKER_00]: friends of ours that when we first,
when I first showed them how to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they thought they were putting it away too
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times they don't realize that
it stores really well like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then sometimes it does get too
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it gets a little mushy or it's scary
wet or whatever, and you need to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a variety of ways you can
let it breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, this is like,
I just don't, I don't like plastic bins
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't breathe at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens, what happens in
anaerobic environments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just creates stale air and moisture
hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different times, different kinds of
processes happen in low oxygen versus
[SPEAKER_00]: higher oxygen environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an act, there's an aspect
of that where it's like, so even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: screw up a few times, there's like various
ways you can get out of panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes all I had to do was just open
the top of my contractor and leave it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the living room for, you know,
a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or half a day and all of a sudden the
excess moisture had breathed and escaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those paper bags are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they will absorb a little bit of
excess moisture without becoming damp,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, you know, there's,
there's just, it just keeps the weight
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what you don't want is you
don't want pressure and low oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you want things to be able
to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want things to be able to like slowly
take that last bit of moisture out from
[SPEAKER_00]: the center of the buds and from the center
of the stems and bring it out into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, your, your weed
burns better, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your weed burns better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a lot of strains over a long
period of time and I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you, you grow it one way
for a while and you're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you grow this other way and you,
you don't get the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get the dry right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, Oh, I fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my weed, it's like three months old
still burns a little nicer than this weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I just got fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you, you know, and then your
friends do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have feedback loops and then,
you know, and then you, you go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's a lot of things people can get
all tech and you can go to like moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: in the buds and higher meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you like Hill tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you like observational tech
that's basically by experience and by
[SPEAKER_00]: feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have some basic ground rules
on when not to panic about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, we have a buddy too that
like is people were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation earlier as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have a, we have a good friend
of ours that we worked through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he lives in very high elevation and
his weed dried way too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way, way too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to really slow it down
and get cures and he's ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not saying it's like, this is like
the be all end all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that it's worked for me
and my friends for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an excellent way to cure weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I did bring a bunch of weed to the
candle Illuminati parties dried because
[SPEAKER_00]: the candle Illuminati parties were in
December.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that weed came down in October or
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was one to two months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that you guys got old of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the weed that I brought,
whether it was trimmed or untrimmed,
[SPEAKER_00]: all went through that whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do think it brings out
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a way to like not screw it
up at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as far as our group goes,
like it seems like everybody kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: contributes one, some more than one,
but everybody kind of brings one major
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I think of not so his drying tech
is the one thing I think he's brought to
[SPEAKER_01]: the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's changed it for our group as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I wanted to bring it up
because this is a lot of skilled people in
[SPEAKER_01]: our group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's, if it's changing their minds,
it might be something that other people
[SPEAKER_01]: are into too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, there's,
there's, there's patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: To it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ways you can adapt it here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I've just found it to be really
flexible and I haven't found anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me better quality weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not done at all on the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the commercial market suffers
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the whole curing aspect and
the whole treating it nice for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be, you know, shoved away to
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you, the problem is if you
mess it up, you can always rehydrate weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's never the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if you dried it low and slow and got it
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it a certain stickiness and
a certain ratio, it can stay good like
[SPEAKER_00]: that for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get it overly dry, which a lot
of people used to do, and then they'd re
[SPEAKER_00]: moisten for sale, it'll be all right for a
week or two, but not that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll go back to being a lot,
a lot blander.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if you do it the right way,
you can get like a weird sponginess that
[SPEAKER_00]: has enough give to have some moisture in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but enough, you know, but it,
but it's, it's really well cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and not so much that it just goes
poof in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear crunching, that's not that
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to hear crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean the, the, the,
you know, it'll probably still get you
[SPEAKER_00]: high, but a lot of delicate, a lot of
delicate terpenes, orange peels in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sack, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not saying it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, but I'm saying like
your weed is never as good if you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: rehydrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to rehydrate it, you didn't
store it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, you know, yeah, people
saying this didn't, it didn't work at
[SPEAKER_00]: scale on his 30 lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like, you know, uh, I mean,
I did it with like when we, when Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: first went legal and we were allowed
10,000 square feet, which is far larger
[SPEAKER_00]: than a 30 lighter, you know, um,
small by today's standards right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still, um, you know, it's,
it's, it's a chunk of pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then on top of this too,
it's really easy to do this at a small
[SPEAKER_00]: scale for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just trying to smoke better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you might only have,
you might only have one or two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: contractors or something, you know,
if you're just growing for your personal
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and it's for you or whatever,
like then it's really easy to like baby it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you'll really see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there might be a time too,
when people want to experiment with it or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, where like they get to a point
where, um, you know, you might end up like
[SPEAKER_00]: if, especially if it's just for you,
you might end up like trimming some and
[SPEAKER_00]: then leave half the bag cured and super
nice in a cool spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go check on your weed a month later
and see if you like the weed in your jar
[SPEAKER_00]: better or see if you like the,
the, the flower you just broke off the
[SPEAKER_00]: branch and hold a joint with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know Bodie has this perfect room
or did at his house that was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: humidor and because where he lived is just
that perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's there's some weed in there from
like a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's all hanging and it's on the
branch and you know, like I've noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: even with seeds, like if they're stored in
their bud, they last longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a natural protection for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think there's a lot of
good aspects, even if you're just making
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and drying seeds, there's a lot of
good aspects to keeping it on the branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to bury our seed and in a 55
gallon drums and it would all be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't deseed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would store it, you know, on a dry
cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes great storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes great storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, they're not rubbing up
against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people don't know this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Caleb and I were just
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like that tiger stripe rubs off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thin layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an, it's more like a super thin,
tight fitting skin shell than it is like
[SPEAKER_00]: an embossed feature of a hard shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, people that start, people that
like hand harvest their seeds and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and they treat them really lightly,
they could end up getting all these dark
[SPEAKER_00]: tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start putting them through like a
blower and sifting them really nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all this extra work to make sure
people get perfect seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you could end up with
some pale seeds that were dark before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they lost their tiger stripe
because it just frictioned off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thin, almost transparent skin with
dark stripes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I watched it come off seeds
constantly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of us use blowers that make a
lot of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is I was actually
just talking the last few weeks to a
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican who was telling me about how they
store seeds and they can't bury them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They store them in big 55 gallon drums in
Jamaica and they store them basically
[SPEAKER_00]: either on bud or in the shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense, even in the shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it acts like a natural insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it protects it from the heat and it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd rather have a big drum full of
shake and seed than a big, or buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: seed than a big thing just full of seed
because it'll die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asked, is it a more indicated
trait, tiger stripes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed it a lot in Afghanis in
things, the bigger seeds that I see
[SPEAKER_01]: typically from Afghanis, but it's not a
general trait you can apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, a lot of the land race,
like Africans and Malawis, they tend to be
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller black seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also depends on what the mother was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your seeds are forming in some kind of
equatorial sativa, they're going to tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to be smaller because the flower clusters
and the calyxes they're forming in are
[SPEAKER_00]: also small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on when it's pollinated and
where on the plant it's pollinated,
[SPEAKER_01]: how big the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things that go into
factors, but like the tiger striping,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't see it a ton in traditional land
race narrow leaf plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an aspect where there was for a
long time, there was a misnomer among the
[SPEAKER_00]: community where if it wasn't tiger striped
enough, that means you didn't let it go to
[SPEAKER_00]: full maturity and you were trying to sell
young or immature seeds or you were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to cheat a bit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thing with seeds where people
are very visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have friends or whatever that won't
sell the pale ones even though they get
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy germ rates on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've kept a lot of lines off the
market that were just light or lost their
[SPEAKER_01]: stripes in the blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kept them off the market because
I knew it would be more of a pain in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ass to explain all that and teach every
single person then to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, color-coded seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Greenhouse's site on their
accomplishments, the color-coded seeds is
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to Greenhouse's site,
although I will say before I diss them too
[SPEAKER_00]: hard that when I was traveling in the 90s
to Holland a bunch, they had a great
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started talking shit about Greenhouse
and all of a sudden I was banned from the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's finish it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right there at the two hour mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept trying to join, but it kept telling
me to fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the deal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll cut me off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did enjoy my time going to Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did like it when Shanti and Neville sold
seeds and weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really appreciate what happened
after or whatever, but we covered a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just tried to give an idea of what your
thoughts could be on a multi stage
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to go over what it would look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding tech, random bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate everybody that's staying with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I got kicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
