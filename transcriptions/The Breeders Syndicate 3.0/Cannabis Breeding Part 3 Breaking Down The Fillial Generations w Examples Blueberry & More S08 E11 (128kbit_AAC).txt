[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_03]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_03]: Nazodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_03]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey everyone, welcome to Breeders'
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew here with my co-host
Thousandfold, and today we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: unlock and unfold some of the nomenclature
with some examples and hypotheticals on
[SPEAKER_03]: different strains to try to get people a
better idea past just the term F1 and F2
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that, and just brief ideas of what
it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, because last week we did a
fairly textbook overview of various
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts in breeding theory and science,
and so this week we're definitely getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely getting into some of the
actual real-life examples of breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: different real-life scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think one way we can begin is
we did talk briefly about, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: last week how it's rare to find a true F1
hybrid in cannabis, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we talked about how that Mendelian
model of true F1 hybrid and then F2gen
[SPEAKER_00]: with genotypic segregation doesn't happen
really in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Matt wanted to address some of
that, and we can start with the F1,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are examples of F1s in our world,
and how do you actually make them?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll start really with what they should
be and how they would be made in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: actual agricultural breeding versus
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the definition of an F1, we went over
that last week, it's crossing two
[SPEAKER_03]: distinctly different genotypes together,
essentially, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're crossing two stabilized
genotypes together is the idea,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, two distinctly different
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very, very key because in cannabis
it's used differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this idea, you would want to take a
Thai land race, something very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very long flowering Thai, for example,
or Burmese, or any of that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: and cross it to something traditionally
more Afghani that's interbred,
[SPEAKER_03]: or in this example, let's say any Afghani
will do, any Afghani will do from a land
[SPEAKER_03]: race region.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be a real F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by crossing those two inbred lines,
that's where you would get hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why when people talk about
hybrid vigor in cannabis, and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really necessarily apply because cannabis
is naturally vigorous anyways,
[SPEAKER_03]: and most of the things that we see in
cannabis are polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we see in cannabis when we see F1s
typically, and even I use this this way
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's how it's commonly understood
in trying to make it anything different,
[SPEAKER_03]: even by calling it a polyhybrid F1,
it would totally confuse everyone,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it does when you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As people understand it is that it is just
two different strains crossed to each
[SPEAKER_03]: other in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simply put, two different unrelated
strains, and in some cases even related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, and technically that is
correct to still call those F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just distinguishing that from the
true F1 hybrid type F1, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's commonly accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's even correct to call
it correct, but it's accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did look that up to be like...
For polyhybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still call it an F1?
[SPEAKER_00]: For like, yeah, heterozygous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or polyhybrids crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're still technically F1s,
but I... Okay, we'll just say that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not entirely sure, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's just because F1s have
to be two distinct genotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how they describe that for
heterozygous, since it's a major part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that F1 still designates the
filial generation as distinct from...
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so then it is... If that's the case,
then it's being used correctly in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so in this example, most people
would say like, OG kush crossed to
[SPEAKER_03]: purple-urple, whatever, if they're seed
lines, male, female seed lines,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would call that, an F1 in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: A great example of a real F1 in cannabis,
as I see it, would be something that CSI
[SPEAKER_03]: is currently working on, which is his Land
Race Burmese that was from Preservation
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, and crossing that to the Christmas
Tree Bud IVL line, which is... It is to
[SPEAKER_03]: the point of where if you pop seedlings
from it and you run clones of those
[SPEAKER_03]: seedlings, of each different seedling,
at the clonal level, they all look pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different when they're seedlings and
seedlings, as most people know,
[SPEAKER_03]: seedlings, like as they grow up and mature
and you take clones of them, they change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the clone is not usually the same
exact plant that this evening is,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in clonal form, they all seem to line
up pretty well, looking like clones of
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is, I think, an IVL by definition
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be a good example of a true
F1 hybrid in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to clarify, I think what we're
trying to point out is that when the term
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 is used, there are actually two
possible interpretations or meanings.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of that is the true F1 hybrid in the
Mendelian sense that Matt's trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is F1 in designating the
filial generation and nothing beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cannabis, most of the time it is the
latter, but there are exceptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the one Matt just gave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always exceptions to every rule on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In cannabis, it always finds a way to have
an exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about an F2?
[SPEAKER_03]: So F2 essentially is taking the progeny,
the resulting seeds or progeny of that F1
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid, popping those seeds, selecting a
male and a female or essentially a male
[SPEAKER_03]: and a female to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: A male and a female and crossing them
together, resulting in the F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second filial generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as it goes on to F3, F4, F5,
it's just that same process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each next generation select a male or a
female for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully you're selecting for traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're working them generations,
that usually helps take it a direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there good examples of F2s or like F2s
being used for particular reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an example of an F2 would be like with
the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got so few seeds of the F1 to pop that I
wanted to immediately do F2s of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was to open it up and see what's
actually in the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the perfect example of why you
would take something to an F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't necessarily want to open up
the whole thing per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like by doing an open pollination because
I already knew the direction I wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: go and they were already showing those
traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that helps make sense with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in F2s, like we've mentioned before,
that's where you're likely to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater proportion of recessives and
greater kind of variation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: permutations of genes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next one we want to move on to
was the S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are many, many,
many examples of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be specifically self.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people get this confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think all feminine seeds are S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas all S1s are feminized is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas vice versa is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an S1 means self.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when you take a essentially take a
clone of a single plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take two clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You reverse one using any number of
methods to cause it to show male flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pollinate another clone of itself and
harvest the resulting seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a self generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good examples of a self generation would
be like the Chem 91 S1s from CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: The heirloom Afghani S1s that I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially you do get to see the
recessives despite it being self.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people like to compare the S1
generation to the F2 generation because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're seeing the recessives.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you're still narrowing stuff down
while seeing the recessives in an S2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas in an F2, that's not necessarily
what's happening all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean S1, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: By S2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, that's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to say as well,
while you are also likely to find recesses
[SPEAKER_00]: in your S1s, you also have a chance of
finding things very much like the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: you're reversing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a chance to find things very
similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people understand it to mean that
you're going to find exact copies of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's definitely not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you'll find things very similar and
some may look identical, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it doesn't necessarily mean it's an
exact genetic copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's worth saying this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like any seeds that you make, regardless
of how you make them, you will never ever
[SPEAKER_00]: get genetically identical progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and it's like this with humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I impregnate myself, the resulting
babies don't look like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried this and it doesn't work very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggle to imagine what they would look
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful though.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, worth mentioning,
we have obviously addressed reversals and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just reversals, we've addressed
selfing quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to hear more about it,
definitely reference the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about selfing in both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next set of examples, the S2s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think, you know,
actually, as I gave an example for S1,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the Chem 91 S1s, more than likely
those are actually S2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I want to point that out too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think while it is a great example of
like a release of an S1, I probably should
[SPEAKER_03]: have referenced something like Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even, I was thinking Jesus S1s,
but that's probably an S2 too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, there's a lot of things out
there from clones that we buy as S1s that
[SPEAKER_03]: might be S2s, but because history hasn't
quite proven that out to be fleshed out
[SPEAKER_03]: like for sure, they're labeled as what we
know them to be, which would be the first
[SPEAKER_03]: true self generation that we can prove.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's in that case, they would be
referred to as S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in theory, some of that stuff is S2s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a good example, probably Chem 91,
because it's so uniform as an S1,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a good example of why it is probably an
S1.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't see a lot of real S2s being
released or sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I'm kind of stretching it a
bit to try to find something that really
[SPEAKER_03]: fits in right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a cool general point in
there though, which is that if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're starting with,
what your starting material actually is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what generation it actually is,
the best you get in cannabis land is a
[SPEAKER_00]: relative kind of designation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reboot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In not knowing what the Chem 91 actually
is, all we can say when you self is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is an S1, quote unquote.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in actuality, it may be an S2,
but you know, because we don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in reference to that, the blue bonnet
itself was supposed to be a blueberry pure
[SPEAKER_03]: line worked, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go by who had it, you know,
DJ Short, I think to Vic, or to Tony from
[SPEAKER_03]: SIGARMATHA, to Vic High, to Lone Star,
to me, that's a lot of general generations
[SPEAKER_03]: that were worked in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, DJ released it at F4 and
supposedly, you know, I mean, there's many
[SPEAKER_03]: generations in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really hard to say on that,
like what generation it really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming back to the S2s, has our old
mate Caleb done S2 work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's talked about it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he has, but it's not often released.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of hard to reference it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there's been several things he's
done and taken to S3 where the population
[SPEAKER_03]: of seeds seems to just be unviable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they don't pop at S3.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's always the case,
but it has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one is the F1R.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1R.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a designation that we use in
cannabis specifically, and it's only to
[SPEAKER_03]: denote reversal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when us as breeders, and like this
is not science talk now, this is like for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure our own nomenclature that we
instituted, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when breeders are looking at stuff,
we know if we're referencing, if I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at someone's writing, I know if
they're referencing a male in their line
[SPEAKER_03]: or if they're referencing a reversal in
their line by that designation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that we started doing so
that we know in each other's work what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're referring to if we're going to work
with each other's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully more people will institute
it over time because it's very helpful and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gets more and more important as
more people come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just as important as trying to
illustrate that you put the male second.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never put the male first.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always comes after the female.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even that isn't like strictly adhered
to that I see in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're trying to institute some
things to make it more easier to read or
[SPEAKER_03]: legible, scientifically legible for all of
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I mean, when you have a
consistent set of terms that makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually possible to communicate
effectively with other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In not having that, I mean, that's how we
got here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a messy state that we're in right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while what Matt's saying is true,
it's technically not part of, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mendelian science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still very important to designate in
the discourse of practitioners and the
[SPEAKER_00]: community of practitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is so different than a lot of
other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it's been kept out of the
science room for so long due to its
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal classification, a lot of us were
the ones trying to write this stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: understand it from the point of view of
people who are not collegiate,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but just trying to do the best
we can with what we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting is that runs headlong
into science and trying to adopt that and
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing how seeing if they even give a
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything we've done, which is not very
likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an uncommon thing,
you know, in other fields of practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially ones that are not science
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still very necessary to come up with
your own taxonomy instead of terms for the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and a good example of an F1R would be
when we had the sourdough and we reversed
[SPEAKER_03]: the diesel to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diesel and sourdough are not directly
related.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's it made for amazing
progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we find that that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rascal, O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rascal made his career making a lot of
like reverse hybrids, reverse feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the best earliest reverse
feminized hybrids were his.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern times, we have Canorado doing great
stuff with that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that F1Rs are very common,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially now.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BX or BC backcross.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did touch on this last week.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's essentially just taking trying to
think of how to word this best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do this one because I think I can
still remember it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of a backcross is you are
trying to bring in one stable trait into
[SPEAKER_00]: an already stable parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That parent is called the recurrent
parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one that you are backcrossing to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the introgressive parent,
which is the one that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: take that one trait from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an example of a backcross one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would be something like, let's see if we
could BX one to use as an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to keep using blue bonnet,
so I'm going to switch it up and go to our
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry cream was a line developed by
CVF, worked several generations,
[SPEAKER_03]: and was pretty close to breeding true,
especially with the clone we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when we outcrossed it, strawberry was
very dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the trait we wanted to lock
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that we happened to have been
growing Santa Cruz Blue Dream right next
[SPEAKER_03]: to it, and noticed that they were very
similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Santa Cruz Blue Dream was a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this point, I wanted to have a
regular seed line of strawberry cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And CVF had gone, taken a hiatus,
and I didn't have any regular seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took a male Johnny Blaze,
which was a blueberry Neville's haze,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is similar to the blueberry super
silver haze that was used for Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we outcrossed that, and then brought
it back to the strawberry, or that cross,
[SPEAKER_03]: we brought back to the strawberry cream
clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it produced consistent strawberry
turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be an example of an
effective backcross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final one that we wanted to touch
on for this warm up was an in-cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you breeding between two different
filial generations, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not dissimilar to a backcross in
many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: A backcross is an example of an in-cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, usually an in-cross is referred
to in cannabis specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is one of those,
the nomenclature from cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: referring to taking an F4 and crossing it
back to the F2 generation, a selection
[SPEAKER_03]: from the F4 generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's say you have traits you like
that are showing up in an F4 male,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you had an F2 female that you really
liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that case, you would use the F4 male
and the F2, and that would be considered
[SPEAKER_03]: an in-cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: An example of this, we had DJ Short's
blueberry seed line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had a selection from it that was
very blueberry, but very modern DJ Short's
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry, which to me means like the
butthole turps, like the nasty turps with
[SPEAKER_03]: slight berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But very beautiful to look at purple short
squat indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we crossed that to the blue bonnet,
which is, in my opinion, a hybrid of
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry, but very, very dominant for the
blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in doing this, my goal was to make
one that looked like DJ's modern line that
[SPEAKER_03]: had the smell of everything everybody
wants from blueberry and a much stronger
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to do that, I did what we
call an in-cross because that's the best
[SPEAKER_03]: way we could define it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since it was given to me as a pure
blueberry line, even though my suspicions
[SPEAKER_03]: are that the bonnet is not, because it was
given to me as that, I have to consider it
[SPEAKER_03]: an in-cross because I don't want to just
say that I know something that someone
[SPEAKER_03]: else is saying is incorrect, that I don't
have proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I press you to generalize and tell
us what are the overall benefits of using
[SPEAKER_00]: this method?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the overall benefits are if you're
not seeing certain traits pop up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you run a population of the F2
generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see anything in the males from
that generation that you necessarily like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've already taken things
generations out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in Hyatt Lowson's example,
or in his case, he has his Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he worked that to, I think,
F5, F6, and then didn't like necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: what he was seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he went back, popped more F2s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this point, if he doesn't find
anything in that F2 realm that he liked,
[SPEAKER_03]: he could have popped some of the F6,
looked for a male in there, showing the
[SPEAKER_03]: traits that he liked, and used that and
hoped that it bred like he liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've actually thought about
this that much, this particular strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that brings us to the end of this
little intro section, this little warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to add
on any of these, Matt?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to give a quick jaunt with
some examples, hypotheticals, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the next section,
we're going to take it one step further in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of examples and scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a bunch of questions from
the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to begin with Skrusten
Scarecrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got to keep a triangle choke
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in his words, it brought the best
traits from each of the parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy amount of high quality resin,
and a nice high from the TK, great
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry flavor from the bonnet,
G's will bring in great flower structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also augmenting the smell and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he doesn't want to use this keeper and
crosses yet as he's scared to lose that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular combination of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's thinking about is going
through more packs to find another similar
[SPEAKER_00]: individual to the keeper that he's got and
maybe doing a sibling cross or maybe an
[SPEAKER_00]: F2R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do we think about his proposed
approach if his goal is to produce more
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenous stock that represents his
keeper?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a few steps to this that I
would ask him first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would be, are you sure that this is
the ultimate expression from that line you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is it as extreme blueberry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it as potent?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it as resinous as you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen examples of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an amazing example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this case, knowing what his example
is, I'd say, go ahead, pop more seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, and if you don't see something
immediately in there that you think can be
[SPEAKER_03]: cloned and grown more and might compete or
be better, I would not do any of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would probably not cross it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would probably self it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you wanted to have a uniform
homogenous line of that specific
[SPEAKER_03]: expression, taking it through the
generation operations through regular
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds would be a little bit trickier
because you're going to have to pick a
[SPEAKER_03]: male that lines up with a lot of those
traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you're just going to be constantly,
constantly like taking a step back,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking two steps back, one step forward,
two steps back, one steps forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very easy to have that happen,
especially with a line that is a
[SPEAKER_03]: polyhybrid like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really recommend selfing for that
example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll take it more homogenous,
quicker in the direction he wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you won't have to pop as many.
[SPEAKER_03]: To really keep narrowing it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was also wondering if he did make
S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OK, let's say that he did pop out a
few more from these other packs that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did find another similar
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else he can do with that
to help this kind of homogenization or is
[SPEAKER_00]: that just not ultimately going to be
helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, could he self both and then cross
the S1s?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that do?
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I would recommend that is
if he found another one that, say,
[SPEAKER_03]: had such drastic potency, but was equal in
smell and resin production to the one that
[SPEAKER_03]: he was keeping, but it was drastically
more potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it was slightly less smelly than
the other one, but along the same lines
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe slightly less resinous,
but along the same lines, but close.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that case, I could understand crossing
the two to try to absorb one of the traits
[SPEAKER_03]: and not wear out the other two.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even that's still just.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're still risking just opening
it up again, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I would still probably just S1
the best of the two, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: or the best of the five or however many of
the keepers are very similar or what have
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got a follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is a bit broader.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's asking you in particular,
because obviously, you know the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's wondering, like, do you have a
sense of what would outcross well to his
[SPEAKER_00]: his triangle choke individual?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, yeah, having experience with the
parents and having actually sampled it,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there types that might play well with
it, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants that may not dominate,
but would still complement it well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is like a lot of the reason I was
doing some of the blueberry or the blue
[SPEAKER_03]: bonnet, like hybrid crosswork,
like where I was taking the blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_03]: skittles that we had made and crossing it
to the blue mac one that we made,
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing the punchy bluster to the silver
pearl blue bonnet, the cream that we made
[SPEAKER_03]: to try to see how those two cross
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every single time, it seems to be
moving forward that the blueberry turps
[SPEAKER_03]: very heavily, except for in the silver
pearl one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The silver pearl tended to dominate
mostly, but the berry still moves forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can still find them in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not as dominant as the silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said, like, I really think like
the first thing that comes to my mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you don't have any males that you like,
they immediately show all the traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, that's really hard to select
for and to know if you don't know the line
[SPEAKER_03]: real well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like the white bonnet complement
that real well because it'll keep the
[SPEAKER_03]: resin production, the potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the males from that, I've already
found males that are dominant for the
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry scent expression and flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that it can dominate the white.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that immediately come to mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that's bringing in more
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bringing in more outside genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're like if you're insisting on
having a regular seed line, I would either
[SPEAKER_03]: use the triangle choke male and really
hope for it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you're trying to drive in the
blueberry turps, which I know he really
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to do, I would use something like
another bonnet hybrid of the same line,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said, or something like the white
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I knew you had a white
bonnet, just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't really sell him much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just passed him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is more or less Kristen's
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you would recommend
or want to add to his set of parameters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other weird paths you could go down
for fun?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always try the male selection,
like I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend everybody do it because that's
the way you learn the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, like the selfing,
because I know his goal and what he wants
[SPEAKER_03]: to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to recommend him to do anything
else because I know exactly what he wants
[SPEAKER_03]: to get done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of all the stuff people have sent me in,
that's one of the ones that made me sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardcore put me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we can move on to our next
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's from Kyle Turrell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a pack of banana tires once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe before we go any further,
would you like to tell us what the banana
[SPEAKER_00]: tie is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the banana tie was a juicy fruit tie
that came from a local place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I picked it up, it was a local
club and I just thought there was no way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was no way that these
people would want to know what a tie was
[SPEAKER_03]: or what juicy fruit tie was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it did look very quote unquote sativa,
typically sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took it home and it was definitely a
tie dominant plant that had been worked
[SPEAKER_03]: probably my best guess would be sensey
seeds, type juicy fruit tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it smelled like juicy fruit gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be taken anywhere between 11 to
14 weeks, depending on where people take
[SPEAKER_03]: it, like where they like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was explosively speedy hide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not play around happy tie weed like
I assumed it would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the banana tie was that cross store
platinum banana OG VX1 there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continuing on with Kyle's question,
he's got two keepers of his banana tires
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: One keeper has a no ceiling high,
the juicy fruit smell and taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: but poor structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second keeper has better structure and
yield, tropical fruit and banana turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lower ceiling for the high,
which he doesn't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what he's hoping is to bring the
structure and yield from the second one
[SPEAKER_00]: into the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's thinking about, so that's
the goal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's thinking about doing is
reversing and then combining the two
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers in both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe also selfing each of them
to look through.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually a really good example,
I think of, of how to do that,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to, how to lock in both traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that line's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That line's a really tough one because it
uses, it incorporates banana OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've talked about banana OG a little
bit in the past on the show, but in banana
[SPEAKER_03]: OG, there are some beautifully banana
smelling stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some beautifully OG Kush smelling
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's combinations, both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's like the 60% ratio clip
of just blando, skunk one, just bland,
[SPEAKER_03]: bland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's got a decent high,
but it's just so bland and it's not really
[SPEAKER_03]: super appealing to anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not super resinous, super bland,
um, in the juicy fruit tie in the owl
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses, there is a lot of that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's low odor, um, low terp,
like just semi sweet plants in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're like that clone example,
just ripping and it has a beautiful smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that banana tie, I knew there would
be stuff that would be variant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew it'd have a, like what we talk
about a high ceiling, low floor,
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as what to expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily high, but what to expect
from the progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I ended up giving them away for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but then the demand got pretty big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we auctioned off a few after a few
years of it being out, but in the S ones,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, we use really good examples of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the S ones, it should be easy enough
to do like a sister crosses of the S ones
[SPEAKER_03]: and lock in some traits that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it'll also be interesting to see
how easy it will be or not to reverse some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these as well.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you just never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what's going to drop pollen
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should point out by the way,
that, uh, we did not, uh, manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: people into using Matt's work for any of
these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just, you know, from this,
like, we're all from the small community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, people are growing,
a lot of people growing Matt's work and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing some kind of like,
uh, underhanded marketing, although I
[SPEAKER_00]: think Matt will still take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, if you do a contest,
if people want to, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, um, organizing contests
online must be really difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hard, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like even doing like the small
giveaway contests, like on IG,
[SPEAKER_03]: we found that like, there was almost no
way to do it without a second person
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately complaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they want, like, we just never had it
happen without that happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like immediately we're in
kindergarten and like, ah, I was first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was first.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on my screen first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like herding cats.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even like, uh, even more
complicated, like the idea of like trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to run like a little like mini cup,
you know, and like getting samples sent
[SPEAKER_00]: around and just thinking about all the
different steps in the logistics and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much could go wrong at every step and like
not being able to guarantee like much
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I remember, um, one of the Adam
Duncups, one of my friends mailed in his
[SPEAKER_03]: example and it got, it got stuck at the
post office and we didn't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not have a clue why.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just knew that we had to go there and
pick it up at the post office and he had
[SPEAKER_03]: to present his ID to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember looking, I'm like,
are you going to do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as we pulled up the post office,
like, is it really worth it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're keeping it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned out they were keeping it because
it was like short, a dollar, like I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: postage, but like, it was one of the
things we're like, do you really think
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to give your fucking weed
back, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there's all kinds of things that
can go crazy with those competitions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that alone, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would, I wouldn't mind seeing
someone try, but I I'm not going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm going to get involved.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got another question from
scientist and this one, my apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've interpreted his question
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are quite a few moving parts to his
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his story is he was given some seeds a
few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a blueberry seeds from one of his
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe he said it was from the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's essentially wanting to extend his
buddy's blueberry work and see what kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of traits exist in this lineage that his
friend has been working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the way that he wants to learn
about them is by crossing them to other,
[SPEAKER_00]: other lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to his friend's nineties
blueberry seeds of unknown, relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown provenance, he's got a bonnet F2
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think according to what he's saying,
he has two different pre-98 bubba cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's also got some pea berry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he's trying to do, just to say
again, he wants to try them out in
[SPEAKER_00]: different combinations to learn more about
his buddy's blueberry that he was given.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his initial question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think what he's trying to ask is
like, do these crosses make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so with bonnet F2, what could he
possibly learn doing it this way?
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he listed a few different bubba clones,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he listed that he was growing bonnet
F2s as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonnet F2s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I think he said pea berry,
which is the Katsu bubba blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he said the pre-98 bubba blue
bonnet, which is the bubba kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can learn about all of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if he knows bubba really well,
those are excellent ways to figure out
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on with his homies blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, if it's related to DJ's blueberry
is a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, is it related to DJ's blue?
[SPEAKER_03]: Run it, run it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or run out a bunch of these, these blue
bonnet F2s.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if anything's lining up at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if there's any traits lining up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he knows bubba really well,
like finding those bubba blue bonnets are
[SPEAKER_03]: so stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Expression wise that like, they're a great
cross to out cross to anything to bring in
[SPEAKER_03]: potency and blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know sub Rob from San Diego's finest
cuts is it's one of his more favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: lines is the blubba kush for that reason,
for a male selection and breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I know I think it's a good way to
learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he knows bubba, those lines will
tell him more, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to clarify as well, I imagine
just to leave like no stone unturned,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine what he is going to do is
actually first run all those things out
[SPEAKER_00]: separately, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, he's not just going to like
immediately cross them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try to figure out what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that would be pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way is to run each of these packs,
lines, cuts out, look at them all
[SPEAKER_00]: separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe after that, you can try
like crossing some of them and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: passes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like those lines are great if he knows
bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, like it's really easy to pick out the
bubba traits from the blue bonnet ones to
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know bubba really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you sorry you may have
actually covered this, but his follow up
[SPEAKER_00]: was with the pea berry help or would it
just confuse things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And slow, slow things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: His goal is not to make seed for
production, but just learn about that
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything you want to say about the pea
berry in particular?
[SPEAKER_03]: The only difference between the pea berry
and like the pre-98 bubba from Shaw is
[SPEAKER_03]: that the pea berry, I think that that
Katsu bubba is a hybrid of bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is different than Bubbacoast
traditional.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is slightly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's, I mean, if you know the
Katsu cut, it's still very bubba-ish,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it has different, like the way the bud
formations are is different typically than
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubbacoast, but the turps are very
similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes from that coffee, chocolatey
coffee to the soapy cushy, depending on
[SPEAKER_03]: how you grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think both are really good directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubbacoast is so dominant in Katsu that,
you know, a lot of people would argue
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's a hybrid or not, but I'm
pretty sure it is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, he actually, I didn't see this,
but he actually had another point that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a wrench to this plan in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it was good that I skipped over
it, but now I've noticed he said he's
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to six flowering plants per run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how would you approach that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of do it in parts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In parts and keep a lot of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can relate, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything else you want to add to this
whole enterprise of like, or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: we've covered enough for us?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I just really like it because
like, um, one of the initial things that I
[SPEAKER_03]: was running with above a blue bonnets,
the white bonnets and a few others,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're basically Afghani dominant blue
bonnet crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that was where I wanted to initially
take a lot of the lines because itself
[SPEAKER_03]: bonded is very traditionally cushy Afghani
dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a good, it's a good partner for it
essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I like his idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other thing I like about this
question is that in some ways he's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually not really that concerned about
making seeds or, or, um, breeding per se
[SPEAKER_00]: in this one scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually just talking about wanting
to learn as much as possible, which we did
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about last week as being extremely
important and like, it's also extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: time consuming and resource intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is admirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that someone is like, yeah,
I'm not, I'm not actually about seed
[SPEAKER_00]: making right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just want to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's quite rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is, there is one thing I'll add to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just the, the one thing from the
past two shows that I've noticed in the
[SPEAKER_03]: comments that nobody, like maybe they
have, maybe I haven't communicated it
[SPEAKER_03]: well, but the playing, when I refer to
playing, which is crossing unknown to
[SPEAKER_03]: unknown or known to known and just seeing
what happens while I say that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, it is an, it is an essential
part to learning to breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, you can't really breed if you don't
know what you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in my opinion, and it is an essential
step, but it's not breeding proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're not doing necessarily having
goals with selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like not goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not an end goal here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just seeing what happens in
learning, but learning is a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a major step.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to discount that part as
part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a major part of it, but it's not
breeding proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can, I can paraphrase that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is that, um, the seeing what
shit sticks vibe is an important part of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, but breeding itself is not
reducible to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to make that clear because it
sounds like, like I'd see people's
[SPEAKER_03]: comments saying, no, it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I never said it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent most of my career doing that,
you know, like that's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, I mean, I can't shit on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, I think when people hear
someone, uh, putting conditions around
[SPEAKER_00]: something, um, it does like, uh,
some people can be quick to assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that they just shouldn't do it,
but that's not, that's often not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often what all we're just saying,
always saying is we're pointing out the
[SPEAKER_00]: limits of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there is never just like something is
outrightly good or outrightly bad or
[SPEAKER_00]: outrightly useful or outrightly not
useful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each, each thing, each technique,
each strategy has its own trade-offs and
[SPEAKER_00]: limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each strategy is good for looking at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I, we really need to get some not so
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If any of you guys out there get bored and
hear this, I want to make little MP3
[SPEAKER_03]: clippies is the best not so isms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll toss them up on the soundboard for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Community, please get on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did some.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had like another couple of hours,
I might've tried to get some, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else please do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few I want to grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we could also put his face on the
screen while we're playing those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could just make a not so mask and wear
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is made for Halloween.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make him one for me and I'll play
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make him do imitations of me and me of
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has brutal, brutal imitations of me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, I was actually going to say,
I didn't think not so was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: would, would be down, would is like the,
you know, that he could do impersonations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but that's cool to hear
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying they're accurate,
but it's more the things that he thinks I
[SPEAKER_03]: would say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a pretty, pretty good and open
one from quasi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually got a couple, but we'll
start with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, these are hypotheticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he, I assume that he's
thinking about this, but he's not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: started on anything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he says, so let's say he starts with a
pack of fem seeds and he has a few
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is CSI's big bad wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the Chem D N 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not mistaken, there's a TKS ones,
or he says one of the recent LA Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: headband hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with one of these,
what steps would you take to get a male
[SPEAKER_00]: with as many traits from the fem pack as
possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the follow up being, would the
starting fems change the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're all different from each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each step of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chem D Chem 91 would definitely be
different from, um, a TKS one selection
[SPEAKER_03]: since they are variant TKS ones is
selection would definitely matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some are creamy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are not like OG Kush at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are very OG Kush type, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and what was the last one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was one of the recent LA Kush
headband crosses from not so in CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mostly like diesel, super skunk type
hybrids were in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them though, some were like bubble
gum and bubble Kush or Mendo perps that
[SPEAKER_03]: were very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really does depend on what the
starting material is before we can dive
[SPEAKER_03]: into the males.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's assume, let's assume he's,
um, wanted to do diesel types,
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or actually, no, let's go Chem just
because he went with Chem 91 Chem D is the
[SPEAKER_03]: first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And assume he wants to go for Chem,
uh, types.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, where would he go for a male for
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it just depends on the area
you're from and the stuff you have access
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would immediately for any kind of
regular Chem breeding hybrid, I would
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately think of, uh, mad elite's work
with the, uh, um, the, the Chem 91 Chem D
[SPEAKER_03]: I-95 specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just so heads and tails above any
other regular Chem work done by me,
[SPEAKER_03]: done by anyone else that I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just so precise to Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how he did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was just really lucky and good,
not just lucky, but it was, he knows
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem's really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of it was luck, but it was good
selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they had Legend OG in there,
had Stardog, had Triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had all that stuff in the I-95 and then
you add in Chem 91 and Chem D,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are two different plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but knowing that and knowing that it's
very Chem 91 dominant, I would definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: advise Quasia to probably track something
down similar to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's tracking down Chem stuff takes
knowing really reliable sources of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's only a few people I trust on
earth with Chem stuff to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: To know that they don't have fake cuts,
to know that they never got fake cutted,
[SPEAKER_03]: any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's only a few people that I trust
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to throw people under the
bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to name all of them,
but I really like mad elite stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, that work of his is
pretty pervasive now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still see it used quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we, he never sold it ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: He let people have it and he and if they
were doing auctions for like charities or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, if they were his home,
he's doing auctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would toss them in and he gave me a
bunch to like sell and toss and toss in
[SPEAKER_03]: for freebies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so they've made it out there,
but like not everybody picked them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, I mean, people use them,
but they're not as pervasive as they once
[SPEAKER_03]: were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, uh, I know dynasty uses it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use it and that's about it that I know
of right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for fun and for the sake of it,
would you, would you be keen to then now
[SPEAKER_00]: move to like, say he signed with the TKS
ones and think about what mail would work
[SPEAKER_00]: for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of wedding cake stuff pops up in
that, um, TKS ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say wedding cake type stuff,
that means stuff that is like kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: creamy may turps to me and just very
resinous, very productive, very dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can find that in, let's see what's
a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bodie's, um, love triangle is a good
example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That triangle ADA G 13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people thought that the G 13
hash plant was too dominant in it for a,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, triangle Kush tight back cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a great one, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep the, um, maybe hopefully help
with the wedding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it'll help with the
wedding cake turps, but, but it might,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you weren't joking when you said you
could just do this off the top of your
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it for so long on Instagram every
night for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing free consultations with
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Free always, always free.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how about now starting with the LA
let's assume it's going to be a diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: type cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know what the sort of wrench in
that let's do, let's not do a diesel type
[SPEAKER_03]: cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do, well, I know, you know what?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a diesel type cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that shit's going to be so dominant
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it wouldn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, let's do like Mendo
perps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like bubble gum maybe, but I don't
think that's going to necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: dominate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of the bubble gum when it
does, it's just earthy and not full gum
[SPEAKER_03]: smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, diesel let's do diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, diesel is a hard one because
there's still a few people I would trust
[SPEAKER_03]: to know diesels, um, for regular diesel
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I can think of them
easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not blue bonnet related or blue
bonnet adjacent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying to think of other people
who make regular seed lines of diesel that
[SPEAKER_03]: I would highly recommend that I know for
sure are using good diesels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I know Chaco's, um, let some of his
sour crosses out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm sure there's some, it just really
takes a lot of research and I don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to throw anyone under the bus and then
there's certain people I would recommend
[SPEAKER_03]: that just don't deserve it because they've
been pricks lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about this, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you didn't have to find another,
what if you couldn't, let's just say you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't find a diesel male or diesel type
kind of regular line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other line would you go to if you
could?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I would recommend super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So look for like a diesel regular seed
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there are those out there,
um, from other people besides myself and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not too super rare to find,
just avoid, um, anyone with four 20 in
[SPEAKER_03]: their username because usually those
people will have fake diesel cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be clear, cause Matt's being a
bit, um, Matt's being a bit coy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he, Matt has a bunch of like regular
diesel crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, other people do too,
but yeah, there there's definitely out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an excellent super skunk type and
sours a super skunk and diesel is more
[SPEAKER_03]: like more like diesel than it is like a
chem in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within, I guess, within, within this,
uh, project, like in terms of steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, are there any particular kinds
of steps you would recommend him taking
[SPEAKER_00]: or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, since it's all regular
reading, I would really recommend,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, that crossing one time for the trait
that he wants and then working it forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick a trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with the trait, you know,
pick a trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can't have it all sometime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I shouldn't say you can't have it
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you get it all very rarely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get it all, but sometimes you get
managing your expectations, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, that did throw me a bit when he
said, um, what did he say?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, uh, with as many traits from the
FEM pack as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's an interesting qualifier for
me where I'm like, Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sometimes you get good breeding
work done in the pack that you receive,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the blue bonnet was red to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, CSI does great work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you'll get, you know,
it'll be that easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, lots of times it's pick a trait and
stick with one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's, that's the best you could
hope for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a difference between
something unlikely occurring and you
[SPEAKER_00]: planning your process relative to what is
likely to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if you are planning your process
likely to what is planning your process
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to what is likely, then you
should try to focus on like a single
[SPEAKER_00]: trait, um, at each step, because you're,
you're, you're reducing the odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sorry, you're, you're helping your
odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had a point of that last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a really, really skewed
understanding of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: How it worked, how traits work,
what a phenotype was all that coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have anybody to teach me
specifics on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really, like, I didn't go to
college for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't pay attention in high school to
botany.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't care like about any of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to learn as it went.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, none of that stuff comes
common sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one thing we've been trying
to drive home is like Murphy's law plays
[SPEAKER_03]: out heavy sometimes, you know,
expect the worst to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I ran into a lot of Murphy's law
on my way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean everybody does,
but I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I always like have these
qualifiers of like, you know, this is that
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to get the worst case scenario,
what to expect, because sometimes that's
[SPEAKER_03]: just how it plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I felt like in some ways,
and I know I'm being uncharitable about
[SPEAKER_00]: our content, but in some ways I saw last
week's episode as just an extended fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: disclaimer, you know, in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's inaccurate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of this kind of thinking is
not intuitive, as you're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: like people becoming accustomed to how you
deal with probabilistic outcomes that may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using terms like low floor, high ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are terms that you use around
probability and how you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: probability.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you are dealing with probability,
it's not enough to just say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yes, any of these outcomes are
possible, but it doesn't mean that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are probable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it happened for you once
doesn't mean that it's repeatable and that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might just have been extremely,
extremely lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the chat yesterday in Discord and
in the voice chat, people were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about their positive experiences with Paul
and Chucking like in the open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not hitting random branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I can do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing big.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, just because you were able
to do it in the tent that one time doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: mean that you should make that a habit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I promise it won't happen that way
every time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you and I, we're chatting a bit
about gaming, which I don't think we've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever done before, before we started
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of comes to mind for me in the
world of games as well, where you might
[SPEAKER_00]: make a ridiculous move that works for you
that one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it a hundred times,
it might work like three or four times or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something, some kind of terrible
success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a difference between something
being reliable and repeatable and
[SPEAKER_00]: something that just worked for you just
because it worked for you that one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually a really good way of
saying it and illustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like sometimes I play games and
the it's like playing with like actual
[SPEAKER_00]: kids and they annoy the shit out of me
and, and they do something stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you shouldn't have done
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're like, but it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, yeah, but, uh, you know,
and then I give up and then they walk
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and get hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're telling me to go touch
grass or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, I'm old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you deal with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like cuss, I cuss so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to be like, you don't have a
full brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just forget about what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can come back to quasi his second
question, which is also quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so his hypothetical scenario is
finding a plant that has some really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he specified like, you know,
low concentration, high impact scent
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, but essentially he's saying
he's found if he finds something with a
[SPEAKER_00]: unique scent that he's, I don't know if
he's guessing as a recessive trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if he's maybe discovered that it's
recessive or has a premonition that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that, that scent is otherwise
getting lost in the overall, like nose of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it doesn't translate to flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would he go about breeding to make
that rare scent component more prominent
[SPEAKER_00]: in the overall nose and translate better
to flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he says it's fine to bring in other
specific flavors, as long as the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: package is high flavor and that the
original recessive scent component,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that he was talking about at the
beginning, um, comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it seems like a, I think
nailing both of those things seems really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even just talking about how you try
to get that one, draw that one sense out
[SPEAKER_00]: is maybe enough for one part of this
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like for me, the, when he says like a
high impact, low.
[SPEAKER_00]: A current or whatever low concentration
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like something like a volatile salt
compound or something that's, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: dissipates pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say roadkill?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, never.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think that's what he's referring to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's probably the example I'll go
to on how I tried to do it a few different
[SPEAKER_03]: ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we had two, what I think are super
skunk adjacent lines in, uh, like diesel
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the heirloom Afghani,
which had a lot of, um, typically more
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa expressions, but it is mostly
Afghani and structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we were told it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it played out that way, but what most
people like, it was more narrowly from
[SPEAKER_03]: some expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think people would typically classify
that as sativa, but I don't see it as
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think it has super skunk in it or
something like that or similar type of
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I tried doing S ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had a very, very high volatile soft
compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like you could just smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was just wild, wild strong in that
outcross is what we saw or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the self line, what we saw was a lot of
variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we saw a lot of variation in
expression being that it was, it would go
[SPEAKER_03]: from, cause when you would smell it,
the, the, the combination of all those
[SPEAKER_03]: smells smelled kind of skunky,
but like individually, it would be a
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of like ammonia piss,
you know, um, burnt rubber tennis ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then whatever that component is in
diesel that is skunk, whatever that
[SPEAKER_03]: component is that, that you would describe
as that in super skunk and diesel and that
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of type or sour even, um,
it had that, but in those three
[SPEAKER_03]: combinations together, it just smells
loud, like loud, like burn your eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we saw like each of those
individual expressions laid out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd see stuff that was just pissing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd see stuff that was just, uh,
burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd see stuff that was more like savory
skunk, but it was really hard to nail the
[SPEAKER_03]: trifecta of all three in a, in a very
potent form, like the initial mom was
[SPEAKER_03]: super hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I tried that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, at another location,
we were doing a diesel cross to a,
[SPEAKER_03]: or I'm sorry, a sour dub cross to a
reverse diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in doing this, I was testing the super
skunk, the theory that like, if we double
[SPEAKER_03]: up on the super skunk being that sour dub
has super skunk in it by the sour and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, uh, sort of diesel and then diesel has
super skunk in it, probably being a super
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk soft line, uh, accidental bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I found was that more
consistently the skunk spray chem seemed
[SPEAKER_03]: to, and that was the name of the line,
um, directed toward the, the sour dub,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, diesel seemed to go more towards
keeping it consistently in that super
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk savory buttery skunk range and not
veering away from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the heirloom Afghani S1 would go
the pissy range and more of the burnt
[SPEAKER_03]: tennis ball range, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how I did it, um, in approaching
that project in a similar method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now moving Terps into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is really hard initially, like when I
think of bringing in any kind of Terps to
[SPEAKER_03]: things like extracts, I immediately think
of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like that turpentine to me has
turned up the volume on most fruity
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors, berry flavors, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know that turpentine,
turpentine would necessarily be a great
[SPEAKER_03]: driver of skunky stuff, but it definitely
helped in the Fairfax four way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no reason that it couldn't help
with this and actually translate it to
[SPEAKER_03]: even more fluid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but trippinolene is known to dominate
so heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd get a lot of stuff that was only
trippinolene with no volatile skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: compound or sulfur compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it would take a large pop or a
lot of luck to find, but that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be my first thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think from a theoretical point of
view, like, uh, like you were saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: it obviously depends a lot on whether or
not, uh, in reality, this is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to combine, um, a few different
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or if it, you know, from say like a
Mendelian perspective, it literally is a
[SPEAKER_00]: single trait that's recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then technically again, from a theoretical
point of view, if it's a single trait that
[SPEAKER_00]: is recessive, you need to find out the
plant that also has that trait that is
[SPEAKER_00]: also recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way you will see much of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Double recessive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one of the theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think Matt did a better explanation
of actually practically how you would try
[SPEAKER_00]: to approach it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, and, but by doing it and
everything we've done, and also Caleb with
[SPEAKER_03]: the big bad wolf and other, um,
other of these chem and super skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids, we're kind of figuring out,
yeah, it seems like that, that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that smell in the super skunk lines seems
to be a double recessive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be recessive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you, when you do the super,
what we call the super stunt double up
[SPEAKER_03]: technically is it, it seems like it is a
double recessive and locking it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why when you do it,
it consistently shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one will be very interesting
to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I actually had a last minute
edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't think I got to go over this
one with you, Matt, but I think it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's from Dude-ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's got a male sour diesel unknown
provenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sour diesel, quote unquote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he describes it as being, uh,
well-structured, sturdy, vigorous,
[SPEAKER_00]: good gassy stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that he doesn't actually know
he's not, he's not run progeny out from it
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just qualify that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's also got, he's doing stem rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't specify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we can make some assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even assume no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing stem rubs, you don't even
smell the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so he's also got two female keepers of
limelight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that is, key lime pie, um,
by MBBK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as familiar with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he says that they don't have the
greatest frame, but they grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell good, pine, skunk, hint of
lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately what he's trying to
achieve, he wants to put a studio frame on
[SPEAKER_00]: the limelight and maybe add a bit more gas
to the backend, maybe maintaining or
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made the first cross already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has made a cross and he's about to run
through the first generation to dig
[SPEAKER_00]: through to see what's being passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the questions he's got, if I find a
male or female keeper in the F1 pop,
[SPEAKER_00]: should I go to F2 as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or should I just try, or what would be
the best course to try and lock in those
[SPEAKER_00]: like, um, traits that he wants in the
cross?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so structure is one of the easiest
things to breed for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, hemp is very,
it has great structure and that's like
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and it's real or it's state,
it's natural state to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, so that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, and, and when he says it's sour
diesel with great structure, I immediately
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's not sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's not, and I think he's kind of
aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's saying that like,
you know, that's what he's calling it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, and that's typical though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not even a crack on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's, that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you going to know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I guess maybe his male,
he wasn't able to get much more than stem
[SPEAKER_03]: rubs off of the smell, which also can
happen with males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if he's run through the progeny and he
sees what he likes, I mean, I S1 it,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no reason to F2 it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've already got everything you'd
like with the structure and the progeny,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, unless you think it's not quite good
enough and it's not keeper enough for your
[SPEAKER_03]: case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you think there's something better
in there, then of course you can F2 it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, again, so I think this one to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that his extended
question was basically like, I thought you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have already answered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's basically saying, yeah, how far down
the generation should I go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And should I like consider back crossing
as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, like I said, people have this
want to like work a line or think that
[SPEAKER_03]: they need to work a line, but it,
it, if you you've already found what you
[SPEAKER_03]: like, there's really nothing else to do
with S1 unless you really want a regular
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a huge point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to keep working it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to, you don't need to keep
looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you found like your ultimate keeper
that you like, like it nails all the
[SPEAKER_03]: boxes, bam, bam, bam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always, like I said, explore,
look through the rest and be sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there is something way better that
you didn't even know existed, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, ultimately when you find that one that
is a keeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless your goal is to have like just a
bunch of regular seeds backed up for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, then I just don't know any reason to
do anything other than S1 or self it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a paraphrase of this is work forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have what you are looking for,
then it is less, less reasonable to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, why?
Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a learning point of view,
maybe, but otherwise, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, when I see BX six or BX 12 or F
12, like, if you're doing real selections
[SPEAKER_03]: on this stuff, you should be able to lock
it in and foremost, like at least the
[SPEAKER_03]: trait that you want or multiple traits.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say crazy as shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people be making seeds for two years
and say they're at F 12 and you're just
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at them like, ah, ah, ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I, dude, I was watching, um,
I was watching a BBC documentary on the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of apples in Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll say, first of all, it was the
fucking most British thing I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it sounds like it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was, it was actually really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they were talking about what it
actually took to develop some of their new
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, they literally were taking
like a decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause sometimes they're doing,
um, they're, they're waiting for sport
[SPEAKER_03]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is like a clonal mutation on a
branch to pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's that, that's just waiting on
luck and nature to take its course and
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it, that doesn't, it's a random
occurrence, you know, like, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: my favorite apples are what do you call
them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosmic crunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're called, and they're a,
um, or cosmic crisp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosmic crisp apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are a sport mutation off of the
honey crisp apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I first got them, I was like,
fuck off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just get the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that that's not quite how it works
in apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just a can of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I looked it up and yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pop those seeds, you may get
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sport mutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not going to occur at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still rely very much on, um,
on clones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actually I'll say this,
I think it was, it kind of blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the one part that wasn't
expecting at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They breed root stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh yeah, they will, they will have
separate kinds of root stocks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: grasp things onto them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just didn't somehow, I mean,
I knew this was a thing I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing, but I was just kind of blown
away by the idea that like, they basically
[SPEAKER_00]: have like a cloned root stock that they
will use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it brings the consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually wonder what that would mean in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm not, we do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like OG cushions have really, really weak
root structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was doing this the other day?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to someone I was talking to
is doing this the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Oh, I know exactly who it was farmer
Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but he's been working on it with,
with some of their stock and, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, OGs have really weak root structures
and they're known for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you graph that onto something like a
bubble, it has like really that root
[SPEAKER_03]: structure, like any, any plant,
a fucking hip cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, you're fucking solid, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pound it out with some OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it reminded me of another,
like quite one of those, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, one of those weird, like peripheral
projects that you get to see on the
[SPEAKER_00]: forums, um, where it was like basically
like root stock with multiple graphs from
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple different individuals,
like onto the one mother kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: weird Hydra type plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always have those Emerald cut bro,
like the blue dream with OG on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like fucking like nine other clones
grafted onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like bizarre novelty plants,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I wanted to buy an apple one
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a three in one apple plant or
tree that they were selling at Home Depot
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think I like, I assume it was
grafted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they also they doing three in one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apple trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, like, but it was funny because
like I'd see some of them that would like
[SPEAKER_03]: look smaller than the others and not be as
branchy and they would, they would be
[SPEAKER_03]: advertised as three in one, but there
would only be two tags showing that like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so one of the branches got knocked off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the whole other graph,
but they still wanted the same price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously it's Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the, going back to the,
the, the kind of, uh, Hydra Hydra,
[SPEAKER_00]: like multi, multi branch, multi individual
graph thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you were like, you live in a
prohibition country like me or under
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition conditions and like,
maybe it would be a very ambitious kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mother project where you technically would
be, have one mother plant, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually many plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's, that's, that's a,
that's a solution to a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, um, you can't keep many mothers,
keep a monster mom, Hydra mom,
[SPEAKER_03]: monster mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone in the discord who's keen,
please do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, my friend, racer X who,
um, used to be one of my, like maybe still
[SPEAKER_03]: around, but like, he was really integral
in our company early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he would do amazing, like graph branch
breath, like grafting, like monster
[SPEAKER_03]: branches on like tree grafting branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he would do like monster clones,
like six foot clones, just to see if he
[SPEAKER_03]: could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like air pruning, which is where,
you know, you've moistened part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: branch and like kind of a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So roots come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would like grow into the soil on
its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he'd have these, he had great
pictures of doing all this stuff back in
[SPEAKER_03]: the day, but I haven't seen it done in a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, I guess the broad,
I mean, I know this was just like a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: tangent, but I guess a broad, a broad
learning from this for me is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't hesitate to look outside of cannabis
for examples, for information,
[SPEAKER_00]: for inspiration, because like I pointed
out last week, the information space in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is basically like ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, I mean, apart from us,
of course we're perfect, but, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, otherwise, if you want to learn about
breeding, definitely like look at other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, like, you know, human civilization
has had thousands of years of history of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no reason why we can't learn
from other types of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, but one thing I've also learned
is, um, that like in scientific data
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically, when they are trying to
apply say hops or hemp to drug type
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, they often do that and don't
qualify that, or people don't understand
[SPEAKER_03]: that it really is qualified as another
type of this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I mean, it can work backwards to
where like you over-qualify it with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis where it doesn't necessarily
apply, but you should always look outside
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis always.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many outside of the box things
that you can bring from other agriculture
[SPEAKER_03]: into cannabis that will apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you remember not everything always
applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a speculative thing,
not like, uh, you can definitely just
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in anything wholesale and assume
it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading a paper the other day and,
and this is something that I experienced
[SPEAKER_03]: myself in reversing like large populations
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but they found that hemp reversed
relatively well compared to drug type
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consistently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though they are the same plant,
because one has elevated THC drug levels,
[SPEAKER_03]: for whatever reason, it is much harder to
reverse than like the CBD type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, coming back, I think this is the,
this is actually a follow-up to Dude's
[SPEAKER_00]: question and it's probably the last
question we'll get to for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in terms of breeding scenarios,
we have a couple of like miscellaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also answer at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude-ness, uh, his follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to try to reverse the sour diesel
male, quote, the quote unquote sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: male to possibly get a nice female
individual to pair with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once self, how many crosses of the progeny
would be ideal to get a decent look into
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, first of all, like what is the
benefit of reversing the sour diesel male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I don't know much about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you can speak to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in reversing males, you use a different
chemical than you would for reversing the
[SPEAKER_03]: females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we're not blocking ethylene.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to get it to, you know,
have a lot of ethylene in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when you reverse a male, just like
when you reverse a female, you don't just
[SPEAKER_03]: get a perfect male version of a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a male parts on a female bud
structure vice versa on a male,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get female parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a male bud structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while you can make seeds with this,
not all seeds are viable done this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and also you're not getting a full
male line either.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting a regular seed line when
you do male reversals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's two things to understand there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you want to understand what's
in your mail, I, it's definitely worth a
[SPEAKER_03]: shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely do it worth a shot to see
what's in the genetics of this male you
[SPEAKER_03]: have, you know, if you think it's our
reverse him and.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to make the seeds, see if they're
viable, give them a pop and see what's in
[SPEAKER_03]: the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, it's, it's doable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean that it's going to be
remotely easy or it's always going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: viable, but it's definitely doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the rest of the question is
quite similar to the previous one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like, if he does do this,
um, how far should he take working the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it just comes back to what we
said earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on what you find when.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what your goal is, um, which yeah,
he didn't specify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think maybe then our response is
mostly about the male reversal and what,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and you can use things like
ethyphon, um, floral do no reversals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else interesting to say
about male reversals?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most people do it not to make,
most people do it not to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do it to see what the terpene
profile, like to make the male produce
[SPEAKER_03]: more essential oils or oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could, so you can see what kind of
traits maybe it might be passing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, Oh, I can identify this as
the male trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I smelled that in the male,
uh, the resin glands on the male that we
[SPEAKER_03]: did on the reverse male, I can smell that
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that wasn't in the female.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that's coming from the male side
or it's most likely coming from the male
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that helps in some scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I have my own question about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's say you, you had, you know,
your blue bonnet male, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: now almost like mythical blue bonnet male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you have, so technically you could
have reversed that on, like you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: self that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, would that have been probably
something similar to a F if I know in the
[SPEAKER_03]: line, it probably would have been
something similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar to what I'm seeing in the blue
bonnet, the X1 or the F2 is realistically,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause it's already so uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it, it just really didn't really
serve a purpose in that sense,
[SPEAKER_03]: in that scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That clarifies it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think those are the scenarios
that we have for this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I, I'm not assuming, sorry,
I'm, I'm, I'm assuming that we will have
[SPEAKER_00]: more episodes if people have more
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people have more scenarios to suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people still do, please keep sending
them to me in the, on, in the discord,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the, in the content suggestions channel
for future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, man, I haven't really
decided like how long this breeding series
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just playing it by ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing it by ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we've covered all the breeding
scenario suggestions we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, was there anything you want to add
at this kind of like wrap up of this
[SPEAKER_00]: section?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I think what I can say is that I
can tell you that the vibe for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this week's episode is so different from
our very academic vibe last week and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: already enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I didn't agree last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just more, um, I think more brain
power involved in last week's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it was just more heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely was for me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice to kind of have that now as
something we can reference and like point
[SPEAKER_00]: to, but I'm also glad we did it and that
we have done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad we did it too, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not over yet, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wonder, I wonder if MC Whiteout liked
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whispering that into his face right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that in my cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that awesome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can wrap up with a couple of quite
interesting questions about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are about breeding, but they're also
more about like the supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So McMuffin, for example, kind of wants to
know like how different breeders stay
[SPEAKER_00]: organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he specifically had a mention of
like notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether there's like, you know,
you've developed your own like shorthand
[SPEAKER_00]: for things, you know, I know that you
might have some stories from yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: from like maybe CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's organization like as like a
commercial breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like me and CSI are the perfect,
like polar opposites on organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I didn't really understand this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've seen like, you know,
people talk about taking notes and
[SPEAKER_03]: notations and stuff, but I didn't really
understand how organized someone could be
[SPEAKER_03]: when it came to breeding and tell,
like, he started showing me like his
[SPEAKER_03]: paperwork on like when he would go through
and do testing on different things,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like I'd watch it was just so
detailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is so detailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you know, like has
everything written down, cataloged
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures, cataloged, like, and when it
came to me, I am the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my organization, my organization,
my life is just chaos, pure fricking
[SPEAKER_03]: chaos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have never written anything down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's been in my head and like,
I always kind of use the reasoning that
[SPEAKER_03]: like, well, if anything ever happens,
like, I don't want to have anything out
[SPEAKER_03]: there to, you know, be incriminating or
anything crazy, but like, in the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: it really was just me being lazy because
like, I'm just not organized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've tried doing it in my head,
which it worked for a long, long,
[SPEAKER_03]: long time until now when I'm getting older
and like, I'm not, I don't want to say I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: getting older, like, you know,
like other people, but like I'm further in
[SPEAKER_03]: my career and it's getting harder to
remember a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really getting hard to remember
certain details.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see why he does what he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying to incorporate it more in
my life now too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this last round of the punchy stuff
took better notes, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was because of what I had learned
from him, but yeah, he's a, he's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely a good mentor to have when it
comes to how to take notes and notations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he does have somewhat of a short hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually by tag number, by look,
smell, taste, eye, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: detailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very detailed because you want to be
able to reference all those fine nuances
[SPEAKER_03]: and anything that can be construed or bred
with as a trait you want to write down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not always readily apparent
early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that I did use to do when I
was super interested in breeding purples
[SPEAKER_03]: is that I took notes on all the tags and I
would always write down the color of the
[SPEAKER_03]: covalent or however you say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd always take, take notes on whether
they were purple green to start with,
[SPEAKER_03]: to see if there was any correlation to
that and flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I, that was the first notes I'd
ever taken on anything just cause I was
[SPEAKER_03]: interested, but I can continue that
terribly long, too far in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, for me as like someone who
comes from like, you know, information
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and like, and all that,
like I'd be, I'd have spreadsheets have
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking database.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, I'd be going hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe man, we can collaborate on
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that you're going to know me,
do you see why like I, my personality is
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I've never kept shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't like I'm so scrambled with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I feel like for you to
have the kind of recall that you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you must have internally some,
some kind of like, yeah, internal
[SPEAKER_00]: structure that your brain is using to,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious to know what, how that
might be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I've tried to stop doing it,
but like on the live feeds, I would do a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot where I have to like, when I think of
something, I'd close my eyes real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I go to my file system and my brain
that I've tried like visually doing and
[SPEAKER_03]: accessing it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I got a lot of brain fog now,
so I don't, it's not as easy to do that
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be very visual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was very visual and quick to,
and now I can't really do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot that isn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were doing some kind of like a
little bit of that, like memory palace
[SPEAKER_00]: type, type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard of that where you, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never been able to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think, but I think it's my form of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone has like some structure
in their brains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see screenshots, screenshots,
but they're not even visual screenshots.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just, I just think about it and it
just places, it's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even visual representations of
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I just close my eyes and pull it out
my ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, but somehow it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll go and like build some little
thing for this, for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can easily see like a,
a very, very simple, like breeders notes
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tool, which is not far beyond like
a spreadsheet, but you know, maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not far beyond what you've done with
the Codex, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not either.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see like a, I mean, I did say this
to you as well that the Codex,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though currently it was intended for
historical plants and projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no reason why you can't use it to
design projects either or track your
[SPEAKER_00]: actual projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely something for us to think
about for the future.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of related.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still to me about like information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, it's, it's one that many people
have asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's this one's from humble FC in
particular, but my friend, Bud Goodman was
[SPEAKER_00]: also asking me about this, which is
clarifying some of the terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just say this off the top of my
head, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got cultivars varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got individuals in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually not, to me, some of this
stuff is still really blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is not, for example,
like I think I can immediately say that a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype does not designate an individual
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a particular expression of a single
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what a phenotype is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, what about stuff like,
what is your understanding of like
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar or variety?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I've always understood like
cultivar as a cultivated variety in that,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the simple definition is a plant
variety that has been produced in
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation by selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of this to me, is very hard to
call a cultivar by the most stringent
[SPEAKER_03]: standards of the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I'm not anal about a lot,
but some like verbiage I'm super anal
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to call a lot of these things
cultivars, but some might be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most like most cultivars are done with
like root and stem cuttings, cell
[SPEAKER_03]: division, grafting, like careful selective
seed production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's a very, very specific
qualifier for a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specific, selected, carefully selected
seed selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some things I think would qualify and
others wouldn't from cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about everyone's favorite strain,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think we can immediately say,
for example, Chemdog 91 is not a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anything actually a strain,
like in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know, okay, from a technical point
of view, I know that like strains are used
[SPEAKER_00]: for like viruses in a technical sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for in cannabis land, people use it as
just like a catchall term for like
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that has a name almost,
whether that's like a, like a cross or an
[SPEAKER_00]: actual individual keeper, people still
just freely select.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that's a strain or like that's a
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, so there's a few different
definitions of strains out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most people when they refer to
strains are referring to like diseases,
[SPEAKER_03]: viruses, or like strains of endomycorrhiza
or bacteria, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is also a definition of a strain
and it's, and it's in connection with,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just, I'm trying to think of the word
a plant that has been modified through
[SPEAKER_03]: selective breeding or through breeding,
not say selective breeding, through
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it applies in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually does apply and is correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: While strain seems to apply to most things
because it doesn't necessarily specify
[SPEAKER_03]: careful, super controlled selective
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just says done with selective breeding
and that can be many different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That can mean many different things to
many different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it more applies overall than
cultivar does specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure people will be arguing till
they're blue in the face on that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, that's my take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say this from the point of view of
like the English language at large and
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's used in different practices and
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because one term is used in one field
doesn't mean you can assume that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct definition in every field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many fields that use the same
terms in very different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you've heard the term
strain in like virology or I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I don't actually know what those
things are called, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because you've heard that term used
in another technical context doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's the only meaning that it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that goes back to what you were
saying about strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of like separating an individual
plant from a line, you know, what would
[SPEAKER_00]: you say about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, you know, in a cross you'd see
like this parent by that parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like that's obviously an individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily represent the
entire line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I say expression, I, it could be,
I use it very loosely when I say
[SPEAKER_03]: expression, cause it could be like,
I like to use it a trade expression,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I tend to use it for plants overall
expression, how it's expressing in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the reason I say that is because
it's how its overall expression is in that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular environment with that
particular stringent set of variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So expression works well with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, that's a, that's a term that
does work, but a lot of people say that
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype that's the phenotype from that
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And phenotype is refer referring to a
specific trait expression, not the overall
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The overall plant is not the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say, the genotype is XYZ and
that's relating to the genes behind the
[SPEAKER_03]: physical expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the genotype isn't something you're
necessarily visually seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that underline genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, by definition, it's not what you are
observing by definition.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the other term I've heard that
I think I use with, when you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the plants, it just to use the term
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a that's great too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will vary V2 individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that applies very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and in strand things like that,
you know, obviously that's not what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: called, but people do it anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's also like the other things
that here are providence instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: provenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a lot of terms that people
have tried to move on in or use and adapt
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't quite fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, those are the two big ones,
strand and providence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when you get strand out from
strain, I think in linguistics is called
[SPEAKER_00]: like a, it's a kind of slippage is what
they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one, one thing I'll say is that
you have people on one end who think,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it doesn't, it just doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as long as generally people know what
I mean, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have people on the other end who
are like almost like unwilling to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, unless you have like, locked
everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're never going to get to that end
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it comes back to what you were
saying, Matt, about like, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, unfortunately a bit of a
blurry line between the established
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific terms and some of the terms
that we consistently use as a community of
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we unfortunately are going to have to
deal with some of that ambiguity because
[SPEAKER_00]: language just isn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we definitely don't have perfect
language for what we're doing yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, hopefully one day we will get closer,
but I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that either end of that
spectrum is not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it doesn't really make sense either
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't just say anything goes and
you can't say like, we have to have it
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect before we can talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously some kind of sweet spot
between those two and that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so as a language person,
I just want to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those are the two questions,
miscellaneous questions I thought I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: throw in there to wrap this episode up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe I did want to gesture towards
some possible future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we might just have another
episode that's kind of similar to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have more, um, scenarios that
are different enough from the ones we've
[SPEAKER_00]: covered today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll do another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a possible suggestion from
quasi to do a separate episode on
[SPEAKER_00]: baselines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when we say baselines, I think Matt
has referred to that in the past as like
[SPEAKER_00]: the big names like Hayes skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what else is in there, Matt?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Durbin.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's a lot, there's a few
overalls, but like majority speaking skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: one or lights Hayes are the big three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kind of major precursors that,
um, kind of like the upstream parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the upstream nodes to a lot of the,
uh, cannabis that we see today,
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be cool, uh, for an
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, the other exciting, uh,
possibility is we may get high and
[SPEAKER_00]: lonesome back for another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he did tell me that he would be
quite keen to speak on breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: recessives and also to speak on his
Appalachia projects, which obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is a, is a big, big story and
has, you know, many twists and turns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be very fun to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so there's plenty, plenty for,
for people to look forward to and the
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, let's see, we also have the,
uh, see to custom glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, I, I think tomorrow I get to see the
breeder syndicate versions of their glass
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm super stoked, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think that's one, one thing like
I've talked about it, like you get leveled
[SPEAKER_03]: up every once in a while, um, in certain
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like glass is not my forks eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't, I don't, I didn't really
understand it being anything more than
[SPEAKER_03]: just a thing to get from point A to point
B tool, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To get from point A to point B smoke to
lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't really understand that,
like, there are certain techniques that
[SPEAKER_03]: can be used in glass for making things
clear fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, these are overall so much better
than any piece that I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the fact that we get to have,
like breeder syndicate branded ones blows
[SPEAKER_03]: my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's end game, end game cap
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So props to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stoked to show them, um, show them to
everyone and make them available to
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone, which is rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's epic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to add one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, while we're doing this kind of like
outro, like, um, I've been watching our
[SPEAKER_00]: stats and I'm really, really pleased to
see that the engagement for the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes has really gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're getting the most comments that
we've ever gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in our recent episodes, you know,
not counting like very, very old videos
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been around for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're getting like as almost as many
comments as those in the pit in the space
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'm really stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep commenting, keep, keep, uh,
interacting, you know, like I like
[SPEAKER_03]: engaging with people in the comments,
cause it's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just, it just takes the episode
further and learning further.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually, some of the comments,
like if you go through there, like you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: catch like, old vets talking in there
that'll say who they are and you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: realize, Oh shit, that's that person.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people chime in that are really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the place where like,
if you're not in the discord, cause
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously people can use the discord to do
this, but it's also the place where if
[SPEAKER_00]: you, um, disagree with anything that we've
said, or you have more questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: like definitely bring them up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, last week,
we're not going to always be perfect and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to miss out on some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to keep prompting us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't keep prompting us because we
can always follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like actually I mentioned that,
like, for example, uh, it wasn't in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, but not so actually popped up in
the chat last week to kind of clarify that
[SPEAKER_00]: applying can actually be true breeding
just for a one trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that that's not the same as a
plant being true breeding for a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of significant traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have one trait that's,
uh, you're applying could be breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, homozygous dominant for one
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's technically a true breeding
plant for that trait, but you could also
[SPEAKER_00]: have a plant that's like, you know,
homozygous dominant for a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have something that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those more like, more like a quote
unquote IBL, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, and that set of terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random example of like, you know,
good little followups here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, uh, let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget to join the discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget, don't forget to click like,
subscribe, share all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The things you're supposed to do to be
supportive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shows you like, I guess it does help.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, or hit dislike if you fucking
hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, I think that is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for, for, uh, us here at Breeders
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have an underground syndicate
discord where we get together and solve
[SPEAKER_03]: old strain history together daily.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an amazing community of learning away
from IG and it's an amazing resource for
[SPEAKER_03]: old catalogs and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope you join our union of breeders and
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come check it out.
