[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dog, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an old conversation with the
homie, Resin Lung.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been MIA for a little bit,
but we miss him quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a funny, funny dude, so I hope you
guys enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk, homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's chop it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell these folks about your experience
with the Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you came about it, your first
interaction with it, seeing it in LA,
[SPEAKER_01]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, you want exact dates?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, fuck the dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit changed my life, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I grew the best weed on earth,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I smoked some Kush and realized I
grew bunk ass weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to get the cut, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was early.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 2000 when I got the cut around
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when it came under your grasp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had some buddies that were fucking
blowing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were fucking legends up here in the
valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, you know what's funny is as long as
I've grown to know you and we've become
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and shit, I really realized when
you said that those guys were legends in
[SPEAKER_01]: the valley, they actually were legends in
the valley for the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it's true and verified over time,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's no joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew a shit load of fucking OG,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, a lot of people puffed on OG
because of the fucking weed we grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of weed, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about how you guys did some of those
fucking mansions, how you guys fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: bust them up and fucking... Dude,
we'd take holes out of the fucking things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would just chew them up, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't give a fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it would cost us fucking 20 grand to
get the fucking place fixed after a year,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the floors and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that shit wasn't anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a drop in the bucket compared to
what you guys were making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it was expensive the way we grew
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really cheap, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck, we used to pay 500 a fucking day
to get it trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't all profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, yeah, we got good money for
those pounds back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one story that fucking... I don't
know if you can tell it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just about how one of the many
methods back in the day that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: have used to get it across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you should share that
though or not, except you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's been so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the moves was those bounce houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For parties and shit, where little kids
jump up and down in them and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a company who had a catalog of
them, and they had some that were giant,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they weighed like three tons,
and you would fucking have to unfold them
[SPEAKER_02]: in an aircraft hanger and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we would go to the factory and
fucking... Before they folded them up,
[SPEAKER_02]: we would fucking put our shit in there and
they'd fold them all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd stack trucks full of them
and shit and fucking send them to Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it went to Atlanta, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nobody wants to fucking open up one
of them bouncy houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck no, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would take 10 dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, once you got past fucking...
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of California, most police stations
didn't have 10 dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we lost a load or two
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still some in Oklahoma somewhere,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some fucking locker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did you guys get a lot of seeds coming
out of your packs back then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, after like 10 years, I probably got
maybe... This is 10 years, fucking 10
[SPEAKER_02]: houses or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably 85 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that... Nah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every 35 pounds... Let's say a house would
pull 35 to 40 pounds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd probably get like two or three
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two seeds that were decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, it wasn't a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys actually looked for them and
checked for them so they weren't getting
[SPEAKER_01]: out, so you weren't making competition,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I know some of them did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd get through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, fuck this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the amount we were charging for the
pounds, the dudes that bought the pounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were going to keep them seeds,
see?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, fucking... Those seeds got popped,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the price was so high for the
fucking pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it was so fucking dang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody had seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean... Dude, it was a game changer,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, I used to change lives,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to fucking be able to fucking make
people puke at will.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they just need some Chem D,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up, Murray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's over my stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fucking Murray's yelling at me
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my boy, the dude that taught me how to
grow, he's still growing for fucking B.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the same crew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lasted that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of shit folds up on itself because
people fold on each other so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it was hard, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my most proudest thing,
is keeping that crew together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking a lot of personalities,
a lot of egos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of egos you've got to manage.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty good at fucking keeping people
from fighting and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know how you fucking keep a
leash on me sometimes, but it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to keep your eye on the prize,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else would you, I mean,
what kind of cuts were floating around
[SPEAKER_01]: during the time when you were growing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of the other variations
that were out there at the OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: None.
[SPEAKER_01]: None.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was so early on in the scene,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Early on, it was just Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just called Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't called OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just called Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just called Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it wasn't long, maybe a year or
two later, we had to start throwing the OG
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't honestly say who threw OG on it
first, but in the valley, everything was
[SPEAKER_02]: OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fucking the OG Vans store,
the OG McDonald's, fucking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you bunch of Mexicans like to call
everything OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know how we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before that, you're only growing
chronic and fucking AK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, blueberry and fucking pot of
gold and all kinds of whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: A pot of gold and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fucking real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else's weed was, you know,
I mean, it's killed, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: now we long for the fucking other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the time it was like, dude,
you got to get, we got to get that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no amount of fucking growing or
no amount of attention you could give to a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that was going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, yeah, Josh D started it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who asked that question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone just asked that, but Josh D,
he's, he's always given mad respect to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the first in the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the first dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually grew some dope, some killer
dope too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what was the strongest point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Strongest weed you had smoking up to that
point before OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, nothing even compared, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, it was such a fucking,
it was so many levels above.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you didn't get involved with shit like
sour and cam or any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were just doing OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, in the valley out here,
I've never seen a pound of cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just flooded with OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wanted it because it was all,
everybody wanted OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, I think over time,
now that people are fucking a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: worldly, they're like, Oh fuck,
now I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all production too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it wasn't, we weren't,
we weren't fucking growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was production, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were fucking running for pounds,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, there was no mix and imagine,
you know, let's throw a couple of these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in the corner for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, there was none of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just straight commercial crop and
fucking trying to bang it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the name of the nutrient line
that you guys used?
[SPEAKER_02]: Superveggie A and superveggie B.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bucket of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can still get that shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to special order it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, you can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the fucking, the, the,
the shops in the Valley or, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how many are left,
but they, they, they all carry it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's pretty, it's pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: San Fernando Valley, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big eight, one eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I, Hey, there's the curve Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fucking curve Valley and beyond
Thunderdome and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking met fucking central.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the, no, they were black and tears or
like black buckets with fucking red,
[SPEAKER_02]: red lids, but it was salty dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fucking buckets would crushed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Salt like a motherfucker, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think salt's the bomb,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm into salt, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I, I tend to, you know, use hybrid
methods for growing, but dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I, if I had to choose one or the other,
I would still go salt always.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just about knowing how to fucking
flush your weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other thing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, what was really impressive
was that fucking rest of the shit was
[SPEAKER_02]: dialed in so perfectly, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So perfectly towards the yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mango fucking ender.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just dialed in perfectly,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, when I came around, it was,
it was already done.
[SPEAKER_02]: The recipe was already set by that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever figured it out, just got it to
the, I mean, figure it out perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was perfectly dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I just realized you shaved brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it fucked up, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be all back by fucking in a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a good part about being a
fucking old Jolo, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit grows like fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't even worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how many, how many, uh, how many
pounds were you like pulling per thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: watt or were you running 600 watts back
then?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, each house was like 20 lights and,
uh, or, or at least 20 lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were pulling like, dude,
if we got two and a quarter, we were
[SPEAKER_02]: stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got two, we were stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pull 40 pounds, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, every fucking, you know, you know,
four, four times a year, we were fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause we had, we had to tear the house
down and fucking build it up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a bitch, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was a constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're constantly building and tearing
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never ending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And following fucking just a straight
recipe each time doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would get tedious, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and every now and then
someone would vary off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fucking shit would just go to shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because it was, you couldn't,
you couldn't deviate from the recipe,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you realized, real fast if
someone was fucking up and deviating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was real easy to tell who the fuck
was pinching off the top, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: after, after a little while, you know,
all of a sudden, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what 40 pounds looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden we're pulling
fucking, you know, 35 and we're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happened, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even worth fucking, you have to
let them do it, dude, because fuck,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we needed dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need, we couldn't get enough guys to
fill the houses, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, growers, it was the
hardest thing to do, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting, getting good growers,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it, you know, anybody who sat in the
house for a long time, dude, it's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially back then, it wasn't like it is
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a scary thing for a lot of people,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of these weren't, you know,
didn't know what they were fucking signing
[SPEAKER_02]: up for and they fucking, you know,
they freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it got real serious, real fucking
fast with that much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing too is,
you know, the money started getting big
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to where you start to have to,
you know, you got to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a little more dangerous,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't dime bags to your homie in the
parking lot at school and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a, it's a different world now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people that grow now don't
even understand, like don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that, that any aspects of that
kind of black market world that it was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, you can't, there's too many
people doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, back then, dude, it was,
it was like, we were fucking, we were like
[SPEAKER_02]: the magicians, dude, like wizards.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one did it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had like secret, you know, we were
like, no one was, no one knew how to
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking do it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one could, now everybody does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now everybody, you know, which is cool,
but it ain't like it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got out of it once, once, once they
stopped being the cool cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's, let's see, what else can
we, I'm trying to think of what other good
[SPEAKER_01]: stories that I've heard from you over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I wish you know what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish, I wish I could fucking get a
clearance from all my other, all my
[SPEAKER_02]: partners and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, that's not the one I'm going
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about the squirrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not some fucking squirrel shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that everybody that knows resin,
this has got to be their favorite fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell the world how you snapped took a
little snapper of a squirrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sunk it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I held it in for a minute too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I was, I was chilling on the front
yard and shit at my buddy's house and this
[SPEAKER_02]: little fucking squirrel came out of a
bush, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like ran up my arm and like up,
up to my fucking head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little baby squirrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a rat, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like running around the yard
screaming and shit this fucking thing all
[SPEAKER_02]: around me and put it in shoe box and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found out, you know, not too long
later, there's his mom was smashed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: street or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took it home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And raised it as my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, isn't that sweet?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually, you know, you got to let
the motherfuckers go because they'll,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll chew up your wires and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll burn your house down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I let it go and it's fucking
started hanging out with other squirrels
[SPEAKER_02]: in the yard and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would come around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of a sudden I got a lot of
squirrels in the yard and I was fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: feed them nuts and shit and all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would smoke, I would smoke bowls in
the fucking garage.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And squirrels would just come up all over
the place, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one day I was sitting there and I had
my bombs and I see this little fucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, I thought it was like scissor
hash, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got all that shit laying around all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect little fucking nug, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like it had a little bit of weed
in it and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, I put it in the bowl
and yeah, it was fucking squirrel shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's fucking harsh toke,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a harsh toke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was bad, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, now I should have, now nobody
fucking lets me forget that story,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great story, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snapping squirrels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking dude, I still remember that thing
going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did you realize it right away as you,
as you fucking tasted the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: nuttiness and it burned your throat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bad, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably had fucking plague fucking shit
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, the bomb was long enough to where
like it fucking, it hadn't, it hadn't
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten into my mouth before I snapped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then fucking I pulled the
carpet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had the bomb been shorter, I wouldn't have
fucking done it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause as soon as you checked my mouth,
I knew that shit wasn't weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, that was harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was squirrel turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of stories, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some, there's stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are fucking crazy shit went down,
dude.

but fucking almost killing ourselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: tapping fucking power lines and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having people blow themselves across the
fucking room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was back when you had to shave the
fucking power line, dude, with a razor
[SPEAKER_02]: blade and shit, you know, to fucking,
this is before they sold those clamps and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit at the fucking hydro stores and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why resin doesn't like organics
squirrel turps.

she bought me a bunch of different stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but she bought me this amazing book and I
just keep looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called creative cursing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has two different flat tiles that
you can change and it randomly makes up
[SPEAKER_01]: new words.

your fucking strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have all the fucking strain names I
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can guarantee nobody's going to be using
this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all random produced by the enigma
machine, the enigma machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is better than the enigma machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of people know we're having the,
the, it is a private event, unfortunately
[SPEAKER_01]: for, for some people, but, um,
uh, they know we're doing the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the big candle luminati event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not a lot of people know, but resin
was the guy behind the party last year and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's behind the party this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's our party.

[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't know fucking, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the only reason me and me and Caleb
from CSI are really good friends now is
[SPEAKER_01]: because of resin, uh, resin, resin and
Denali both actually opened that door,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but resin initially opened that door
for me to, uh, to actually speak with
[SPEAKER_01]: Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we became, uh, we fell in love
and we, we now make, uh, but babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was able to get you guys
together, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I, if I had any part in that,
that's cool.

[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller, smaller, like 10 light setups,
you know, eight, eight to 10, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: mainly to try and help some friends out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were short on cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to set them up with some fucking
house payments and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Teach them how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, OG was, yeah, when we were going
at it, dude, it was just OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no, there was no reason to fuck
with anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: No reason to change up which kind of OG
and none of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it was, you know,
the fucking rent and everything was so
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive due to where we couldn't risk
fucking, uh, we needed to know we could
[SPEAKER_02]: pull fucking this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to be, you know, they'd have to go
to clockwork or fucking, we were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be in, you know, in the red.

[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louis.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

caregivers up here and, uh, I used to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: them some pounds and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I used to just drop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I didn't have no time to fucking
wait, wait to get paid and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so sometimes I would, I would drop
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sometimes I would just go for cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, but every time I did,
I would fucking hit the dude up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like Armenians and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think pretty sure they were Armenians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Louis is Armenian.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would, every time I'd walk in and do
that, I'd hit the dude up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let me get a cut, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude would always say, this cut costs
$250,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I would fucking crack up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would seriously crack up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really thought it was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: But plus the guys, the look on the guy's
face when I would just fucking start
[SPEAKER_02]: rolling on the floor, dude, fucking
ridiculous price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would just stare there and look at me
and then I go, seriously, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: let me get a cut, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd say it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started laughing at him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a fucking bastard, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little dick, but, uh, we,
we, we did business and he was,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were friendly enough like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he didn't really dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so, uh, time goes on,
time goes on, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I get a call one day,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he fucking, and it's him, he's
panicking, dude.

[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's fucking cussing me out.

the guys that worked at that Sun Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: Caregivers?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was the owner of Sun Valley
Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no Louie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nobody named Louie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a, they just named it after,

but, uh, I just know him as the owners of
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun Valley Caregivers and shit.
