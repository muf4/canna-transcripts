[SPEAKER_03]: the audio stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we do the audio quality,
oh Jesus Yeah, I'm going off trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: it nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't know if it sounds better than
normal to me What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it better worse?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get it started and ask them before
we Because I can turn it up and I can turn
[SPEAKER_00]: it down sometimes no I did not get a
haircut nor did I shave Full rough neck
[SPEAKER_00]: this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It is a big vibrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big vibrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does look very very very phallic I
would say but I mean, it's a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just kind of how they're shaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just got a fit in my mouth,
buddy All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like everybody's saying it's
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll go with it and see how that is
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right Today's topic you want to you
want to say what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I mean we're gonna we're gonna
bounce around a little bit like always but
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we might start with
is just sort of like we keep getting
[SPEAKER_00]: questions on you know, we talk a lot about
On various shows and it's certainly a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thing on Instagram and other places of
media of like How many different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions the scene is going that we
don't like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right And you know, we've so we've
spent a bunch of time talking about like
[SPEAKER_00]: various effects and all that and then
people keep suggesting well what if we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about things that we could do or
You know on that level or something loose
[SPEAKER_00]: trucks it something constructive perhaps
or something that like even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: not very connected or whatever on any
level could accomplish right and so that
[SPEAKER_00]: like that resonated with me pretty good
because It is it is better to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: constructive things You know than it is to
I mean, it's important to like discuss the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people know what's going on,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's like it can it can
definitely seem insurmountable It does and
[SPEAKER_03]: right now is a really easy time for it to
feel insurmountable when there's so many
[SPEAKER_03]: different problems coming at cannabis in
general from so many different Directions
[SPEAKER_03]: as we see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so, you know I kind of do this
thing fairly often on the discord where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw I'll throw out some questions
for everybody to see what they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear talked about And you know,
sometimes people come up with some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good some pretty good angles on things on
top of that so we might delve into that
[SPEAKER_00]: too, but You know, yeah, how did how to
change things where we're at right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think maybe What what's really
happening is that anytime?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know people really aren't adapted to
fast change Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of changes happening
really fast and I think it makes people's
[SPEAKER_00]: heads spin to some degree And it's
happening fast enough that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know if you think this
way Matt But it's almost like every year
[SPEAKER_00]: or two is like a different scene Yeah,
especially now where that like that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: took like five or ten years For like
things to like seem dramatically different
[SPEAKER_00]: on any level And so great big strain
changes and stuff like that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: like strain, you know strains that got
popular had a longer had a longer like
[SPEAKER_00]: runtime of popularity You know the laws
change slower You know pricing and just
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a lot of things that
just seemed a little bit more stable and
[SPEAKER_00]: now everything's kind of rapid fire Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rapid fire change and that makes
people uncomfortable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah people are people are talking about
there's a bunch of stuff going on like
[SPEAKER_00]: right now on the internet of like You know
the community's trying to figure out like
[SPEAKER_00]: well, who can you part with all these
changes going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is ethical?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's right for the for something?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been black market and illicit and
clandestine for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different time kind of so What is
okay and things that weren't okay before
[SPEAKER_03]: that would get you blacklisted may not be
the same today Yeah, so I mean and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is just some of that is just changing
culture I mean, you know, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like old man yells at cloud,
you know or whatever because change is
[SPEAKER_00]: change but sometimes You know,
there's different forces now than there
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be right You know and maybe the
best way to put it in a nutshell is that
[SPEAKER_00]: like before all the forces Against us were
pretty much in prohibition Yeah to a large
[SPEAKER_00]: degree, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and I I've even been giving this some
some thought because there's people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting roasted now for some of the
people they're partnering with and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and they're fighting back and I
even Think to some degree like maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that people fight back against those
people like Matt Even for somebody like
[SPEAKER_00]: you who like it used to be very effective
to call somebody out in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, I don't know if that's even
the most effective path anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think it is and it's hard
sometimes for people who have a Past of
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that constantly, you know,
you know one way to handle certain
[SPEAKER_03]: situations But I think now it really is a
lot of beating your head against a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean people are throwing out this
names and stuff like that that's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, what it's really exposing is
that you know, there's uh There's never
[SPEAKER_00]: been like this uber ethical time in weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah weeds always been full of shady
characters You know for a long time it was
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal in various regards You know,
and so some people, you know Some people
[SPEAKER_00]: were in it just because they felt like
that was silly and they loved weed Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know some people are in it because
they were criminals Yeah, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and that was just another
criminal shit to do or whatever and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people Are in it for rep and money and
some people are in it for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to say they're in it for
the plant Yeah, I mean that's a good thing
[SPEAKER_03]: to say it's a good talking point,
but it isn't necessarily true for everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: But what people are noticing is by
people's associations now, right now
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting to realize Well,
like where do those ethics lie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and so there's and you know,
and it's it's gone back I mean Matt Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: remembers even like when Colorado first
went legal There was people in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: that should remain nameless that got into
battles with buddies of ours About like
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know go legal That's the option
and if you don't then your unfair
[SPEAKER_00]: competition and it's not even snitching or
ratting to like get you gone Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're just untaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not paying the same dues I am like
you're refusing to take the path And so
[SPEAKER_00]: that was like a massive split in the
community that was it that was a very big
[SPEAKER_03]: turning point in the community when when
it became possible to Snitch people out to
[SPEAKER_03]: med boards and not necessarily the police
and at what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Point is yeah, or you know or doxing or
their boxes Yeah, it's just a just a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of pressure tactics to get people
off their back because a lot of times You
[SPEAKER_00]: know really what it boils down to is
there's people that are making all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of choices about their own personal future
and their friends, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: and in some cases like when they get
exposed they don't want to be exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: because They feel like that might hurt
their customer base.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right seat cells potentially which
could hurt their ability To partner with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these people because they have to
be useful to these bigger powers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and stuff like that, right and so So
there's an aspect now where it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of There's a lot of secret
snitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of doxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of like through proxies or
whatever and and how so Kind of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happened is now is like the community has
sort of lost the ability to police itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even believe that word,
but it's like now people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's acceptable to work with
police Yeah it is, you know like and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh this you know and yeah,
so I mean that that's about as a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and eighty degree sea change as you can
possibly imagine Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're discussing issues now, but really
what it boils down to is So I look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I I talk about it in my head like I
think about this a lot right where my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life they've been telling me for in
regards to cannabis that it's It's bad for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we've all been fighting in this
in this community like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the overgrown overgrow was named Right for
people that don't know the first real weed
[SPEAKER_00]: forum overgrow was named because the
concept was overgrow the government Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if too many people start growing and
so many people start disobeying and people
[SPEAKER_00]: refuse to respect the law then eventually
they'll have to Change the law so that
[SPEAKER_00]: people keep respect for others Yeah,
so that was like the whole that was like
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole theory right was like was You
know was overgrown yeah, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so now we have that comes from Warner
or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry Keys no Keys Hawker Hooker,
you know, one of my time in I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was that concept it was him and
we're not Mellow yellow the whole thing
[SPEAKER_03]: his big thing was to get a bunch of hemp
plants Give them out for free hemp clones
[SPEAKER_03]: and say overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how we're gonna do it I'm keeping
away all the hemp plants before before
[SPEAKER_00]: 1996 when California actually passed
Proposition 215 which was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: medical in the country and it was the
first place to take it from totally
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal to like a path towards Like like
you can call it a gray area Do you
[SPEAKER_00]: remember when they used to push for like
to get like hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies to move to Wyoming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it was so lightly populated
we could probably affect the vote and
[SPEAKER_00]: people were trying to figure out Well,
what state can we actually get some
[SPEAKER_00]: movement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What state can we actually get something
and now we've overgrown to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: people are looking around at prices And
how to survive and all the various things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are happening and man like maybe man
Maybe we over grew a bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so that aspect that price dive
that worry that we talk about that's
[SPEAKER_00]: caused a lot of people to look around and
and and Choices are being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, people are mentioning certain
choices right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean when we're talking about choices
You can go back to even the the roll-up of
[SPEAKER_03]: of how it worked and how the community
reacted when we saw things like icy mag
[SPEAKER_03]: and heaven stairway get taken down he was
mentioning shebang, you know, that was one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the people that got taken down for I
believe running icy mag and heaven
[SPEAKER_00]: stairway After that when that happened and
was that oh five Somewhere I see man was
[SPEAKER_03]: late of a heaven stairway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right about oh five heavens I mean
haven't stairway that got like cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: world and overgrown taken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's all part of the same bus
It's all part of the same thing when that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got scared enough of the internet I
honestly didn't really start poking around
[SPEAKER_00]: again until Social media really came back
on in the mid teens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was scared off it for a while,
you know I got scared off I see back once
[SPEAKER_03]: the cops ceased the search
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know that so there's an aspect of
You know, people are asking well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what can we do to change things
positively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's an aspect of I'm not
big on mentioning names on the show or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of comments going on But
obviously like there's a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: going on recently on IG and and you know,
people are talking about like Associations
[SPEAKER_00]: that people are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you can you can vote with
your wallet Yeah, they're gonna try to
[SPEAKER_00]: hide their work and off in different
brands and different this and different
[SPEAKER_00]: that You can figure out who they are and
you can not spend your money on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They essentially need An enormous amount
of consumer money to stay afloat always
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all doing this because they think
this is the best money play for themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to hurt them is to is to deny
that money play Yeah, right is to you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, you can so, you know, maybe maybe
I'll continue my thought or whatever So my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life they can't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it You can't have it right
and now we're at this point where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like man, this thing's kind of cool I
mean, we'll take it from here Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to me The fight hasn't changed really
the fight has just shifted we used to
[SPEAKER_00]: fight for access and acceptance Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big fight access acceptance
and the ability to do that without getting
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble Just because it's a plant
that's fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so now we're kind of getting there
Yeah, we made we've made way faster
[SPEAKER_00]: expansion on access and and safety and the
ability to use it and I think within a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of years a lot of these like
piss-testing For jobs will go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was something announced
today about that right in the news I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure actually but it's gonna go away soon
because so many states are led to making
[SPEAKER_00]: it legal It's just gonna you know,
and then wide varieties of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be able to start using it without
penalty Yeah, it has something to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: jobs not being able to discriminate in
legal states where there's medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and Yeah, they're not allowed to
discriminate against legal cannabis if I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so here's the gig when it As it shifts
from like safety and freedom and access
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and the right to do so now it's
gonna shift to like who controls it who
[SPEAKER_00]: sells it to you like who You know like
that really who controls it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fight and it probably will be a
fight that we're battling but what people
[SPEAKER_00]: have to remember it's dark days right now
and It's like a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: like deeply in the cannabis industry are
hurting pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is why I think It's causing
some of these desperate moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, right is that when it comes down to
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that like they want to
survive they want to make money and if
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to deal with the devil they will
Right, but I would like to throw out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that You know when it comes down to it
that we are winning Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the fight has shifted You
know what we fight, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's we that's winning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean in the sense that like,
you know imagine 15 years ago if you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that Like 38 or 40 states in in in
America would allow recreational or
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cancers Right like there's more
access for more people now than ever
[SPEAKER_00]: before Yeah, right, so we're not happy
with the direction the scene is going but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's because our previous goal we were
all pretty united on we want this thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: be available and accessible and not get
people in trouble and We want to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke and share weed Yeah, and now it's
gone into like this economic thing where
[SPEAKER_00]: People are what like when you think about
I don't want to say corporations because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just like a group of people or
whatever But when you think about big
[SPEAKER_00]: business say yeah, they're gonna want to
control it They're gonna want to patent
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna want to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the recreational stuff going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly legal It's more like
highly regulated tightly taxed and
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you know nothing nothing
Decriminalized about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I mean if I want to grow a bunch of
vegetables or tomatoes or fruit or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that in my backyard I can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow as many tomatoes as I want I
can cross tomatoes every person on this on
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing that I I could send them tomato
seeds thousands Yeah, we could all we
[SPEAKER_00]: could all trade and share and post
pictures of our Hybrids and our this and
[SPEAKER_00]: our that and everything else and it would
be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would give a shit That's legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have is like so what we have going
on Right now is that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a six plant limit for in your
state You basically can't breed Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't keep mom stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a normal amount of plants
that a person even a hobbyist and this
[SPEAKER_03]: spare to me this is where the the term
legal legalization was bastardized and a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of Because even when I was 15 even
when I was 15 I knew that once
[SPEAKER_03]: corporations got their hands dug in deep
enough to be able to take Over immediately
[SPEAKER_03]: that's when they're gonna flip the bill
even as a 15 year old kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized that's how the world works
That's how corporations work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happened But I did not expect
them to push it under the guise of
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization Because even today any any
average citizen who doesn't grow but
[SPEAKER_03]: smokes and if you ask them if weed is
legal They're gonna tell you yes 99% of
[SPEAKER_03]: the time Yes, and they don't even know
what's happening to the real grower side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the aspect that there's nothing legal
about They're making it legal in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to possess or whatever, but you still have
to go to approved stores and buy it from
[SPEAKER_00]: approved vendors and as we both know that
invites corruption and all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels sure, you know, and so strangely
and this might be like from a capitalist
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective this might be one of the first
cases that I know of of this where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like The legalization of something led to
a massive drop in quality and a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: increase in price Hmm yeah, I don't know
about the massive increase in price with
[SPEAKER_03]: the drop in quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hard one You know, well,
I mean there's think about how many people
[SPEAKER_00]: are buying like 70 and $80 eighths Yeah
Right, yeah and think about how expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff is now Yeah, yeah,
and I mean there's there's plenty of cheap
[SPEAKER_00]: too, but it's like the taxes I mean I saw
that thing where you know, they broke down
[SPEAKER_00]: like how much an eighth is and like the
farmer gets three bucks and the tax man
[SPEAKER_00]: gets 21 bucks and the and the and the
disco gets 20 bucks and then the Freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: you know dispensary gets 40 bucks and you
end up paying 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, it's it's that that is
preposterous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like three layers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the distribution and there's the
store and they're all You know pillaging
[SPEAKER_03]: because they can't I paid attention when I
was a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched that movie Robin Hood And I
remember there was a sheriff of Nottingham
[SPEAKER_03]: and I remember they would Bug people for
money and I kept that with me growing up
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was like wow this tax thing's a scam
Isn't it like to at some level at some
[SPEAKER_03]: level the way it works now This is we've
all been conditioned to think that this is
[SPEAKER_03]: what we need to do and I agreed to have
society people need to pitch in but I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: what I what I think has happened is like
You know, it's one of those things where
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime they any kind of vice becomes more
acceptable They want to give money to cops
[SPEAKER_00]: in schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, obviously like they're just like
well, you know, here's funding for various
[SPEAKER_00]: groups Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're gonna tax the shit out of
this vice or whatever it might be We're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to ease the other voting house
and you know They they made taxes based
[SPEAKER_00]: probably on like a much higher pound price
than people are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in that regard, so You know So it's
not really so that's really what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happened is like in the 215 era Anybody
could grow whatever they wanted and if
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a medical card and they grew good
enough weed They could walk into a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and they could make a deal
Yeah, and that allowed a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: things to proliferate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean one of the one of the aspects of
the person that's getting shit talked a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch this week Is that not only are
