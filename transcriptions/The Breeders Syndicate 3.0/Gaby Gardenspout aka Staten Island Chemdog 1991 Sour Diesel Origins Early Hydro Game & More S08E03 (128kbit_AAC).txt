[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_02]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_02]: Not-so-dog, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start writing some rongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Not-so-dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to jump in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not-so-dog has an intro for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very special, special
episode, and we hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, Not-so, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to give an intro into
what we're going to be talking about for a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty excited about this one because
it's got one of my oldest friends on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to keep his name and his
visage secret for a while to protect him
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, but he has decided that he is
willing to come on and chat in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the guy that I call Staten Island
is my very, very old friend, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the reason why I got the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the reason why I got the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy that brought them west.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear a bunch of stuff of
him talking, which some of it will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be pretty new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was buddies with Klopp,
which a lot of people call Weasel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played a pretty important role,
in my opinion, about keeping the chem-dog
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys on the West Coast, Skunkthea,
IC Collective, myself, all of us really
[SPEAKER_00]: owe it to him for the reason why we got
the chem-dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our little crew kept it together for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's done a variety of things in
cannabis during his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not very well known, but he played
some pretty important roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in addition to being my really old
friend, I'm super glad that he's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: finally show his face and start talking a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be a little bit embarrassed about
it or discount what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, he's pretty darn
important in the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really did a lot to push cannabis
forward, not just from a genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, but from teaching people how
to grow weed and opening up stores when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was pretty risque.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just really stoked to be able
to bring a super old friend on and chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you all like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will be a multi-part episode,
so I guess kick back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll insert this on each one of the
episodes so that there is some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: clarity for each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other point is that because he is the
way that he is, you're going to hear a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people's real names, maybe not so much
their internet handles or their forum
[SPEAKER_00]: names or whatever, because he might not
know those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people, when he talks about
Klopp, for instance, Klopp is Weasel,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is one of the critical people early on
in the sour diesel tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben is IC Collective, Jason is Skunk Va,
or Skunk VA, as the case may be,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he drops names so often,
there's no way for Matt and I to really
[SPEAKER_00]: edit it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, also one more thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The audio is kind of all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the clarity, there's some
feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just we're doing these interviews and
it was so important to get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the main reasons that this
clone made it to guys like me,
[SPEAKER_02]: CSI, and the rest of the country for what
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so important to get it done
that we felt that audio quality was less
[SPEAKER_02]: important than audio content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we hope you'll excuse that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost brought it up, but I didn't want
to bring it up when we were recording
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was like, maybe he'll hate me
and want me to cut it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when we were the people
that were taking all that BHO down to all
[SPEAKER_00]: the clubs and none of them had ever seen
it and we had to teach them how to use it
[SPEAKER_00]: and spot them stuff because they had no
BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even believe that it was
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite stories to
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's tell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's tell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling that story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'm incriminating myself 30
years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, it was more like 20 ish,
but still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, like what I told Francis
before we start was I was doing BHO in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2006 and I thought I was a fucking
pioneer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hearing this, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you hit record yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't see it recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're so this was in, well,
I opened up the garden spout in 2002 and
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think I got fired from hydro depot
and that's another story about,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, fire from hydro depot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It must've been either 2000 or 2001.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was 2000 and it was that time
in between.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause the only reason why I was doing it
was trying to figure out how to make
[SPEAKER_06]: money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, in between doing that,
you know, once I opened up the garden
[SPEAKER_06]: spout, I wasn't fucking around like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I got shown how to make,
uh, BHO.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately at the time, like the way we
knew how to do it was like in a PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we got to do it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, even though I was open blasting,
I lived like on top of a hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and, you know, it wasn't just
like doing it indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was doing it like where there was
outdoor ventilation happening and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, put like a coffee filter on the
bottom of a PVC pipe and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we only made it to coffee filters in 2006.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the end, the other end,
it would just be a cap with a hole in it
[SPEAKER_06]: that you could fit the fitting on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It fit the fitting.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just my dab rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not like open blasting him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but so like I made the first BHO I had
ever seen or heard of him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I can remember where I learned
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who taught you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who was teaching you that early?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to think the other day of who
taught you, but Gabby had this property in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hills above where I live now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he had like, I don't know,
it was like 28 acres or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we never, we never had any like,
like of the many stories of explosions or
[SPEAKER_00]: terror that went on because we literally
went out and like on top of the hill in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of a field and, you know,
away from all electronics and you were not
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this in San Diego garages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no, we did it literally on a,
on a mountain, on a mountain, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on a hilltop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I can't claim the same a hilltop
with wind, but you know, we had to get
[SPEAKER_00]: like there wasn't any machines yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally, like he said,
it was skinny PVC tubes that we cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disclaimer, do not do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there, there was no,
we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know anything about purging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that we purged that by stir
was by stirring it, you know, a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have a blast dish with all the
solvent, you know, extracted stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it was still bubbling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in order to make it happen faster,
we would put that dish in another dish
[SPEAKER_06]: where we would pour boiling water,
boiling water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had already, you know, had it collected
there, warm boiling right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'd do it again until it stopped
being active.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it obviously still had plenty of
butane in it, you know, I would put it in
[SPEAKER_06]: a jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would bring it to the cannabis
clubs in Oakland and in San Francisco and
[SPEAKER_06]: in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it, you know, for the time,
this shit was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was prior to, you know,
the modern dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was none of those accoutrements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we would smear it on top of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we figured out that like there was
those old like like disc puck looking
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would like light the charcoal and
drop it on top and drop it on top and then
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Gabby and I would go down to the
bay and like the store owners,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was such a foreign substance to them
that like we would have to spot it to them
[SPEAKER_00]: to like the owners and like leave it with
them and wait for feedback to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sure go go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to smoke it out of crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crack pipes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like, or, you know, you know,
well, not like a straight tube,
[SPEAKER_06]: but just like the bowl with the bowl,
the meth pipe, meth pipe, meth pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really, I never smoked cracker
meth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, like the bottom and then
with a lighter, we would heat it up and it
[SPEAKER_06]: would start boiling and we would smoke it
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I brought it to some clubs in San
Francisco and Oakland and Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just, it's too crack like they
loved the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they loved it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so at the time I was offering it to
them for $50 a gram.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, they enjoyed smoking it with
me, but they were just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is a medicinal club and this looks
too much like crack.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't give us the right vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to use tools that are weird with
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we did was, you know, one day I'm
like thinking, what the fuck am I going to
[SPEAKER_06]: do with this shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody wants it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I had some trim and I got some of
this goopy extract and I started just
[SPEAKER_06]: pressing the trim into the extract until
it would accept no more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was basically like at least 75%
trim being held together by a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: of extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought this to the clubs and you
could just rip a little piece off,
[SPEAKER_05]: stick it in a pipe and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they freaked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me your first experience
smoking that stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time you ever went from smoking
flour to smoking something that strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually had been smoking oils way
prior to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I knew people who were bringing
oil back from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was like in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we want to hear this.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would bring back green honey oil and
clear honey oil in like, what is it
[SPEAKER_06]: called?
[SPEAKER_06]: Shampoo bottles, you know, with like bags
inside and, you know, this stuff made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we used to just get joints and just
coat the outside of them and just fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: make it super disgusting.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was my first experience in
smoking concentrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know how the Jamaican honey
oil was made.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certain it wasn't from BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were using things like the
ISO 2 extractor, if you remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a spaceship, like Ed Tiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, what was that called?
[SPEAKER_02]: ISO 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isomerizer 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so that was the first time I
ever smoked concentrate was in the
[SPEAKER_06]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_06]: That type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so when I brought this, my favorite
part of the story is I brought them the
[SPEAKER_06]: pure oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the best quality concentrate they had
ever seen to that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were just like, I don't know how
to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought them stuff that I put trash in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I literally just put as much
trim on it as it would possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I knew it was done when the trim
would just fall off and not stick to it
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I brought it to them and they were
buying it for me, 50 bucks a gram,
[SPEAKER_06]: selling it for a hundred bucks a gram.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we made like, you know, like I said,
at first we got to spot it to them
[SPEAKER_06]: because, you know, but after a while they
were buying the shit and I was the only
[SPEAKER_06]: one making like nobody knew had a make
this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's funny because we would now,
now it's like extracts and concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: are such a big part of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember being in clubs with Gabby,
like trying to convince the owners and the
[SPEAKER_00]: buyers, like what it was, that it worked,
you know, get it like, and then the other
[SPEAKER_00]: part is Gabby, do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what the name of it was,
but Gabby found this, this container place
[SPEAKER_00]: in Santa Rosa that like sold all kinds of
different weird sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of little plastic containers of all
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, cause we were at the first,
we were like, what do we even put this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we didn't even know what to put on
containers that, you know, you could
[SPEAKER_05]: scrape it off and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he found this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic glass crack jar that you can get
at a head shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, he went and he bought all these
different like, like stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stiles of like rectangles and cylinders
and different little things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we experimented with like,
which one was accessible and which one we
[SPEAKER_00]: could actually get it into and play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was like, we didn't have any
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, and we used to sit there like,
you know, and it's like in the open blast
[SPEAKER_00]: era or whatever, you have cases of butane
and then you're like, got these PVC tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember being on Gabby's porch
because it took, you know, it took hours
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes just to get prepped and pack all
the tubes with all the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smalls and the trim and the whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you start off with
like these smooth PVC tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after you've used them for a while,
you stick your finger in there and you rub
[SPEAKER_00]: it around and you realize that it's like
not smooth anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, oh, oh no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Years later, maybe that wasn't the best
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, and my dad read,
give me a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was, okay, I'll talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny in the sense that like,
as we were talking earlier on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, earlier recording about how when
we were making seeds, there wasn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry or the, like all the stuff
set up around to sell seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very much like that with BHL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the only thing that people had in
shops back then was like a few kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't, there wasn't nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't heating elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't like specific rigs to smoke
hash out of some of the rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we're, I mean, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember, I won't say
his full name, but you remember Gabby E
[SPEAKER_00]: had that, had that water, that bong that
like opened up, you know, so you could
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it was like, it like had like a,
like a lamp shade looking thing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could put it over when he lived in
the Sebastopol house and you could put it
[SPEAKER_00]: over the burning coil and you could drop
dabs on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have a, I have a question for
both of you because this is before my
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but it's something I watched as a
kid and I never understood it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never really asked my dad to what
the hell it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you worked at a head shop and
you know all this stuff, he had a bamboo
[SPEAKER_02]: bong, I think it was, and he would take my
Play-Doh and stick it on the motherfucker
[SPEAKER_02]: all around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would get so mad and I didn't know,
looking back, I can't figure out why he
[SPEAKER_02]: stole my Play-Doh for his bamboo bong
because his bong wouldn't have gotten hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as a kid I figured, Oh, it must be
getting hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Jamaicans, Jamaicans had these bamboo
style pipes that they would use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I forget their technical name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can't remember the name either,
but like on, on a dead shows and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was all this art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, what was, what was that clay art?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby, do you remember what it was called?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they would form it into like little
Jerry heads or like little, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could, you know, and it would
like harden over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just something, an artist could
easily turn it into a pipe and a piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: art at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something that like you could do
while you're driving home, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: without like a lot of equipment or it's
like, you can't have a glass studio while
[SPEAKER_06]: you're driving to the next show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe people would be funny to hear
this, but like definitely the first time I
[SPEAKER_00]: did, and it's probably the first time
Gabby did was probably the first time that
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever saw glass was like Bob's nod
grass blowing, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and having his van and, and selling it at
shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody smoked out of stone or
clay or metal or wood or plastic or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I remember Gabby joking
later on that like, you know, Bob stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like it was made by a kid kind of
in certain ways, but like at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was the only, you know,
he had like, Gabby had like a couple cases
[SPEAKER_00]: of just Bob work, you know, classic skull
with a top hat, pipe, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put it away, but I have a chem dog
piece and I got him to blow the only piece
[SPEAKER_02]: that doesn't look like a Bob's nod grass
hippie piece with hippie milliflory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he put in punk rock milliflory for me
in this little one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be like that Gabby had like
the height of what was the coolest thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for hippies to have back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was he had this big steam roller
that Bob did with a full dragon inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the bowl, as you smoked it,
it would pull the smoke down through the
[SPEAKER_00]: dragon head and blow it out the dragon's
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would suck it through the
steam roller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't fill the pipe with smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make like a straight line from
the dragon's mouth to yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like a clear steam roller,
but then it had this worked dragon's head
[SPEAKER_00]: with all like these flares and colors and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is made by someone in our group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll plug it while we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just it was it was literally
like that was the only place in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning where we knew how to get glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then it expanded to like
apprentices and friends of Bob,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like a group in Eugene and
stuff like that that was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, but people didn't we didn't when
we were making the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that was funny is like
we were making the hash out of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, trim and smalls from the dog and
like our super dog experiments and the
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was definitely a few
experiences where we weren't used to the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a little bit of panic at the
disco, you know, because you're like you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke weed with your friends and you
didn't realize how little you needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: get lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would smoke a little bit too much
and get nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the first time I smoked moon rocks
when we were talking about doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I didn't know if you wanted me to
bring it up or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But literally that was I was 2000 or 2001
because as soon as he opened the shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: he quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did a lot of it in 2000,
2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least amongst our friend group and
at least amongst going to the stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that, like none of the owners,
they'd never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd never they had no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no idea how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no idea how to market it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like they were concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost like they had to get some of
it and give some to customers and get good
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they got excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, you know, it and there
wasn't that many stores, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few in Oakland like Gabby was
saying there was the third floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a place that our buddy owned who
will remain nameless at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a place in Berkeley on Shattuck
Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were and they were pretty cool
because they were punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like it was like where the
anarchists met to plan like like social
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they didn't make any money off of
their they were like full medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't make any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made like a 15 percent markup.
[SPEAKER_00]: To pay for costs and employee salaries and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you gave them a screaming deal,
you could go up and see it on the board
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would literally be 15 percent more
expensive than what you gave it to them
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where everybody else was like doubling or
tripling their money or whatever on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely semi-profit based.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were literally like just the overhead
to run the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you remember that spot on
Shattuck, Gabby, that we would go to?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so different than the rest of
them because they literally were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they were punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very punk rock about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how good you guys can see
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the orangutan titties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not familiar with orangutan titties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's a new one to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Grease Monkeys times Skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know Parker Francis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do know Parker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, I know a few Parkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mosel, PZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, if you won the Emerald Cup last
year in the personal use category with
[SPEAKER_06]: this Genetic and this is one of the ones
that I got at the nursery.
[SPEAKER_06]: But rolling some up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not driving today, as you guys can
tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm able to imbibe a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, too, that we were making it,
we were concerned about fire or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we took such extreme precautions
because we were out literally in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of a field and we would heat the
water far away and then bring it and do
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do what people did later with
electrical or try to do it in garages or
[SPEAKER_00]: try to do it in a shed or anywhere it
could build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never had any of the horror stories
of accidents, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we could have.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, again, don't attempt this at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid things that young people do when
you don't know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like at the time, it was like
we'd never even heard the term BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically just like a situation
where whoever taught Gabby, I can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: remember his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what we called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what we called it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like, dude, you can pack this
tube full of smalls and small nugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: trim and it'll melt all the THC right off
it and then collect it in this thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll turn all this stuff that you just
sit around anyway and gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was the first time we'd
ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby taught it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ended up doing it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be clipped right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that statement that you guys ended up
doing it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just talking about not so getting
clipped like awkward out of context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of context.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys familiar with this product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blind.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called King Palms.
[SPEAKER_02]: King Palms, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a product that I really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make it's like a it's like a cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have seen those.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's made out of a palm leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I don't smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was somebody on the discord talking
about how, you know, they're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke blunts till they die.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like blunts because I don't smoke
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it really just like you have a
beautiful flower and then you put,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, roll it with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was skeptical about these.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought these for my lady as an
alternative to blunts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're really thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You think that they're going to burn like
really hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, but man, these things actually
burn better than papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, what are the does the
paint?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to hand them out because they're
fucking harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: They burn so fast, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: These they have this little thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just fill it by hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I drop the joint in there and then you
give it a little Coke with the supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like poker, put a little bit more in
there and I can actually roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, I cannot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I used to use rolling machines
just to like do a better job and make it
[SPEAKER_06]: faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like we said in yesterday's,
I would do like 10, you know, the morning
[SPEAKER_06]: before I left for work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this thing, what you get is such an
elegant product and you really can taste
[SPEAKER_06]: the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this is a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought about it while you were
chatting where when, when Gabby and I
[SPEAKER_00]: became friends, like a lot of hippies,
we were club paper, you know, exclusives,
[SPEAKER_00]: various sizes of clubs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of different sizes depends on
what you're rolling, whether you're
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling a thumb size joint or a pinner or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't have a palette to do it,
but Gabby could straight up taste glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody would believe, nobody would
believe that he could actually taste the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know how many times it
happened, but it happened numerous times
[SPEAKER_00]: where like we would literally blindfold
Gabby and people would roll joints of the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same weed and one would have glue
and one wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd take a couple puffs and he'd be
like, glue, glue, glue, not glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a hundred percent right every
single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would be like, there's no way
you can tell the difference, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I think they would have been
able to tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you have like a quality herb,
like, like the chem dog that has such a
[SPEAKER_06]: good taste and then just smoking glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think you're going to be able to
say, yeah, that one's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would not believe that he could do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly, my palette, I couldn't
taste it, but Gabby learned what the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor of the glue was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent of the time he could,
he could taste glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we never smoked papers with glue
because he felt like it ruined the J.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always smoked rice glue,
glueless rice papers that you had to rip
[SPEAKER_00]: and lick in order to get them to stick,
which was mostly club before club kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: went out of business or whatever,
but it was all clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the, that was the heady hippie
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the acceptable paper for heady
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab an ashtray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was, uh, was the clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just showing those things are so
hard to use without the gum thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't get how you're supposed to
get the papers to like intertwine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only kind of joints that he
would roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those are all our friends in our
group or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you basically, you have to rip it so
that the fibers are rough and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to apply it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but yeah, John tried to show me,
oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tried to show me how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I'm watching it right
there in front of me and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No glue was, glue was subpar in our,
in our crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glue was glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you didn't use glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glue was cheating since Francis talks a
lot and is a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll go ahead and do this again and
plug our friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Gabby, have you heard of C2 glass
before?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I can get him to send you
something cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure he'd be down to send you
something cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in our group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you what I'm smoking out of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is called flow scientific glass and
has no color in it at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly just about function.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the water will come up to here
and like do like a circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a recycler.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is a recycler.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had this bong since the very
beginning of a, of me dabbing many years
[SPEAKER_05]: ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily this one, this one made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just brought home my ski mask glass
piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a clockwork orange one that I left at
my mother's for like a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never been used though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are going to want us to cover
sour and clop more thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a great era of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we covered it properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, discuss this and stuff,
but I've been thinking about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to get this out, out there
into the open and we'll all do respect to
[SPEAKER_06]: the people that are obsessing about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This topic, including you, um,
like because people are like, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: people are going to get pissed off.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get angry text messages.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, no, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the fact that anyone is getting that
worked up about something that is,
[SPEAKER_06]: we can't even prove it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just silly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we should enjoy the conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, everybody should be enjoying the
conversation and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: debating if necessary, but like for anyone
to get uptight or threatened or,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, feel wronged.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I say something that's completely
false, because, you know, happened 30
[SPEAKER_06]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, my brain has been,
any of them are welcome to come on and
[SPEAKER_02]: correct it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it doesn't even have to be like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like they don't have to,
they don't have to want to correct
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, like, you know,
it's just like, this is what one stoned
[SPEAKER_06]: aging hippie is saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mean that much, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just consider it good stories that
we can all enjoy and laugh about and try
[SPEAKER_06]: to like pull from, you know, because you
know, I don't remember who said it and,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know, somebody said that,
you know, Greg has changed his story a few
[SPEAKER_06]: times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like, he's not really the best
source of or reliable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just give him the benefit of the
doubt that he smokes a lot of weed and
[SPEAKER_06]: he's just stoned and he never remembered
the story that good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause he's, you know, but like,
he's not a liar.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we don't have to like bring the
lying, you know, and, and if we all
[SPEAKER_06]: remember it a little bit differently,
I think that's what we call perspective
[SPEAKER_06]: and, and not only perspective,
but just flawed memory.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just wanted to start by saying
that like, nobody should be getting all
[SPEAKER_06]: worked up about anything that we say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope people enjoy the conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, one thing that you said to me
yesterday, Matt, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you liked the way Francis and I talk,
you know, I mean, Francis has been my
[SPEAKER_06]: friend for over 20 years and talking to
him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for instance, if I was just talking
to you, it might not be exactly the same
[SPEAKER_06]: just because, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, not that I wouldn't be open with you
or anything, but there's no way you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: brother, you know, something else that I
wanted to say is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing like terrible, like, but like some
awkward shit happened with me and Francis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to get it out in the open.
[SPEAKER_06]: My ex fired him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, and he was like one of the most
valuable people that ever worked for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like I told people that,
you know, he, I felt like I could really
[SPEAKER_06]: help people and Francis was actually able
to help people even more, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so today, you know, I'm pretty sure I
did in the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry that that happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a total mistake and bad business
wasn't my decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, my business was slowing down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when we hired Francis, our business
was blooming and we were able to pay
[SPEAKER_06]: people what Francis needed to make.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as business got not as good,
you know, got harder to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but the point is like me and Francis
didn't talk for a while for that and maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: some other petty shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And me and VA skunk didn't talk for a few
years over again, shit that like,
[SPEAKER_06]: it shouldn't keep people that are as
connected as we are to not talk,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and I had this epiphany,
like I don't know if epiphany is the right
[SPEAKER_06]: word, but this thought, like when I
recently connected with VA again,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, you know, I really don't give
a shit about any of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_06]: happened in our past.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like any of the times that we argued and
because, you know, I said to him,
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, I love you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're an important part of my life,
important part of my history.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to let that shit go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I want to say it's exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, for me and Francis, like I love this
guy, you know, I always will, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and as you get older, you know,
you just start to realize that like,
[SPEAKER_06]: these are the things that are important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like what the exact cross of sour and
you know, chem made, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like, that shit is just like,
stuff that we should definitely discuss.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it's not worth a discussion
and like, let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean like, that's what me and Francis
used to do all the time anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to talk about weed, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But like anyone to get upset and feel
threatened about like this topic that
[SPEAKER_06]: involves shit that like, I don't,
I don't and won't understand it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So going into this topic about the sour,
which I have even less, exact information
[SPEAKER_06]: about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're just speculating, you know,
like maybe, maybe I'll interject too and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, well, I mean, what's interesting is
that you, you know, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Gabby and I were, we're chatting,
I think it was last night or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we were going over some stuff
that we won't be chatting about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, it's just, it's hard in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many twists and turns and
there's so many, like Gabby was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, life's a carnival and you know,
you have this situation where people get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I try to tell history and
I, and you know, he mentioned that I tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to be as accurate as possible,
but I also admit things because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these situations where you have friends
that have been friends for 20 or 30 years
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have ins and outs with each other
and their lives have complications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that's not really pertinent
to the story so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's not really people's
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I wasn't going to go into like,
obviously, you know, I see collective
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk VA, Gabby myself, we've all known
each other for like a really long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a really, at this point,
a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's ins and outs and ups and
downs and, and fall outs and fall ins to
[SPEAKER_00]: all that kind of stuff that, you know,
and, uh, and, uh, and our, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just how that's how life works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, people always want to
latch onto the salacious part of it to
[SPEAKER_00]: some degree, or the part that creates
conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's funny too,
because people would attack me for being
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, you don't really know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really it's like, I would be like,
dude, all my stories come honestly from
[SPEAKER_00]: like my one friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how to prove to you how
good a friends we were, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were really good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Francis were good fucking friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the stories he told seemed to be
fairly accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like nothing that I could argue with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like, yeah, we sat the
amount of times we sat on a couch together
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoked joints and talked shit about
weed or like made BHO or bread or traded
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, it was just like,
people don't realize what a different era
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, people want to jump on little
points, you know, in that regard,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, between the four or five of
us or whatever, and you go back 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years, like, like homie said,
you're going to have some different
[SPEAKER_00]: memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, it's not like when the
chem dog story was getting written or the
[SPEAKER_00]: sour story was getting written or any of
this stuff was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of us knew any of this was going to be
important later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a bunch of partying hippies who
like to see shows and like to go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: like to stay up late and like to smoke
weed and all that doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on, people are like,
Oh man, that was kind of important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like play by play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you try to give you the most
accurate play by play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if two people have a different
play by play, it doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that their memory map is a
little different maybe, or what's stuck in
[SPEAKER_00]: their head is a bit different.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think sometimes also like,
because I believe the story the way I do,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you believe the story that the way you
do, when we talk, we can like,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not trying to convince any,
it's like, this is actually what we
[SPEAKER_06]: believe, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, we're not lying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not wording it properly, but the whole
point is it's just, this is a story as we
[SPEAKER_06]: remember it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'd be happy for someone to like,
help me remember it better because I want
[SPEAKER_06]: to know the truth too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, and you know, like it took
me a minute to remember the like breathing
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that we did together, Francis,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was like, Oh yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, where did I get all that
shit from?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like I got a lot of genetics
from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like the Maui, you had gotten
that from Jason King, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we got that from, that was,
that was some of the first weed I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean and I grew that in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the weed that we got from Jason
King though?
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we get a strain from him?
[SPEAKER_05]: The mothership.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mothership, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got to grow the mothership?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've heard of pineapple mothership,
but never mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that story I told you about the
weed that got mailed to us, the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: we thought they were going to send us
cuttings and the chicks sent us like
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in two gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was how we got the mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually at one of Eddie left's
house that it got sent to that he had not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not his main property where he grew,
but like Jason was renting a house from
[SPEAKER_00]: him in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sent us the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was such a big box.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I opened it up, I almost shit my
pants because it was literally like two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that were two feet tall with bamboo
stakes in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they were going to send like
little cuttings, like in rock wall or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that happened a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two giant ass plants, you know,
and communication is off a little bit on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, uh, but yeah, uh, you know,
the, the Maui got brought out by Sean and
I.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then it was also the Mendocino
perps, you know, like I had the chem dog
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know, the super dog or,
you know, the, uh, the skunk and you had
[SPEAKER_06]: all these other strains, you know,
like I didn't have that diverse of a,
[SPEAKER_06]: of the collection that you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you had a couple things, but they were
really good things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that, all those other strains that we
crossed, you know, with the stuff that you
[SPEAKER_06]: brought in, you know, whether it was from
Jason or, and that, uh, the Maui that you
[SPEAKER_06]: brought in, that you brought from,
uh, Chicago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was epic shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, I still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's, it's 28 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my longest successful female
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might actually be in some popular
things, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that a different one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different, that, that's a
different, that's a different,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so productive and it was white.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was coated in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen it Matthew?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I still have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting this out there publicly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Francis to give me some chem dog
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're going to start shit on the
discord.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's got to like, make memes and
shit with some chem dog flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I haven't had any in a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I told Matt, you did a really
good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did a far better job than I would
have.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been thinking about it a lot more
than I have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, so, you know, there was
little details that honestly don't really
[SPEAKER_06]: matter that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the core of the story was
correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like one little detail that you got wrong
was the only reason why I got the chem dog
[SPEAKER_06]: was because I gave Greg the skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, he didn't want to give it
to me until I had something that he
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, but like I said, the details was
so little, you know, that, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can by all means ask questions,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking more like, tell a couple of
stories about, you know, like how I got it
[SPEAKER_06]: across country.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I met Klopp, you know, when I met
Greg, I want to tell people when I met,
[SPEAKER_06]: like not just met you, but like the moment
that we became friends for life,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cause there was that moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember, so what I remember
what really broke us through in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship was Sean and I were trying to
fucking figure out those water-cooled
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and they kept- It was before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, I don't know if it was
before that, but that wasn't the moment
[SPEAKER_06]: for me at least, but go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell your side, then I'll tell mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the other part of it too is
that people have different memories of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and like- I'm losing it,
but there's one, there's one thing,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's certain things that I'll never
forget, but go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell your- Because I think,
I think we actually became friends when
[SPEAKER_00]: you were working at, like the first time
we started talking was when you were at
[SPEAKER_00]: Slavic shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Hydrodipo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before there, when there was no shops in
Mendo or anything like that, we had to go
[SPEAKER_00]: south in order to get, and I mean,
I remember going, I remember going to your
[SPEAKER_00]: house in Casadero.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's where, that's where I
actually, I think that's where we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: did our first exchange of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, remember you used to make that
pasta dude with like all the veggies and
[SPEAKER_00]: the olive oil and the balsamic and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I came down, you know,
and you invited me down for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that I was going to tell was
like we, we were leaving after talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: you one day and Sean was like,
we should leave a joint, a Mendo perps on
[SPEAKER_00]: his, on his windshield wipers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hear him saying that right now in
his voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, I don't know if this is going
to be this, this should probably get cut
[SPEAKER_00]: out or whatever, dude, but I reconnected
just within the last month after years of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying with his wife and daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose wife and daughter?
Sean's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His daughter is like going to college next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll send you pics, dude,
after this call or whatever, like she got
[SPEAKER_00]: like, she looks so much, she looks like a
much prettier version of Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got like, she's not bald,
but she's got his skin tone, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: super like pale Irish.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about, how about attitude?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she's nicer, but I mean,
that's the funny thing too, is like Sean
[SPEAKER_00]: was so much like a bunch of my friends
back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was the mellower ones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I think he would have said
that you were the soft one, but I would
[SPEAKER_06]: say that about him.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me tell, let me, let me tell my
story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want this edited out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want this to be live on the internet for
eternity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Francis and Sean were customers at my
hydro store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called hydro depot at the point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, we were just being casually
friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just trying to provide good service
and be cool and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had given you my phone number and I
don't know if this was, this is definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: before we started trading clones,
you know, but I gave you my phone number
[SPEAKER_06]: for some reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you called me one night and you said,
Gabby, do you have a part for an airflow?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's like a part that like sticks out
on the bottom of the airflow, like to
[SPEAKER_06]: drain it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And somehow you broke yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you that don't know,
the airflow is an aeroponic system that if
[SPEAKER_06]: that thing's not getting water and what is
not pumping through it constantly,
[SPEAKER_06]: your plants are in big trouble fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no medium, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the roots are just dangling in this too
by itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Francis calls me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, Hey Gabby, I know it's late,
but we've got an emergency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our airflow, the drain broke off.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not holding water.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're going to lose everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, Oh, well I have an airflow
at my store.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can come and get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I drove over there and met these guys
over there and they, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we opened up the box, get out the part for
the airflow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you decide, well, you know,
since we're here, there's a couple more
[SPEAKER_06]: things that I need.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, sure, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, like I've already made the
trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Might as well sell you some more shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're like grabbing things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want this, I want this, but you're just
holding it in your hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And before we know it, you drop the
airflow part.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this PVC manifold, you know,
like two inch PVC or one and a half inch
[SPEAKER_06]: PVC has all these things on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my floor is cement.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was so heavy because of all the
stuff that was attached to it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it hit the ground that just shattered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like at that point, like your crop was
fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember actually what happened,
but it was like, this is bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like the next day, I think the
next day you went to like Friedman
[SPEAKER_06]: Brothers or something like that and just
got like PVC in a cap and stuck it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like your plants were like not happy
with you for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though it was that moment of
sorrow, that was the moment that I always
[SPEAKER_06]: felt like we connected and became friends
forever at that moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part you didn't know that Sean was
walking and he tripped and he fell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he tripped and fell and he's fucking
dead, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he broke the part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He broke, he broke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had to, we had to,
we had to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, we came like,
we came from hydro world because coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from where we came from, like soil,
working with soil wasn't really like
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment style.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being able to get it up and out of the
apartment and throwing it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was hard, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have, I have funny stories, has nothing
to do with the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you about the first time I
ever grew weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my parents, they helped me get this
apartment and it was in Greenpoint in
[SPEAKER_06]: Brooklyn, which is like a really,
at the time it was like an extremely
[SPEAKER_06]: Polish neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like now it's like super hip.
[SPEAKER_06]: They ran all the old people out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's like young students and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two stops on the L train from
Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're in Brooklyn, but you can be in
Manhattan in less than five minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so it was like, it's an awesome
spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I got this apartment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on the third story of this
Brownstone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on every story, there was two
apartments on the bottom story.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like a card room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a private card room,
but it's old Polish guys that play cards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then on the second story, there was a gay
couple and then like a Polish couple that
[SPEAKER_06]: spoke Polish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero English.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the top story, it was me and
my girlfriend at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, and that lived next to us that
were young.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was growing in this apartment and
just like you said, getting rid of soil
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff and, you know, anything like
that, it was super because you had to put
[SPEAKER_06]: all your trash out on the street,
you know, and if the cops thought you were
[SPEAKER_06]: growing, looking at your trash,
like they don't even need a warrant to do
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's out on the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can just go through it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my toilet, I'm on the third story and
there was so much suction on this toilet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like literally you would not sit on it
when you flushed that toilet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause fucking your balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dangerous up down the pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but I thought I'd take advantage of
this and like, I used to flush everything,
[SPEAKER_06]: the trim, the soil, everything went down
the fucking toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some 90s story right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I thought we should start with
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I mean, I was growing in like two
or three gallon box and at the end of the
[SPEAKER_06]: cop, I would cut the stem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember how we got the stems down
the toilet, but I, I know everything went
[SPEAKER_06]: down the toilet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We must've like grinded up or something
and I would just have this five gallon
[SPEAKER_06]: bucket of soil and I turn it over into the
toilet and then like with a stick,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd fucking just like break it up and like
one flush and we just go straight down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, I did like two or three crops
there before I moved to California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, so one day, you know, the
inevitable day comes where I stick,
[SPEAKER_06]: I stick this five gallon bucket into the
toilet and floods the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that moment I'm like, Oh my God,
like I got to call a plumber and there's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be two crops worth of soil jammed
in these pipes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I'm like, I'm so busted.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like thinking like, I got to cut down
all my shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is, this is fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I like, you know, and the place had
one bathroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a railroad apartment,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one room to the next room,
to the next room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was a kitchen with a shower
right next to it, the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to live in one of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is, this is a bad situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so I run to the hardware store and I
buy a plunger, which I never had because
[SPEAKER_06]: the fucking thing had, you know,
so I buy a plunger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cheeky cheek.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flush it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just fucking goes right down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I continue to flush it down
the toilet because what else the fuck was
[SPEAKER_06]: I going to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally there was nothing to do in New
York city.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's only so many other people's
like dumpsters that you could dump.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's shady too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like trying to put your shit in somebody
else's dumpster or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I lived in New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: I flushed everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I flushed everything down the toilet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to live in a big apartment complex
like that in San Diego and slowly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but surely as people would move out,
I'd rent the next apartment and thought I
[SPEAKER_02]: was being all sneaky, you know,
but they had the same kind of toilets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought to have the ingenuity to
flush the soil though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was the dumbest idea ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, it was kind of,
it was kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the stupid shit that we did on dead tour
that we could still be in jail for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not like, you know, like,
Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, why did I do such stupid shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'd never do that again, you know,
and I would never recommend anyone flush
[SPEAKER_06]: anything, you know, like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got lucky that you moved out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me tell you about, you know,
I lived there for like nine months before
[SPEAKER_06]: I moved to California and did like a few
cycles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's literally my last crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm, I'm cutting my crop and
hanging it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get a knock on the door and I'm
like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's knocking on my door.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lived here for nine months.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one has ever knocked on my door because
you got to get rung in from downstairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only people that look,
you know, like, is the people in the
[SPEAKER_06]: building.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone was super private.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like nobody ever, like nobody
ever said anything to me, even though once
[SPEAKER_06]: you got up to the second story,
you could totally smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just reach probably down the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, who is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so knock on the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like walk up the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like the neighbor's girlfriend,
you know, the girl that lives next door.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, could I have a joint,
please?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I opened the door and I literally grab her
and pull her in to my place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like the way it was is once you're in
my place, you're basically in the girl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, we knew you were growing,
but we had no idea it was like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, they were really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, if I wasn't growing and
paranoid, I would have been friends with
[SPEAKER_06]: them like the whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would have had great neighbors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was literally only meeting them days
before we're leaving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we were harvesting, getting the fuck
out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, she's like, yeah,
obviously we've been smelling it for nine
[SPEAKER_06]: months.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just couldn't take it anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, all right, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, Hey, so do you want to see
mine?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, yeah, she's like, it's nothing
like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, I got some plants over at my
place too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, Oh my God, I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, all right, I'll go and see
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I go over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have no lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just have plants in the window.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like when you're at the bottom of the
street, there's like two windows on every
[SPEAKER_06]: story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like they had pot plants growing in
their window.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like when you go up the stairs,
it like zigzags across.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like if the cops saw the plants in
their window and they come up the stairs,
[SPEAKER_06]: like they would immediately know it's
coming from my door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, you got to get rid of this
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, it was like, not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they weren't going to get
anything from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was like, I, I forget what
time of year it was, but I think we're
[SPEAKER_06]: approaching winter actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, they had these pathetic
plants that were starting to bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, I was like, look, I will give
you weed and I will give you, I'll teach
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys how to grow before I leave.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have to get rid of that shit right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit has to come out of your window
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they, you know, I gave them some
weed and they killed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, really?
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, no, it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just in your window.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't like a south facing good window.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was winter time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had no lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when they left, I left them my gear.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I didn't, you know, I didn't
want to drive across country with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My plan was to get my lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: I left them plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know, when I first started
growing, let me just finish this one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used, I grew from bag seed, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like getting clones, you know,
there wasn't riot seed co at the time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you know, just like everything
else that we had at the time, it came from
[SPEAKER_06]: bag seed and I named every one of my
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: A girl's name.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the one that made it out West,
the one that I saved was called Francine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've heard of that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you had that, you had that pipe
from, from Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you never smoked anything but the
Francine out of, but it was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: My whole collection burned in the fires
and melted.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fire at my house was so hot that the
glass melted.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I found like a, I found a plate
of glass that had like my, used to be my
[SPEAKER_06]: pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had this case that had a bunch,
bunch of different pipe than it from dead
[SPEAKER_00]: tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was this piece that like
was the Francine piece and he only smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: Francine out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when he retired that cut,
cause it rotted, he basically retired
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking out of that piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bubbler, the Francine bubbler,
the Francine bubbler, passion and
[SPEAKER_02]: devotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dig that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just wanting to finish saying about
Francine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a question, Francis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually just going to say,
dude, that, uh, um, I similarly,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was the last place I was in,
when I was growing in Chicago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always super militant about like
walking my dogs and I would try to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: it smelled anywhere and it never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was so clever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this guy knocked on my door and
he was my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, would you mind coming
into my room, coming into my apartment and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's like, I just don't want to
talk to you in the courtyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I walked into his house and it
smelled like someone was actively
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all the smell that I thought I
was so slick on, he's like, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like for about two weeks,
every couple of months, my entire
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment smells like, and my girlfriend
and I weren't convinced it's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was so slick, you know,
and I was, and it didn't smell outside my
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't smell outside the windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caulked everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, so careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it straight reeked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reeked, dude, reeked in his house,
like worse than my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I couldn't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were just pumping it all right next
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had no idea, but apparently it
smelled like someone was harvesting fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked in and I was like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need some, I need some.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I was like so panicked
because yeah, it's like you, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: people understand today the panic of
having a small scene, but not even most of
[SPEAKER_00]: your friends knowing and like you not,
like it just was so sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just felt so sketch, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, when you moved from there,
was that, was that the trip that you
[SPEAKER_00]: basically got to California and your car
caught on fire and you had to move back
[SPEAKER_06]: and forth again?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was the time that I actually made
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the time that you made it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the first time you tried,
right, like your VW bus with opinions or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, like you caught, you caught all
your shit on fire, like basically right as
[SPEAKER_00]: you were getting to California and failed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had, I actually had forgot
about that for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for reminding me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he had the story of like how he was
driving out like hippie style in this VW
[SPEAKER_00]: bus and you had to stop every so often and
like adjust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well that happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had to adjust the points,
but that was when I was driving east.
[SPEAKER_06]: So me and my girlfriend at the time,
we bought this Volkswagen bus on the west
[SPEAKER_06]: coast and we drove it out east.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we drove it out east,
we had to stop like all the time to adjust
[SPEAKER_06]: the points.
[SPEAKER_06]: But her dad was a mechanic and like,
he didn't want us to go, but he's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: all right, if you're going to go,
I'm going to like fix this thing up a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not like stranded in the middle
of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he fixed it up and the whole way
across country, we never had to adjust the
[SPEAKER_06]: points and we were a hundred and 37 miles
from the California border and it stalled.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, Oh, I was, I actually
wasn't even that stressed about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I was like, you know, the last time
when we're driving east, we had to stop
[SPEAKER_06]: every 200 miles and adjust the points.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we just, we just drove almost
3000 miles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was 137 miles from the California
border.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I tried to turn the ignition and it
makes like one little sound like trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: turn over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just stops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look out the mirrors and it was
breathing fire out the, uh, out the vents.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was fire coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like me and my girlfriend,
and I think we had a cat at the time that
[SPEAKER_06]: like we had it like the cat was like,
we had a bed in there and the cat was
[SPEAKER_06]: underneath and we had to like,
try to get the cat out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cat, when the cat got out,
the cat was like under the burning van
[SPEAKER_06]: scared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't want to fucking come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like trying to like, you know,
so that time we had to like go with our
[SPEAKER_06]: heads between our head, you know,
tails and like call our parents to fly us
[SPEAKER_06]: back home.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't make it, but regarding that
story, something that you don't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: Francis, I don't know how interesting this
is to the viewers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last two months ago, my insurance provider
calls me up and they say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_06]: your license has been revoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I haven't even had a ticket in
five years, a year or more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, like they're like, yeah, something
happened in Arizona in 1990 and your
[SPEAKER_06]: license has been revoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what happened was when my van
caught fire, it like literally took an
[SPEAKER_06]: hour for a police department, a police car
to show up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like another hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the fire department to show up by the
time they showed up, it wasn't even on
[SPEAKER_06]: fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like after losing everything we had
and our dreams of making it out,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, out West.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, yeah, I hear you guys fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, after losing everything we owned in
our dreams of going out West to see Jerry,
[SPEAKER_06]: he writes me a ticket for driving with no
insurance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it actually caught up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I never paid the ticket, you know,
fucking 18, you know, 19 year old deadhead
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking making bad decisions, driving
across country with no insurance.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a bad decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of our young viewers out there should
do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like the flushing it down the
toilet, driving across country.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are not recommended.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you know, don't do what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does one fix a ticket like this that
is that old and just, so, so what happened
[SPEAKER_06]: was this was a already like 10 years ago
or more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't renew my license when I tried
to renew it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They told me about the ticket and I paid
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually, now I paid it 10 years late.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like it took, it took a while
for them to track me down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so I paid this fucking ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now I realize I've been driving
around for six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: With no insurance and I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: DMV.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't contact me that they,
you know, revoked my license.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would have gotten into a car
accident.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm going to lose everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no insurance and decision as a kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I called up Arizona DMV and I asked
them what was up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I paid the ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, yeah, but there's an
eight dollar late fee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I paid the ticket, they gave me my
license back, but there was this eight
[SPEAKER_06]: dollar late fee.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, so you mean to tell me you
guys revoked my driver's license for a
[SPEAKER_06]: ticket that I paid because of an eight
dollar late fee that I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, yeah, you know, we're sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, how much do you guys want?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I'm thinking like this
eight dollar late fee is like two thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: dollars now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Compounding interest and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like eight dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, I was actually almost more
offended.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so like over eight dollars that,
you know, I would have paid, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I went to DMV.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, yeah, it's not our
responsibility to tell you that your
[SPEAKER_06]: license has been revoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I was like, so what are you
telling me that I need to check the DMV
[SPEAKER_06]: website every morning when I wake up?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that's the finale of that
Volkswagen story and that failed trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, my memory's fucked up, but there's
certain things that I remember clearly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I may not have the entire chem dog
history down as much as Francis does,
[SPEAKER_06]: but, you know, I haven't lost it all yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've said I've said this before on
the podcast or whatever, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically all the stories that I have
before I came into it come from him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and him and I just sitting
around like people do like like friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and stoners shooting the shit about
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I believe them over
most of the other stories was just because
[SPEAKER_00]: he told them to me so long before it got
famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like when we were growing
the chem dog, like nobody like I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: people the only people that like there was
like a few there was like maybe four
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, like me, him,
skunk, the A and I see like that was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, I mean, it wasn't like
it wasn't famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like any of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any legend to having it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't any reason to embellish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back when I started selling the chem dog,
people would buy it not because they knew
[SPEAKER_06]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like you took one smell of it
and you know that you have never had
[SPEAKER_06]: anything like that before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, new people would just be
instantly ready to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I remember for whatever price,
if I remember what you were telling me,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, probably the best place to get chem
dogs was outside of a Jerry Band show at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Warfield or somewhere like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I really, I didn't have to go far
to sell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the only people that were
getting the chem dog were friends of mine
[SPEAKER_06]: and friends of mine would beg me to sell
it all to them just so that they could
[SPEAKER_06]: sell it to their friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you couldn't, no one else could make
money on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was selling this shit for 400.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think skunk VA, he might have made some
money on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I was selling this shit for
400 bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like people were like, fine,
I'll buy a pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, at the time I would only harvest
three or four pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's three months to the
next crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd be fine just selling the weed over
that three to four months with as much
[SPEAKER_06]: money as I could.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, back then I was getting,
you know, 400 bucks an ounce, 6,400
[SPEAKER_06]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it started off with friends
just buying an ounce and then they would
[SPEAKER_06]: be like, yeah, you know, I'll just buy the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I told the story about how me and
not so dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I shared the story about how not so dog
and I met.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to share the stories,
what I can remember of how skunk VA and I
[SPEAKER_06]: met and how Klopp and I met.
[SPEAKER_06]: So start with skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_06]: I moved to California, you know,
after that apartment, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: where my neighbor friends asked me for
some weed just before I left.
[SPEAKER_06]: We successfully made it out to Cali and
rented this house.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a little cottage in the
backyard where we turned one of the rooms
[SPEAKER_06]: into a grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we had six 600 watt lights,
total of 3600 watts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, coming from a place where,
you know, when I left Staten Island,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that was, I think it was less
than that, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: people were growing with fluorescent
lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, and, you know, if you get three
pounds and you're getting 6,400 a pound,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's decent.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, you know, like you can,
you're a baller.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So back then it was way easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but because I was so paranoid,
I never wanted to sell weed to people
[SPEAKER_06]: around, like around, like where I live.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was relying heavily on Grateful
Dead, Jerry Garcia.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when, I had a crop come down and they
weren't playing, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was rare, but, you know, every now and
again, there was a month or so where there
[SPEAKER_06]: was nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, so I went to Golden Gate
Park to the Panhandle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, this was before I had the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I met Jason down in the Panhandle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like was like, Hey, you know,
I've got some time, but I want to sell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, he was living out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's how we became
friends, is I offered him some of my
[SPEAKER_06]: homegrown in the Panhandle of Golden Gate
Park, like the shadiest drug dealing part
[SPEAKER_06]: of Golden Gate Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after that, like he started doing
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was growing like random seeds,
you know, seed growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some Francine, but, you know,
there was some good stuff, but it was,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, probably it was actually today,
I would appreciate it more.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I had some stuff that had a lot
of sativa in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, but it was hard to grow,
particularly when you're not the best
[SPEAKER_06]: grower and these things are getting big.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then when you would smoke it,
you would get that sativa Terps to be
[SPEAKER_06]: like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like it was impressive.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm sure skunk VA would remember
the strain names.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really remember anymore what it
was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't chem dog or sour or super skunk,
anything on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing that carried on too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might've been, I might've taken home
some RFK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, from club.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to talk more with you
about that after we go over club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I believe at the time, like he's
just a traveling hippie and he eventually
[SPEAKER_06]: gets a, we did many transactions.
[SPEAKER_06]: He helped me sell a lot of my weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then eventually he moved up to Sonoma
County and you know, I taught him how to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you were telling me that he
credits someone else's being his mentor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you said?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was the person that he got
the Virginia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was more of a, like,
I think I remember him telling me about
[SPEAKER_06]: this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was more like a mentor on a
personal level.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was the one that first
introduced him to growing really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure if Jason tells different,
he's correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause his memory is like so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yeah, you know, I met Jason like
that or skunked VA and he, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we became super tight and
partners in a grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: He grew the chem dog and then he,
uh, he eventually became partners with Ben
[SPEAKER_06]: in a grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's how Ben or, uh, I see
collective.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but yeah, like I've been friends with
those guys now since Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's one thing that I wanted to
say, like you got a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_06]: timeline wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually got, so Jason, excuse me,
skunked VA, I don't even know how he wants
[SPEAKER_06]: to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, he, uh, we used to go see Jerry
together at the Warfield.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, you know, the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had a friend that came from New
York, not New York, uh, from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he saw the chem dog and he really
wanted the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jason was really, and he had some,
uh, wasn't it the Francine he wanted?
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I didn't even have the chem dog yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted the Francine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even have the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying, I'm trying to remember,
like I'm surprised that he wanted the
[SPEAKER_06]: Francine that bad that he was able,
that I was able to get skunked for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't exactly remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do remember some trade was made.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met him and picked up the, uh,
the skunk cut, the VA skunk, which is not
[SPEAKER_06]: the super skunk, but it's definitely some
skunky weed, probably a cross of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Greg wanted this cut or chem dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Greg would never give up the chem dog
until I had this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he wanted this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he was willing to trade it to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He asked that I not like really spread it
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the only people that I ever really gave
it to were people that I was working with.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the much shorter story of how I
got the chem dog from Greg.
[SPEAKER_06]: We traded for that skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the part of the story that I like to
tell is I drove across country and I had
[SPEAKER_06]: it in a like Burger King cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was like in a, you know,
two inch Oasis cube or something like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a growing, it was a growing
cutting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, if there was a trucker coming
by, I just like put the cap on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if I was like running into a gas
station or something, I just put the cap
[SPEAKER_06]: on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I drove the chem dog across country,
um, in like two Burger King cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I had one probably that had
like a couple of chem dog cuts and another
[SPEAKER_06]: one that had the skunk cuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and you said, in the video that I
didn't want the other cut that he had,
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably was just already like,
how the fuck am I going to get any of
[SPEAKER_06]: these cuts on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like with a couple of chem dogs and a
couple of these skunks, it was already
[SPEAKER_06]: like an ambitious thing to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you know how to smoke 10
joints every day, driving fucking through
[SPEAKER_06]: Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do that shit people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these days people use the mail and
stuff, but homing straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he drove all the way from the West
coast back East and then back again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it's like using the mail,
using the mail wasn't an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a no go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it was, it was an entire
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a massive journey to get there and
back again.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so I'll take a step in reverse
and tell you, cause I met Klopp first.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Klopp, he should be called Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though he lives in Jersey now,
but still he's more Staten Island,
[SPEAKER_06]: like than any of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is another girlfriend that I had,
like we were like, we had just come back
[SPEAKER_06]: from the Grateful Dead shows to Staten
Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we took a train and like home and we
were just sitting on the street in front
[SPEAKER_06]: of his house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he didn't live in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he lived on a really busy street
right next to the train and it was like
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses and his house is like up,
you know, like on a second story above
[SPEAKER_06]: some business or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, Hey, what are you,
what are you guys doing down there smoking
[SPEAKER_06]: weed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause of course we were.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how I met Klopp was one day,
like me and my girlfriend was sitting on
[SPEAKER_06]: the street smoking weed and he called us
up into his place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at this point he had never grown weed,
but like we showed him kind bud and it was
[SPEAKER_06]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, he was like, you can grow
weed like this in your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, yeah, that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like, I'm not going to say,
um, uh, his mentor or anything,
[SPEAKER_06]: cause he did everything by himself,
but like, I inspired him at that moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: He like immediately went, I'll never
forget.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a 10 gallon fish tank and he put
some dirt on the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he planted some seeds and they
sprouted and his cat fucking dug them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that so many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: His cat, his cat dug them up, but he
eventually like, he did it again and he
[SPEAKER_06]: put some plants in a closet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like maybe a two foot deep by six
foot long closet, um, with like shop
[SPEAKER_06]: lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the first cannabis that I
ever saw grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had gotten, you know, beautiful kind
bud in California and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a dead show.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I had never seen it grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even, even though it was under
fluorescent lights, he was able to harvest
[SPEAKER_06]: weed in a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was kind of the inspiration for
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, at that point I was like,
I got to do this, you know, and that's so,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know, obviously after,
you know, doing all right, he eventually
[SPEAKER_06]: moved out of that place, gotten other
places, started growing with some real
[SPEAKER_06]: lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't always grow with the shop
lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, and I mean, we talked about the
RFK a little bit privately.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to some Grateful Dead shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the story is similar to the chem
dog story, but didn't turn out quite as
[SPEAKER_06]: famous, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he bought some flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the dead show, found a couple of seeds,
planted them, and he got the RFK number
[SPEAKER_06]: one, two, and three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's three different ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: How different were they, do you remember?
[SPEAKER_06]: They were very different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Different enough that he would keep them
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder which one is still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little embarrassed because,
you know, my memory isn't as good as
[SPEAKER_06]: Francis's or Skunk VA or Klopp,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all, they all have their piece of the
story and, you know, everything that I've
[SPEAKER_06]: heard has been accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I haven't, I haven't heard,
you know, there's some like little details
[SPEAKER_06]: that really, it's more about personal
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one thing that I have no evidence
to, but I'd like to bring this up for
[SPEAKER_06]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really believe, and I hate to just
call people out, but I'm going to do it
[SPEAKER_06]: right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe that Greg had these seeds
from the same batch five or so years
[SPEAKER_06]: later.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when he was germinating them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like those later seeds were something
else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, like he's even said it before
that like the chem dog is whatever he's
[SPEAKER_06]: growing at that moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I don't think just because
think about it from his perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just popped a couple of seeds and
pulled the most amazing chem dog ever,
[SPEAKER_06]: are you going to wait five years to plant
more of them and then five years more to
[SPEAKER_06]: plant the rest?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, you know, yeah,
the logic's never worked out.
[SPEAKER_06]: With, yeah, with poor like knowledge on
how to save the seeds, like the seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: probably would have been no good five
years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was seeking seeds in fridges.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of, that part of the story,
even, you know, I would question that,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that wasn't even any part of the story
that I had anything to do with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you interact with the Chem D?
[SPEAKER_02]: When did that come around?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we never had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so here's he did not because let's
just say I could tell this part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: story, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to be a bit at times,
I used to be a bit of a bridge between
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk VA and Gabby here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they had some battles and stuff
like that back and forth, but he would
[SPEAKER_00]: still come to Gabby's shop to buy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this thing where he had
gotten online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was an 06 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had gotten online and he had started
talking about the chem on the forums for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time, which is where the whole
Skunk VA moniker and all that started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at that point, Chem Dog himself
had not had the actual Chem Dog for some
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wanted it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Chem Dog told us, if you bring me
the Chem Dog, I'll give you this new chem
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Skunk VA ended up flying out to back
east or something with the Chem Dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, giving it to giving it to Dude
and Dude gave D and he brought it back and
[SPEAKER_00]: he gave it to IC Collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IC Collective then gave it to me after
they'd bombed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point in 06, you know,
Gabby was doing so well with the shop and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd kind of taken a that was the
beginning of your kind of hiatus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from collecting cuts and having
that whole thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the shop was really booming then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was, you know, so the Chem D
came around, you know, kind of after after
[SPEAKER_00]: he had, I guess you could say,
retired for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually I never liked the Chem D nearly
as much as everyone else.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know, like I just, you know,
and that's part of, you know, why I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: saying is your for me is the original Chem
Dog and then there's everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, dude, you might you might have
you might have you probably lost this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't remember everything in the early
in the very early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had that you had this really nice
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we remember we did that little like
mini greenhouse rip of the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: My and my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My avatar on IG is I still have like eight
by eleven and a half photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to share that with me,
bro, that you I will that you print it out
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my avatar is actually a picture of
that stuff that you and I grew together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two thousand two or something on it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking about are we talking about
the greenhouse, like the bigger greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: or the small?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the little one in your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little not the bigger one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little one in your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, you know, he just cut out
there for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what people should realize is that,
like with these stories and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've acquired knowledge pretty
well at this point, and it's pretty easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to like get started and learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in the early and mid 90s and
throughout the 90s, really, knowledge was
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people had some pretty hokey setups in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just because you're trying to
get started, you're trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much there's not, you know,
there's not growth stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not people there that'll help you
get set up or learn or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not as easy to find grow
books either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like unless you have high times of risking
your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I first moved to California,
the first little bit I was there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was like, you know,
going to I had to go to Berkeley from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo, which was a two and a half hour
drive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Gabby worked at the first
store that opened up in Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I only had to drive an hour and ten
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so people know, it's like the stories
that I tell are like what I remember from
[SPEAKER_00]: him telling me this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was telling me all these stories,
you know, 20 plus, you know, over 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I mean, I don't think chem
started to become famous or like well
[SPEAKER_00]: known as far as to like the Kana community
until probably like 06, 07 ish when Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: VA got online and started really telling
the story to a wider audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for, I don't know, years, it was
literally like, at least on the West Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: group of us, it was Gabby and Skunk VA and
myself and IC collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were pretty much like the only
people that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's how they kept the cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he kind of talked about how,
you know, he was told to keep it close and
[SPEAKER_02]: he didn't want to be considered stingy
with it per se, but he wanted to keep his
[SPEAKER_02]: word, you know, to whoever he had got it
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, it sounds like it was
kept pretty, pretty tight in those
[SPEAKER_02]: circles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would have been hard for that to
proliferate the culture at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't, it didn't leak really out of
our tiny little group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, really like when it comes down
to it, like, like dude said, it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't even like he gave it to like
random people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally like the people that were
closest to him that he was actively like
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and partnering and doing things
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of, when you, when you,
when you have like these grow
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships, if people don't know,
like you're sharing your library as you're
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have every opportunity to take
cuts if they want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of go into it with the mindset
that like, what I'm sharing is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we have this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I don't know if people know
this, but I'll just say it anyway is that
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when most famous people tell
stories, um, you know, can a famous or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly me, not that I'm famous,
but like certainly me, but I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: almost everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when they tell the story,
it's almost always a collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost always some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a collection of homies doing
stuff together, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that sometimes depending on
the ego of the person either gets included
[SPEAKER_00]: or left out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but like a lot, a lot of times
people think, Oh, you know, I was in my
[SPEAKER_00]: basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was all by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody even knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's like just, that's not really how,
how weed growing worked in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like your best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of had everything you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were helping each other, keep things
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, the, the dog got lost in our
crew by individuals numerous times,
[SPEAKER_00]: just never all four of us at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, and so it's like,
I try to be, you know, I don't want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't ever want to get accused
of like, you know, writing people out or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, but sometimes I don't
mention it just because like I'm worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about their privacy or maybe they've gone
on to do something else or maybe they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a career or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't the most conducive to like
talking publicly about weed stories or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in this case, Gabby, he,
and we talked about this off air.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just, he just didn't want to insert
himself into the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He felt like he didn't do enough to
warrant having like some big place in some
[SPEAKER_02]: story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a big ego flex for him on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crazy thing to me as far as I'm aware,
and this is just probably raw,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I don't think anyone would have the
cut if he hadn't brought it West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because what it seems to be is that,
and I was talking about this even with
[SPEAKER_00]: some like pretty unknown, you can call
them chem fam or whatever, but people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very close to chem dog and have been
in that little circle for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it got lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original cut got lost back East.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it, it survived in this
little, teeny circle that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that regard, the only, you know,
he can say he's not important,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but like, if he hadn't brought
it out to us, then nobody would have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, by even further extension,
had he not shown clop that weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: we wouldn't have sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, there's all kinds of,
yeah, there's all, I mean, there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's like, you can be, you know,
I, I, I joke or, or whatever about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, uh, being in the forest,
being forest gump and like stumbling
[SPEAKER_00]: around like an idiot while like fame,
like important things happen around me or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some points in time, I think
everyone has a little bit of that where
[SPEAKER_00]: like, no one, no, no one knew any of these
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many 17 year old kids have,
have, you know, how many young kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many young hippies have cracked seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Gabby was talking about, and nothing
ever came of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of it too is like,
you have differing memories from people
[SPEAKER_00]: and nobody had any idea that like everyone
was going to like parse every single
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping little tidbits will bubble up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were just talking, we were just
talking Gabby about, um, about how you
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking offline, about how you didn't
want to interject yourself into the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was kind of saying, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember when, what part of
it we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just chem dog in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, I was basically saying that
like, if I don't think if you hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it West, I don't think anybody
would know what it is because it in our
[SPEAKER_00]: little group.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much credit, how much credit,
how much credit do we give the postman for
[SPEAKER_06]: delivering our shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like in the end, it's just like,
you know, and while you were gone,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I think I'm part, I think I'm
part of the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but like, you know, what I
wanted to be my legacy was the not so dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I was working on it,
you know, I was working on, or Francis and
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, we were working on doing some
breeding to make the next thing that was
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be, you know, better than the
dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I think we failed terribly
and, um, that's Brady.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, it was hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, my fail failed terribly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually made some really awesome
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just weren't what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't hit the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were going for, we were trying to get,
you know, chem and chem crosses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to me, nothing that we did was
actually dog luck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like the sour was stronger on
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, like we could keep crossing
it back to the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just, I was never satisfied with
what, what we had gotten.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think it was just like in the
beginning phases of, of the project,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, of breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's interesting about that is that
the name not so dog strains called the N S
[SPEAKER_06]: D not so dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would be like, N S D one,
two, three, four, five, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and because they were never dog like
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I say like, you know,
I think I'm part of the story and I,
[SPEAKER_06]: I met people that, you know, we were all
together at this time, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so, I mean, like you didn't really go into
detail on sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned meeting clock,
but when people may not know by extension
[SPEAKER_02]: is that Klopp is the sour guy,
the diesel guy, you know, and honestly,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's why, that's why when we were
talking about it, when we were talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about it, about the, the AJ sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that that was the stuff that
came from Klopp, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, maybe they, you know,
had rejuvenated it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, made some, but I think I
thought that that's where the stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: originally came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do like the story that Francis was
telling about it being accidental.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, that's, that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I think it was all true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't like come on the show and say,
Francis, you were wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got that completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of it seemed pretty right up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did though, you could, you could
say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it does get, it does get
interesting when you talk to different
[SPEAKER_00]: people, because one of the things that
Matt and I have learned is that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: take 20 year old memories and you start
comparing them, what people remember and
[SPEAKER_00]: what stands out and like what there could
be some, some variations that they
[SPEAKER_00]: remember things a little different,
like, you know, the, the NSD or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole reason why I came up with that
name was because I was trying to join IG
[SPEAKER_00]: and every name I came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rejected I'll tell a story for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this time where, because there
was only like four of us that had the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times Gabby would go and he would
buy some dog off whoever had it the
[SPEAKER_00]: freshest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time our buddy, I see
collective was living in Tahoe and Gabby
[SPEAKER_00]: went up to Tahoe and got some dogs and he
came back and I remember going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he picked me up and we were,
it was outside of Willett's, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little town in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, dude, I want you to see
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, so I'm in the dark and I opened
this bag and I stick my head in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, dude, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it doesn't remind me of the
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so, it's not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, it looks so frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I think it's a different
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that I see had been
partying a little bit and there must have
[SPEAKER_00]: been some kind of like strain mix up or
label mistake or he won't screw up on some
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he filled his entire room with what he
thought was the dog and it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like remembered that it was like
this random joke, not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I popped it into the IG and it
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, well, I guess that's
my handle, you know, but what we were
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to, I also named our seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also named our clones, not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, remember the labels and that is
the one, two, three, four, five,
[SPEAKER_06]: and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, what we were trying to do is we were
trying to get like the power and the
[SPEAKER_00]: density of the dog in the same strain as
like the, we wanted like the frost of the
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk and like the stink and some of the
perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop going to get confusing frost of the
skunk or the super skunk, which came West
[SPEAKER_02]: Gabby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's something that we.
[SPEAKER_06]: The super skunk from sensey seeds is the
one that was white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could, that could veer us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could veer us off because,
so I had, I, I think I might, and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've been operating under a
misconception for a really long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when, when you, and in that era when
we met and you gave me the dog and you
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me the skunk, did you give me the va
skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you give me a different skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty sure that you had given me
the VA skunk because when we grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: together, all those times, you would tell
me the story and you would never be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I lost that one, but I have this
different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was the skunk and then there
was the super skunk from sensey seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did buy some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one would you compare to the
book?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one in the catalog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was the super skunk from sensey
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was telling you the story that
you would look at the picture,
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd look at the picture and hold it up
next to your buds and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we would get Gabby had original
copies of Neville's, Neville's catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby had original copies of Neville's
catalogs and like, we would clip off when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were gardening together, we would clip
off side nugs off, off skunk and hold it
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gabby would be like, yep, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would look exactly like to the T
what was on that picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did the VA skunk look exactly like the
one in the catalog?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: How uniform the shit was and exact.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you pop, it was the only time
ever in the history of the universe that
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody pops a seed and gets exactly what
they're expecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was like, why would I keep all
10 of them when this one is exactly what
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wanting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so there was the seed grown sensey
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was the VA, the,
the clone that we picked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I don't know is what, you know,
is what I got from you at your house in
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it when I got in trouble and I
didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that, at that time, that was like
the Kush sour diesel era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, nobody was interested in
old cuts and it was really hard to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff backed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been hunting it for a million
years and I pull on strings.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would still like to have the original
sensey super skull.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you could put that shit next to
any weed today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it had the look,
had the nose is pretty much perfectly as
[SPEAKER_06]: close as you can get to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one thing I disagreed with you
about on the podcast was when you were
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about, you know, all about the
potency.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree that it was some of the most
potent weed of its time, but what made the
[SPEAKER_06]: chem dog amazing was the terp profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I wanted out of the
breeding project was to get, because I
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to get some bigger and because the
chem dog was such a hurting plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think the way you described it
was accurate, Matt.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said the plant would consume itself
before you'd finish it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was just trying to finish and
still have a green leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like, you know, like it's two weeks to
go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is yellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like this plant is dying.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was, it was a difficult plant
to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we didn't have the resources that we
did to today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like if I was growing the chem
dog, today, I would definitely do leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: tissue analysis, you know, during the crop
to see what it's taking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because that's smart back in the day,
we were guessing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we didn't have these resources and
we were failing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the funny part, you know,
now the chem dog grown to a point where
[SPEAKER_06]: it's going to die was still better than
all the other weed out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would do this thing where he was fully
organic when we met and I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wouldn't call it chem dog because
he's like, I grow organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to call my weed chem,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there would be this funny thing
where he'd look at me and he goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does like GH three part and it
won't eat itself quite as much if you feed
[SPEAKER_00]: it that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because that's what Greg was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people were doing like when I was
organic, I never had done the hydro,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so I'll tell this part of the story
briefly.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is part of the story that I like to
tell is, you know, Greg called it the chem
[SPEAKER_06]: dog and he specifically told me you have
to grow this one chem because it's so hard
[SPEAKER_06]: to feed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll never get a successful crop out of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you try to grow it organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, that was like a challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, well, I'm definitely not going
to grow it using hydro, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And man, I used to do so much trying to
feed my plants indoors, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: with organics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I not only had like guano teas,
but I used to make like vegetable scrap
[SPEAKER_06]: teas and all this nasty, like anaerobic
shit going on, like smelled so bad and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, doing whatever I could trying to
feed my plants organically.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one day I read on the back of this
flyer from a hydro nutrient company,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was a actually a green air products.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a hydro nutrient that never was
successful, but on the back of the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: thing and they were explaining what's the
difference between organic and inorganic.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, so inorganic is minerals
and organics are minerals, mineral
[SPEAKER_06]: compounds that are held together by carbon
and that they need to be broken down into
[SPEAKER_06]: their more mineral form for the plant to
uptake it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it says the minerals are the
building blocks of all life on the planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it was like a moment for me
when a light switch went on and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: like, oh, maybe I need to try this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did, you know, and I don't think it
was the GH3 part at first.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even think that shit existed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was like a general
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had like a three part powder,
like a micro and then the grow of the
[SPEAKER_06]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, but the first time I fed my
plants, hydro nutrients, even in like a
[SPEAKER_06]: cocoa or peat moss type stuff,
you know, and what I did and what I still
[SPEAKER_06]: believe to this day is the best is using
mineral nutrients and adding some organics
[SPEAKER_06]: that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're giving the plant
everything that it needs, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can give it some things that
it appreciates and a little humility,
[SPEAKER_06]: not thinking like we know plants only need
16 elements.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, now we know when we give
the plant silica, they benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may not die without it, but if you're
trying to get the highest quality product,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's helpful, you know, when you can use
properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, that's what I try to do is
use minerals, add some organic additives,
[SPEAKER_06]: compost tea, you know, when you can do
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I think you get the best
quality and quality and quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing that I'll say is,
and I'm going to have to let you guys go
[SPEAKER_06]: in a few minutes, but I can finish with
this part is a lot of people think they're
[SPEAKER_06]: growing organic because they have a like
hundred gallon smart pot filled with ocean
[SPEAKER_06]: forest soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I give give it just water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they think that their product is
superior because they didn't use any
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just because they made it to harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't think if I think if
you're growing in a container and you're
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to grow organically.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're kidding yourself if you
think that you're getting the best,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the most nutritious food out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most nutritious medicinal product out of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, to take that to the next part is I
think the best medicine or food will be
[SPEAKER_06]: grown in the ground with soil that's been
nurtured and loved.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't become an organic snob to like
somebody that instantly went full on cam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I think, you know,
if you nurture the land, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can grow the most amazing product
directly in ground.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have to go, we can
continue it tomorrow, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell one super quick story,
which is Gabby had gone to the Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Country Fair for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he used to work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we became really good friends,
he brought me up there a number of years
[SPEAKER_00]: and I worked the crews that he was already
part of.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's outside of Eugene or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was like the heart of organic
weed growing land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would come up there with like my
hydro super skunk and my hydro chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: my hydro Mendo P and super dog that Gabby
and I had made together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like the only one there with
salt weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all like, salt is terrible,
only cheating, evil, bad people use salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would be like, but this weed
is the thing these guys have amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so we were like teaching
each other because they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we would just like they were mixing
all their soil and like in like cement
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breed Your Cynicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene, researching everything
from cannabis strain history, old
[SPEAKER_02]: smuggling tales from the first person
perspective to breeding science and news
[SPEAKER_02]: on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_02]: not so dog breeder and grower from
Mendocino to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start writing some wrongs.
