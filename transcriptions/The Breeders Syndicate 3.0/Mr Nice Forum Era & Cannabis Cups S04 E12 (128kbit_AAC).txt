[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who live here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dogs, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a little spotlight on my
old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to talk about the,
I think, the return of Neville era when it
[SPEAKER_02]: was Mr. Nice 2009 to 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a full two years,
but it was in there in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also thought, too, that maybe we could
do a little question and answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's a lot better at reading comments
and does a lot more cultivating over there
[SPEAKER_00]: than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ask away, you know, and maybe it might
get answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were chatting a couple of weeks
ago, sort of about that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of stuff that started
happening at Mr. Nice, because it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: new forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of old timers and
heavy hitters started showing up and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a whole lot of what we know,
you know, from the 80s or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early 90s, kind of got talked about
extensively by the people 10 years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of what we reference is like
their own words comes from that era that
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was kind of cool when Neville
popped back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already on the forum and it was it
was kind of unexpected.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden he was there and answering
questions and it was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the guy that we all kind of
looked up to most most people that start
[SPEAKER_02]: selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he was the dude a lot of us looked
up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were finally able to ask him
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had questions about certain things and
he was more than willing to answer
[SPEAKER_02]: questions now, whether or not we got the
most direct true answers is is still to be
[SPEAKER_02]: debated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a lot of them were very,
very helpful and informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: People said Mr. Nice was Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice's website is still up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forum is still active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not nearly as active as the era we're
going to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it it definitely still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti Baba and Neville had a business
relationship that went on for quite some
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used Howard Marks likeness and
name, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after after Neville left Sensei,
he partnered in some fashion with Shanti
[SPEAKER_00]: and that led to a partnership with
Greenhouse and Arjun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when when Shanti and Neville left
Arjun and Greenhouse, they went off and
[SPEAKER_00]: did Mr. Nice in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was primarily Shanti at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Howard Marks and Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never I never saw Howard Marks have much
to do with anything at Mr. Nice when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was, you know, really active.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think he just owned a part of it
because they used his likeness and name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think they I think he had a cool
name and I think they used him as you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, he had a very photogenic story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was sort of at the part in a time
in his life that selling his story was a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his wife had a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a movie a lot of people haven't
seen that was released in the UK called
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually it was it was decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was decent about Howard Marks life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the the autobiography is
fantastic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and just for people that are
listening or whatever, he bought
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's identity in England in the in
the 60s who never really traveled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually pronounced French like
Mr. Nice, like nice friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like you're going to Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually that's how it was
pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he changed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just changed it to Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same spelling, just different,
you know, just different connotation or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because back then, at least he says in the
book, you know, he bought multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: different people's identities who were
never planning on leaving Great Britain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that he could have different passports
and different identities to go around to
[SPEAKER_00]: all these countries and get away with all
this smuggle pre internet days were
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking bomb before they could check out
all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in a way, Mr. Nice was kind of
a cool seed company because it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: legendary old smuggler of hashish and
marijuana and to, you know, and Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: and Shanti.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of like a sort of a
superstar collective, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of weed legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, Mr. Nice, I can't honestly
say that Neville was a part of Mr. Nice at
[SPEAKER_02]: any point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, you know, he sold Shanti a good
deal of his genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were his actual genetics when he
was having legal troubles, I believe,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that came later, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do think is that I think Howard
Marks and Neville had a piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, because when Neville
came back, one of the main things and
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll talk about this more in detail,
he he was really pissed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was pissed that Shanti only ever paid
him $250,000 for those genetics when he
[SPEAKER_02]: needed that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he felt that he was owed a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he didn't have a piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: He felt he was owed a lot more because
Shanti had made a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we should get before we get ahead
of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I think you're talking about
before is like when he was in Australia in
[SPEAKER_00]: the clink, how he got out was the drunkers
bought his business.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's had given 250 grand was his
quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that we know Shanti Baba
had access to a bunch of this old shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that he claims to have is because Neville
told us that he sold him his entire old
[SPEAKER_00]: seed collection for a quarter of a million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's verification.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people claim they have old
things, but how they got them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chain of command, the chain of custody
is a little suspect, a little dubious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Shanti for all of his claims,
you know, his his his origin story is
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that he at least had access to
these genetics at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question is, is more of how
many of them does he still have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus did he ever have access?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know he had access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville gave him a bunch of their
collection when they were working together
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the super silver haze, mango haze,
Neville's haze thing and the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point he sold him his
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of what, you know, a lot of what
is sold at Mr. Nice has claimed to have
[SPEAKER_00]: come from old Neville seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a bit of the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of it except for the widow
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The widow stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it all sort of originates from
clones or old seeds from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's corroborated by Neville said
that, you know, he he sold them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think part of the problem,
part of the interesting parts of people is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be what Neville said.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville is one of those people that it
seems like every five or six years,
[SPEAKER_00]: his life burned down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though he was one of the
originators and everybody grows his shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't end up like Arjun or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't end up filthy rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, technically, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, for most of his life, he was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure Mozart looks down and
thinks how many other people made money
[SPEAKER_00]: off his music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he died a pauper in a dirt grave,
you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Neville was pissed that he
felt like he he started he started the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement and he's the one that exploded
the Dutch scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ended up going to prison and being
chased by the DEA and having all these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody else was profiting off
things hugely that he wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of him ending up being
like, you know, a Ford or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Henry Ford type of thing, you know,
actually, it's more like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like he was the Tesla, not Edison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he did a ton of stuff
and we're all indebted to him in various
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you know, there's the the
Sensi era and the greenhouse era and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he had a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was cool is that when Mr. Nice
set up his forum, when Chauncey set up the
[SPEAKER_00]: forum, there was a bunch of forums at the
time, obviously, that can speak to them
[SPEAKER_00]: more than I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened is when Neville decided
I'm going to come out of the shadows and
[SPEAKER_00]: start answering questions on only Mr.
Nice's forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that basically did this thing where
all of a sudden all this stuff we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: debating forever, you could fucking ask
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: The part that I found the most interesting
and because like some of this is missing
[SPEAKER_02]: now, like a lot of the back and forth was
during this time when he popped up,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was almost a gang war between the icy
maggers that were like Sam the Skunk Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to I was going to bring that
up that basically like an enormous amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of old timers started popping up at Mr.
Nice and adding color and adding depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And corroboration to various stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was a camp at there was
like the Neville camp at Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like the Dave Watson Sam
Skunk Man thing at ICMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they took pot shots at each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were epic videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used it was an old website called
JibJab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could do these Kung Fu like videos
and you could put what the text says,
[SPEAKER_02]: like write what text you want it in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And him and Neville would go back and Sam
or maybe like Cash Rock, someone that was
[SPEAKER_02]: friends with Sam would do the half of it
from Sam's point of view, like talking
[SPEAKER_02]: shit about Neville and these Kung Fu
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Neville would have one of us
write something funny, talking shit back
[SPEAKER_02]: at the ICMA guys and Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think those videos exist
anymore, but they were fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what's interesting about that is
that for all of those battles,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not really all that much that Sam
and Neville disagree on.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they back up each other's
stories quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they both agree that, you know,
Neville got haze from Sam.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam, I think, has told three or four
different stories about exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville has been pretty consistent or was
pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what what had happened, he had one
version and he just kind of stuck to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if he if he had a version,
he stuck to it, whether it was true or
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucking stuck to that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it becomes hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we and one of the one of the
reasons why we wanted to chat about this
[SPEAKER_00]: is because it relates to so much different
stuff today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of those rare times where,
you know, Matt Nye and friends and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still refer back to tons of those
posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Neville explained in detail what
he was up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the funny things about Neville
is that not to say that not to say that he
[SPEAKER_00]: always told the truth or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because he was first, he was a lot
more open than almost anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just saying not only what his hybrids
were, but who he got them from and how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where after Neville, everybody started to
clam up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mysteries of even what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where where they got whatever they
used from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think Neville realized pretty
early on that despite people having the
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe or knowing what strains were and
what, that there was no way they were
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be able to reproduce any of the
phenotypes or anything that he was showing
[SPEAKER_02]: or selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew really early on that that wasn't
going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was no reason to to hide a lot of
the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though I do personally, one of my
theories, I think he he hid quite a few
[SPEAKER_02]: things on and lied about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just saw a comment that I'll just
interject real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a I have an old buddy of mine that
just commented that he got some old
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought home when I when I had
brought home some haze from Europe one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these times and I was testing them out at
my house, you know, and he had like this
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 by 10 space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a big garden in his backyard in
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had this space that was unused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, dude, you want to give me
some heads?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this section of the bed I didn't
fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give me some head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him I gave him like four or five of
these haze plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In July.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now you got to realize like the whole
back of the thing is full of six foot
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, sour diesels, all kinds of different
strains, big bushy strains been in there
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him like four clones this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fast forward two and a half months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things are four feet above.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of his fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took up the whole 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he ended up cutting them down
around Thanksgiving and they weren't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was killer weed, though, even though it
needed probably another two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we we tried out these four little
clones and they turned into this ginormous
[SPEAKER_00]: jungle weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that cold can be that I that I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was one of those ones you could
flower as a seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be fucking eight,
nine feet tall, just candelabra style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just it was funny,
too, because like the way is the way his
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard went, it like slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really could never see
anything, even if he grew huge plants back
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I came over and there's like
these giant branches poking up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: fence where you'd never seen them before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just got to the point where that
thing was going to it was growing eight
[SPEAKER_00]: inches a day in every direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just like exponentially like,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's wild to watch how quick it can
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but so what you know, one of the
things is that when we talk like about a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the when we did a bunch of the
podcasts on like the Neville era and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Bank era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what we say, you know,
comes from that later time nuance and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that Neville answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions, you know, in at the Mr.
Nice era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that also did things where it
brought some people out of the woodwork
[SPEAKER_00]: like some some pretty big people in Europe
were commenting on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ortega popped in and started
commenting on what he had given Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: and what Neville had given him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden, you're watching a
bunch of these like old school legends
[SPEAKER_00]: that started it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're chatting back and forth about
what what they did for each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's what's amazing with that is you
always wonder when you only have one
[SPEAKER_00]: person telling a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do you how do you
corroborate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make sure it's true?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you weed out the bullshit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then all of a sudden you get
two or three people talking about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and you know who they all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, OK, well, that's you
know, yeah, it's probably about as good as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so yeah, so Neville,
Neville just openly discussed all the
[SPEAKER_00]: parentage of all his strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't really have any mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he discussed how and where he got all
the breeding material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was probably the last person to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to this day, like some of the
second round of stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like TH seeds or serious seeds or,
you know, some of those kind of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still mysteries that 25 years
later, we have no idea what the parents
[SPEAKER_02]: were or where they got paradise seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why won't you tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all the all the all the second
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was just like, here's I mean,
like to the point where like we confirmed
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, he went back to America
and he got G 13 and the Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Plant from two grower friends of
Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he paid 500 bucks for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our our our buddy, Greg,
who old Marine, who, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt interviewed, you know, they laid out
the NL story back and forth, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big time and cleared up a bunch of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, oh, I got the I got the
Northern Lights from this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got these two cuts from this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this from every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got these things from Sam Scuttman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the crosses of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it made it like it made it pretty
cool for historians or whatever to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just asked about the mango and the
SSH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get we can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it made it really cool to figure all
that stuff out because he gave the layers
[SPEAKER_00]: where all the second wave of of of
Amsterdam seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rarely tell you what the
parents were.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rarely tell you the origins of
the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, here's the strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our description.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's stuff like AK 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or or Kali missed or since he died since
he star.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of stuff where you're just
like, oh, you still have no idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 years, 25, 30 years on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're still even parentage or where
they got it or who they got it from or
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically just said Heddy's from
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam and Simon from Syria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tony from Sag Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all worked under Neville for a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them ever admitted that they
that they got anything from Neville and
[SPEAKER_00]: used it in their own work ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sounds like they probably should
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think that they you would think
that they did it, but they won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Gunn might now go back and say
certain things, but he's not the most
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but they just it was it was more
like they just decided that secret sauce
[SPEAKER_00]: was best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from then on, the, you know,
the pulling the wool over your eyes about
[SPEAKER_00]: strains became ingrained in cannabis and
being open was rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really it's a really it's kind
of a treat to be able to just talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: all this Neville stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just laid out what it all was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sadly, like with the rename game,
there's a ton of Neville work and a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of our modern shit, but it all goes by
different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trace some of it back and you can
make guesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make some educated guesses,
but that's about all we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, I know there was stuff
that he would look at and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, yeah, that's my X, Y, Z, you know,
like modern strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would say what he thought it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, even for him, it was a guess
at that point, at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and during this,
I should say during this era, I was
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to have kids and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a really active era for Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you were messaging a bunch with
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were actually, you know, so not only
would he answer things publicly on forums
[SPEAKER_00]: that anybody could log in and see,
but he was actually pretty active in
[SPEAKER_00]: communication via email and DM through
those forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: That.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so any number of people had a bunch of
private conversations that revealed more
[SPEAKER_00]: info.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few of us were really we gained what you
would I would assume would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: friendship, but it didn't work out that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a few people were able to ask him
detailed questions and he would respond.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a really shitty connection out in
Australia as far as his modem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the amount that he could pop up and
talk was very minimal and it was always
[SPEAKER_02]: frustrating for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I remember greatly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were also, you know,
like when one of these dudes comes back
[SPEAKER_02]: out of nowhere and everybody wants
something from them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of other people showed up that were
other seed breeders that that wanted a
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they wanted a piece of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had people like Charles Scott
showing up from Reefer Man Reefer Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a big part of what happened
and the falling out of Neville and his
[SPEAKER_02]: disappearance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then we had our good friends
friend Kanga Kanga Tiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably worked with him closer than
any of us out in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked with them hands on and he was
doing a lot of the actual hands on
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding and creation of strange while
Neville wasn't doing as much that but
[SPEAKER_02]: directing more from his area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't know that Neville was doing
some work with his son on a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: things, including a G 13 line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it Kanga that provided us with the
one picture of the haze sea male that we
[SPEAKER_00]: think is legit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the Kanga's pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his pick and it was posted on Mr.
Nice from his tours going over to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland era Mr. Nice, you know,
breeding projects and something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, a lot of those guys,
as Shanti and Neville has said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even though they were partners
with Arjun and they were moving a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and seeds through greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because greenhouse was sort of like
the harbor side, for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sort of like the big dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were still kind of illegally
growing weed and illegally making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as they gave packaging wise,
they could show up to greenhouse and they
[SPEAKER_00]: could sell it through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when Switzerland opened up,
these guys finally saw a way of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy crap, I can do breeding on a
greenhouse level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do things on a much bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be restricted to like
these, you know, these these canal boats
[SPEAKER_00]: that we turn into grows and these
apartments and these houses and these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so a lot of people came out
and visited Shanti and people like Breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve and stuff in Switzerland,
because all of a sudden they had all these
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that they wanted to do and they
started doing a bunch of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making a bunch of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should also probably say that like
the one of the things that I saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least as like a big interest in Mr.
Nice and Shanti Baba at the time with the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank was that at that point,
Neville was famous enough that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted access to his old strains even
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the seed bank was gone and
nobody really trusted Sensi anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sort of viewed what Neville had
given Shanti as the last legitimate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because because Neville gave him a bunch
of clones and tons of old seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sold a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point, we're talking 2009,
2010, everybody, everybody had already
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out that Sensi had outsourced
everything to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody really trusted their work
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their era was sort of dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted that old shit,
everybody sort of felt like that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Neville and then Neville coming
online gave it a ton of legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're asking about his his old
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this and for people that don't know,
like looking back, I saw someone bring up
[SPEAKER_02]: the CBD era.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is before all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is before.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is during the era where Shanti was
fucking militant about fucking femseeds
[SPEAKER_02]: being trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Femseeds are fucking going to ruin
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was no CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was none of this going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was militant anti-fem and the CBD crew
was some of the first fem work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was done by Jaime of Resin Seeds,
not Shanti at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know someone mentioned that earlier,
but that was a little bit later of an era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we talked about on an earlier
podcast that when Matt and Rascal and Hyde
[SPEAKER_00]: and others started doing reversals,
it was not met with a warm, welcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: situation by most of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of breeders and there was
a lot of retail people that thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: cheating and long term harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think I think, you know,
Shanti's CBD work is more like five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: or seven years ago beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mostly Jaime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Jaime from Resin Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally, it was called Resin
Seeds and he released a strain called
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannatonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a fake HP 13 sour diesel hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a few others.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a MK Ultra hybrid that he had
and a lavender, lavender bubble gum that
[SPEAKER_02]: he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't do so well, but the
Cannatonic did kick these crazy CBDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after a few years of Resin Seeds being
around, they started working into just the
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD stuff, which became the CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the reason why we wanted to
do this, this chat or whatever is when
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and I were chatting about like the
beginning of the FEM and reversal era,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the exact same era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that there was like four or five
dudes at most playing around with
[SPEAKER_00]: reversals and the vast majority of the
seed community was still looking at it
[SPEAKER_00]: like some bullshit tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to lead us down the wrong
path.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny how within 10 years that
thing flipped and the regular seeds became
[SPEAKER_00]: the unicorn and the reversals became the
standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we have a fucking rock star in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucking brought skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucking knew everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was the big dust up between ICMAG
and Mr. Nice on the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be like me, bigger,
unfortunately, hempy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of other people on the Mr. Nice side
that were I was admittedly kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: drinking the Neville Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, fuck those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was it did cause a lot of
headaches for Shanti.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shanti was not too stoked when Neville
came back, not only because of the chaos
[SPEAKER_02]: between Sam and the drama that was stirred
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was already some drama going on
between Arianne and Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calling each other fucking water boys and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Neville came back, he also,
like I said, demanded more money from
[SPEAKER_02]: Shanti.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what slowly started the decline
of Neville there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that Shanti necessarily liked
the attention that Neville was getting
[SPEAKER_02]: either because he was getting kind of
overlooked in favor of Neville being there
[SPEAKER_02]: answering questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember in some of the private
communications that Neville isn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: alive anymore to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he'd mind me sharing private
communications.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was one of the big things was
that Shanti didn't want him on the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: He felt this is from Neville's point of
view, not Shanti's.
[SPEAKER_02]: He felt that Shanti was very angry that he
was there and getting all the attention on
[SPEAKER_02]: his site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted to go elsewhere by that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is maybe six months after being
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he had a major interest in the
American genetics, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted to know more about the OG
cushions, the babas, the G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted to see what had happened with
that over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, his interest seemed to mostly
swing over to the American, what we would
[SPEAKER_02]: call Indicas during that time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's an aspect,
too, that I've told Matt this a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the 90s and the early
2000s and stuff and what happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, you know, history repeats itself
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see it over here in America now and
the various beefs and the various camps
[SPEAKER_00]: and the issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which side do you get on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you believe more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also goes to show that in an era of
prohibition and gray area, it's often hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain partnerships over the long
time without one or more parties getting
[SPEAKER_00]: upset at each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it gets rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it right now with, I mean,
I don't need to name the crews,
[SPEAKER_00]: but name most of the super famous lines
that are out right now are families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that stuff getting famous
broke up friendships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and Neville wasn't particularly
friendly with any of his ex partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't particularly friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to some people, it just depended.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really felt like he was friendly to
people that he felt could take him further
[SPEAKER_02]: in what he was interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dutch, I've said this a ton,
too, but the Dutch have a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: approach than Americans to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are much, much, much more money and
business oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you know, Americans have
kind of like a hobbyist weed nerd
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, at least with some people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was a blend of the two and that
Neville did give a shit and Neville did
[SPEAKER_00]: love weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also was Dutch and had a massive
strain of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he wanted money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an early proponent of if you're
using my shit, you should give me credit
[SPEAKER_00]: and money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, he had he had to deal
with Shanti for 250 grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave him all the strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came back X amount of years later and
said, wait, this motherfucker made more
[SPEAKER_02]: than I thought he was going to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: He owes me money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he and this is not from Shanti side.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Neville side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville came to me and said, you know,
what do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the amount of money I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I deserve more money, don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, so by by that point,
you know, from, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple of conversations with
Neville, nothing super deep or as
[SPEAKER_00]: extensive as you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my general sense from what friends of
his told me is that he felt like he broke
[SPEAKER_00]: barriers and went to jail for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ben and Alan drunkers got to got
rich off his company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he left and he and he worked with
Greenhouse and Shanti and Arjun and Arjun
[SPEAKER_00]: got hella rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off his weed and his seeds and his work
and all the cups that Arjun won was when
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti and Neville were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in fact, Neville, Arjun got
banned for a couple of years for trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: bribe a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Neville and Shanti went and remember
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he got he got pinched for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville felt that like he had helped
make other people rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His whole career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shanti was, you know, the latest
person that was doing that to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for I don't think Shanti actually
got nearly as rich as Ben and Alan
[SPEAKER_00]: drunkers from sentencing or definitely not
from Arjun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Arjun's probably worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so he was a little unfair to
single Shanti out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but he but he but he felt like
that had been happening his entire career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so he felt like any any felt
like he undervalued his company to selling
[SPEAKER_00]: it to Sensi because he needed to get out
of jail and he needed lawyers and he
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to get back to Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he and he kind of felt like Shanti
did the same thing in the sense of he was
[SPEAKER_00]: down and hurting and needed money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he took a shitty deal for his seeds
because he couldn't turn it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he should have gotten way,
way more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 250 grand for that area is bank
proceeds like I can't it blows my mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: blows my fucking mind that Shanti was even
able to pull 250K out his ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for everyone listening that this
this happened in the 90s or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably literally like four
hundred and eighty to five hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: forty thousand dollars in today's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of money to him when we say
two hundred fifty thousand dollars is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably actually with today's
inflation, it would be a few mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I looked it up like
twenty, twenty dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you made twenty dollars an hour in
1994, which is when I became an adult,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's thirty nine bucks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably double.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it was half a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is still a shit ton for seeds for
seed, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially old seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that like, you know,
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but I mean, it's also
one of those things where none of us were
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room when any of these deals were
being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to know if Neville was sour
grapes or he got he got worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the way he told it, it sounded like
he was sour grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I and at the time I liked him a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I but even from his point of view,
listening to him, it sounded like you were
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking entitled, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the other part of it, I'll say,
is that when we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: history, sort of the last three big things
that Neville did that made a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money was that 1997 super silver haze,
mango haze, Neville's haze release.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, taste changed and all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like after he sold Shanti those seeds,
Shanti didn't have a period like
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse did or like Sensi did,
where they just like dominated and made
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck tons of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't really have that because because
there's so many many more people were in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so many more Canadians doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a bustling North American
scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hitting everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as that was taking off.
[SPEAKER_02]: The North American scene had just started
booming during that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, Sensi, you know,
when when the drunkers bought it from
[SPEAKER_00]: them, they got 10 years of dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it made Greenhouse the place to
visit in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arjun and his family and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made so much money by winning all
those cups with.
[SPEAKER_00]: By buying all those cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I mean, they, you know,
they they, you know, they had they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: white family and they had fucking all that
hay shit from Neville and Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they won with White Widow and with
Peacemaker and with Super Silver Haze and
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, I mean, I know you're
smiling, but it's just like that probably
[SPEAKER_00]: was some of the better weed over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Barney's farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were taking turns buying the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, and and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, people don't know this,
but there is we could get into some more
[SPEAKER_00]: depth on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like some of the various beefs that
people might have interest in,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, the big issue between
Neville and and Sam, as least as far as I
[SPEAKER_00]: interpret it, is twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, they argued over the exact haze that
Neville got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, you know, Neville thought he was
a shady American that had ties to the
[SPEAKER_00]: government that fucked Neville up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll go over this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to preface this because I
know Mr. Watson has been upset with me
[SPEAKER_02]: even bringing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will preface this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Neville's story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I've researched has shown it
not to be correct as best I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no definitive thing saying
someone's not a snitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way Neville recounted it was that when
Sam went over, I'm not going to say his
[SPEAKER_02]: real name, when Sam went over to
Amsterdam, he went over and he was always
[SPEAKER_02]: there with the DEA handler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, the DEA is not supposed to
function outside of the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the story I was told that he
had a DEA handler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knew who his DEA handler was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Neville's quote was he was called Sam
because of Uncle Sam because he was a
[SPEAKER_02]: government worker.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said they gave him the nickname,
which we also know is probably not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, he said that Sam went over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the first person and only person to
get the Dutch government's approval to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow cannabis, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which he was resented for greatly by
everyone.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was an American getting the
licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Neville basically said the only reason
he got it was because of the DEA handler
[SPEAKER_02]: and the DEA wanted to make money in
Amsterdam and control the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's very, very conspiratorial
and a theory, but there's been no proof to
[SPEAKER_02]: any of that that I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect to it where,
you know, when I first started going over
[SPEAKER_00]: to Amsterdam and really got started
getting the know some of these people,
[SPEAKER_00]: or friends of theirs or whatever,
is that it became quite evident,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like today in today's cannabis world,
that there was camps of friends over there
[SPEAKER_00]: and they all didn't get along and they had
differing stories and beefs over origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville's version of the Hayes story is
that he got a bunch of bulk seed from Sam,
[SPEAKER_00]: including skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he paid a bunch of money for a
bunch of old seed from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he said it was 15 years old at
the time he got it from 70 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of thousands and thousands of
seeds, he got maybe eight or 10 to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from those seeds is all the
breeding that he did and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sam has said that he gave him seeds
that he made while in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he only gave him clones and the
shittier clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had a few different stories of what
he's told Neville that he's written down,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like at various forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said that he gave it because now
because Sam did go over there and make
[SPEAKER_00]: open pollinations and reproductions of
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says that everyone over there got
those reproductions and no one got
[SPEAKER_00]: original seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Wernherd at Posse and Corell at SSC
and Neville all say they got seed from
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: From from Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he had gotten a house before he
gotten set up before anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was selling seeds to make money to get
himself started over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me answer this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: McCormick speaks really favorable of Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that because he knows or because he's
got a hold of some of the skunk in NLC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sam had nothing to do with NLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: McCormick's very favorable because he's
just what he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been friends for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and I mentioned that and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, a lot of the stuff that
that that Todd sells is stuff that Sam has
[SPEAKER_00]: sold through others for a long time that
never got stopped being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like he claims ancient skunk one
and Durbin and this and that and Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Sam has never wanted to
sell directly to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's always wholesaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: To people like SSC or Neville or the
Flying Dutchman or Seedman or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because it's legal to buy a kilo
of or kilos of seed directly in Holland at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was legal to do wholesale seeds within
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he just never got involved with
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Todd sells the same stuff that you
could get from Seedman, that you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Flying Dutchman, that you could
get from any number of different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sourcing is legit, but he tries
to make it seem like they're ancient and
[SPEAKER_00]: rare and they've never before been
released when, as Matt said, they've
[SPEAKER_00]: literally been constantly available
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always blows my mind every time someone
resells skunk one is something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'll say on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, there is skunk one is
obviously a very desirable plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in almost every strain ever that's
still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some skunk one in almost
everything unless it's like an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny part about this,
maybe we should talk about this a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that while Sam is undeniably a mammoth
influence in cannabis and Neville is also
[SPEAKER_00]: undeniably a mammoth influence in
cannabis, they enjoyed immensely
[SPEAKER_00]: denigrating the other person as a chump as
often as they could get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really couldn't take what they
said about each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like really hard because they
disliked each other so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone asked earlier about the
Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did Neville hate it so much?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Neville said that he thought it was
a dull, boring high, no flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's corroboration of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, remember in high times when the
connoisseur went and visited?
[SPEAKER_00]: Raoul, his friend, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's various people that said it was
like a heart pounding shitty body high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't lead to too many good places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that great of a reader.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is because when that popped up,
all you've had was like Colombians and
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had a certain specific high that
they expected from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here comes Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is much different than the Dutch
are used to, any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the Afghani one, it's Mel
Frank's weed, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghani and the Durban that Sam took
to Hollywood, Holland was directly from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will go down to my death saying,
I think Afghani one is the reason skunk is
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky, skunk one or super skunk is
skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the Afghan team was
Afghan one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Neville hit it because he
fucking, and that's why he hated Afghani
[SPEAKER_02]: one so much, because it was in every last
thing it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is based on fucking nothing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even listen to me on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the funny part is that when we talk
about this shit, okay, there's an aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: where you start talking about all the
various people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people start poking holes in that
person's character because it's easy to do
[SPEAKER_00]: because they all have stuff that they are
involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point you're like,
well, which of these shady assholes is
[SPEAKER_00]: telling the truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they all have, you cannot be like,
well, this is the more high character guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's real hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, I can take that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam the skunk man has never fucked me
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so like to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, what I mean by that though is
that like, you know, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same thing I have with that TK
origins do it or whatever about the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once Sam has written three or four
stories of what he gave Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then which version do you believe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they can't all be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an unreliable narrator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got to be lying about some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he wrote it all down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those cannot be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least two of those cannot be true if
there are three states.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them may be true, but there can
only be one that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the other versions have to be
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which version do you go with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we interviewed Correll from SSSC,
he said that Sam gave Neville seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sam was on Cannabis World or ICMAG or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about how not only did he not give
Neville anything good, but they only him
[SPEAKER_00]: and Rob gave him the shitty clones that
they didn't like as much and overcharged
[SPEAKER_00]: him because he was a dick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then he said that he gave him Opie
seeds that he'd already made in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: and he never got any original shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the weird thing that I'll say about
that is that CSI and I and Matt and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all talk about how plants don't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strangely, even though Sam religiously
disses what Neville did and got,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vast majority of the haze cuts that
people hoard and want are from Neville
work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not finding a lot of good stuff in
any of the Positronix haze, Sam haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: direct stuff, or even even even the the
the Correll stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's not a lot of keepers in
America of any of this stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the stuff you talk about,
all the NL5 haze versions, all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all most people's haze that they
know of is some hybrid of Neville's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wondered why Sam never truly
worked haze, being that he was the source
[SPEAKER_02]: for it and he only ever released it in
Opie's and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most baffling thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because and Matt and I chat about this
too, where it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have some friends that firmly believe
Sam everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's and then there's me and
Matt who kind of like completely we
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledge his massive contributions and
we think he's done a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that we think he's
100 percent accurate on the way he throws
[SPEAKER_00]: it all down either.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, it would be the same for me if
I'm telling a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't like someone, I'm probably
going to minimize how much impact they had
[SPEAKER_02]: on things, because from my opinion,
they didn't have much impact on shit
[SPEAKER_02]: because they were liars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the two weirdest things to
me about Sam is that what Matt mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is haze was his favorite line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he spent the next 30 years by his
own admittance, only open pollinating it,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep it as wide as possible and
never doing any directional breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone said, what about Sam's
skunk haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam's skunk haze was so unsellable for
people that it was like the classic
[SPEAKER_00]: freebie.
[SPEAKER_00]: From seed, yeah, from seed boutiques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seed boutiques got kilos or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could never move enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you bought seeds in the earlier mid
2000s, chances you were going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies of skunk haze or skunk tie haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the thunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what they called it,
the thunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not dissing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that, like, it just wasn't
what people were buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was way too much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they gave a bunch of it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, someone asked about connoisseurs
genetics doing in the UK with Neville's
[SPEAKER_02]: old work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that connoisseur he wasn't
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Connoisseur was not around hanging out
with us when Neville came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't in the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where his sourcing comes from
on his Neville stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't really comment on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just say he wasn't a part of our
crew and he wasn't before that either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know where he fits in in the
equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, but basically what
it boils down to, I'll say this about him
[SPEAKER_00]: or anyone else, is that most people when
they start their own haze lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get hybrids from Neville,
like, you know, maybe not directly from
[SPEAKER_00]: him, but some kind of clone only.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they got seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for instance, Soma, his haze work
was based off some G13 by haze A seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville gave him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found a male and that male was the
start of his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville felt like the Collie Mist and a
lot of other sativas in Holland were all
[SPEAKER_00]: based off his haze work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just didn't want to admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to say it was just his.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, all the NL5 haze,
all the PIF, all the SSH, all the mango
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, all the Neville's haze, amnesia,
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all from cuts Neville selected and
crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or and then people took took
that stuff and did what they wanted with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know that I know that connoisseur
or whatever he's he claims he has some old
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that were floating around Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got, you know, Matt was talking
about some of that, some of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: Conga Vito was helping Neville with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, he was doing a bunch of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mullum, baby madness, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was doing some hybrids because Neville
was basically interested in the grail,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grail project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was trying to get trying to get a
fire haze line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he felt the haze genetics were too
narrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did.
[SPEAKER_02]: During that time, I did one that was a
god.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like clockwork orange, the PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we called it and above a female called
the kids grail during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the outback haze comes from that
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bunch of stuff that Neville,
he called it the holy grail project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was basically him trying to figure
out things he could cross old haze cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: and seed to that would maintain that crazy
sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they released a bunch of stuff with
various Neville's hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze was actually not supposed
to be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first step in the holy grail
project.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was them taking an A5 and crossing it
to the seed debt and getting both hazes in
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just so happens they found this
crazy Fino and decided to release seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's pretty much what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was was, you know, so yeah,
I mean, he would have various partners at
[SPEAKER_00]: various times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti was doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti actually has, I think something he
calls grail haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right now on his site,
you know, he's got I haven't looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a couple new haze projects of
things that him and Neville were working
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just decided to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think it's all from that
same same general era when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing various sativas to each other and
seeing what was going to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, I don't think it's
anything more than that, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just super, you know, super
equatorial, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's asking about Ingmar de Shaman's
haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never got to run that,
but I did grow some of Ingmar de Shaman's
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff like the Purple Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I can say is that stuff does not
do well in California Indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the I I have never seen anything
herm so bad and auto flower so reliably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then Ingmar de Shaman's work grown in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not do that over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be acclimated for outdoor
Amsterdam, but over here it did not do
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, a lot of those haze things,
it's like they're they do do phenomenal
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor like those those ones I gave my
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, almost none of us live near
the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not you're not you're going to
have a hard time finishing any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't take the time to acclimate
him at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know what acclimating was
when I grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was no like there was no me
trying to grow it, grow a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also it was auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you couldn't take clones of it anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked, Do you have any hazes
currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I have, you know,
I have a Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple other haze cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the I've got the I've got the dog
shit, which I view as an NL5 haze phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I have I have four or five or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, someone just said creepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's remember I told you a long time ago
on Mr. Nice's site.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was someone that was from Colombia
that sent me seeds of creepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was spelled C-R-I-P-I.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always pronounced it creepy because
I didn't creepy wasn't a word at the time
[SPEAKER_02]: that people were using in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just I thought it meant creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought he was I'll mention this for
a second that someone was just mentioning
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, metal haze metal haze came
out, I believe, in the early to early mid
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s forum era that was by these guys,
Dutch Flowers, and they wrote amazing ad
[SPEAKER_00]: copy for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their descriptions of how they how they
describe their seeds they were offering
[SPEAKER_00]: was certainly an early case of using
advertisement and language to sell seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they got people drooling over the
ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe our buddy Bodie doesn't he
have a metal haze F3 or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he put out one and the rev had his
cut of metal haze me and him did some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a positronics haze 19 skunk one
according to Jojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's the one who supposedly made it
for Richard Calrissian, who sold it as
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the but it you know,
at the time, it was like metal hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they would always claim that it
would sell out within a day or two of
[SPEAKER_00]: being released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of stuff did a lot of stuff,
their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they were really good at the forums
of getting people to be hyped up and that
[SPEAKER_00]: their computer and ready to buy when it
dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were early adopters of that kind of
technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew a bunch of metal haze and metal
haze F2 from seed lines and I grew revs
[SPEAKER_02]: cut and revs cut to me was the supreme
version of any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so much better than any of the a
lot of stuff that I saw from the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: lines was mostly jungly flower that was
not anything viable for today's market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even that great of smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But his metal haze cut the revs was more,
I would say, skunk one dominant in its in
[SPEAKER_02]: his flower time and structure,
but still with a hazy twist to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: not interpenetrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say before I forget,
somebody mentioned that the Dutch Flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: used to claim that it was named metal haze
because of metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went on and on and on about how
growing their haze under metal halides
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out the equatorial aspects of the
sativa because of the type of blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grew it under HPS, it wasn't
going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you're saying bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that's what they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's their copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally what they said.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the original description of positive
tronics haze 19 skunk one was that it had
[SPEAKER_02]: a metallic coppery smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, Dutch Flowers never ever
admitted their sourcing for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, of course not.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's that's like this stuff all
existed as a metallic haze from
[SPEAKER_02]: positronix.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody kind of forgot that that
whole copywriting from that and just moved
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No mercy supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they sold much to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, people were some of the I don't
know, hopefully the person that asked me
[SPEAKER_00]: it was joining someone said is the C5 male
still alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a there's a thing called C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a Northern Lights five by
C male female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cutting is actually in Holland
and it floats around America now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The C male now shanty says he has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's great debate amongst our crew
if he still does or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says he has Afghan T2.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny part about the Afghan T part is
what he says is he lost the skunk part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think because I've seen Shanti do
this before with the the G13 widow that he
[SPEAKER_02]: may be leaving out a part of the genetics
and saying, yes, we have Afghan T,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's probably an Afghan T hybrid like
Ash or one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says that he still has the the C
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that for years he had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville says he gave it to him,
you know, you know, Matt's buddy posted a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of it from the Swiss days in full
flower that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's great debate amongst the crew
what he has and doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with any of the Kiwi seed
stuff, the Mako Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, I mean, I've heard you I've heard
you and Crybaby and friends talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think Demp Kring might have
bought out Kiwi or or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say the Demp Kring is my is my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the coolest coffee shop when
I was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ambiance the way it was built.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have it had really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it had really good weed often,
you know, and so I like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I haven't been there in
a long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least back then they were the bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, people have their A5 and C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are talking about A5 and C5,
which are both NL5 Hayes cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One uses the A dad, one uses the C dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both alive in Europe and America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super political.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very hard to breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to advertise that you have
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that's been a big fucking
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know people would like,
you know, the NL5 crossed A5 and C5 or the
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaiian Lights crossed to it would be
nice if we could do stuff with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, politics are politics and
people are bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the the thing about the Dutch is that
with old cuts and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're not making money off it and
you don't have permission on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really want to give you the
right to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll get a bunch of crap from
them over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is kind of is kind of the way it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they but that's that's an issue,
you know, like we don't know what Shanti
[SPEAKER_00]: still has.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did try to to actually make a
purchase, a big purchase from Shanti.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some some people know about this in our
crew where I was going to buy everything
[SPEAKER_02]: he had with Afghan tea just to see what
what popped out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he wouldn't tell me what he was going
to send me and just wanted me to send him,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, thousand plus dollars on on a
whim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of backed off from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of I wish I would have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, things are getting
tight around COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I have I don't know when I'm
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have probably like 700 seeds from
Shanti that I need to pop at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have that big ass bag of Mr. Nice
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like probably 10 things that I
have, like 70 or 80 seeds of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the collection of stuff and
just do it to it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had a dude, I had all these
plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2017 and 18 and not 19,
but 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there just kept being these crazy
fires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare you get burned down?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we actually are my buddy and
Papa and I like we had a bunch of we had
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a bunch of stuff of Shanti's in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had someone like my like Mendo P by
Maple and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all burned.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's got pictures of it,
but we never we never actually got to try
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so seed popping became like,
you know, am I going to make it through
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That last move I had like two moves ago,
actually, not the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I popped a bunch of shit and then found
out I had to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were selling my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that always happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always fucking happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a long time to figure that to
figure that kind of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have some I have some I have four or
five hazy things from Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have like four or five,
six, you know, skunk Afghan and L type
[SPEAKER_00]: things from him just to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't even know what that's in
reference to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just leave that one alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I ignore the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but that's that's that word itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really only has like one
connotation in American use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fleshy flaccid member.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just flaccid in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when do you use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes me immediately think of Elon Musk
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, because he probably,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I will say that,
yeah, Ortega there's and there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of mystery around that because Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is unfair, but Shanti is a
little bit like cornbread Ricky and that
[SPEAKER_00]: he talks and riddles a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when he explains stuff,
that's this isn't this isn't a diss to
[SPEAKER_00]: either one of them, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying, like, they write
these like three or four paragraphs about
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, you're like, what does
this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crybaby is also very, very verbose and and
mystery writing, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crybaby is good at that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got he's got a good mystery ad copy
at, you know, iambic pentameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, you know, language,
you know, language matters when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to evoke, you know, something or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Shanti is Shanti cryptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti can be very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes Shanti in two or three sentences
can answer something that you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering about for 10 years and then not
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something else that's very simple in
three or four paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I got to add, because I did
say earlier that he was one of the anti
[SPEAKER_02]: femme guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite all of that, in 2008, 2009,
he went out of his way despite hating
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized work, not wanting to do it
himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of the first people to really,
really educate me more about feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: work, how to properly do it and not just,
you know, be throwing shit at a wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me a lot of recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me a lot of advice during that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's integral.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he's very integral into American
feminized lines because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so despite him having negative
opinions on that, he was still kind enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to take the time to educate me and mentor
me on femme stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was really cool of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely say that in our crew of
friends, I'm team Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think he's done a bunch,
you know, to kiss him on the mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know necessarily about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but he but, you know, he he's been in
it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's another one of those guys that like
he kind of took the torch from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's done a bunch of big work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been heavily involved in a lot of
things and he's done something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard, which is he's he's he's sold
seeds for a living for a quarter century.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever grown any of the mandalas
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ashberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some other stuff, a point,
something to be on the brain, something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few good ones that he had
mandala.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, someone just asked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a similar era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, totally underrated, totally
underrated for for the European team.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's still around, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly think, too, like just so
people know, it's not like I'm expecting
[SPEAKER_00]: if you run a bunch of except for the
haystuff, you could find, I'm sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not like I'm expecting with some
other Shanti's lines that like you would
[SPEAKER_00]: find something that would just blow your
head off completely and be as elite as
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best stuff of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that it tie like the
genetics tie back to an era before all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think you could blend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, like straight up,
like imagine you took fucking something
[SPEAKER_00]: like cookie and threw it on, you know,
any number of his things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Nortal or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of a sudden it's like I just
it's just like so much different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not any of the same shit
that you're you know, because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens these days is like it's all the
same 40 or 50 cuts blended together in
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really what it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: La Nina is a really nice string.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like La Nina a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of La Nina seeds and our
buddy, Yo Sammy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talks about how they've crossed La Nina to
various old Neville cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results have been pretty
phenomenal and they get sold in coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a it's a good thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: La Nina is supposed to be a white widow by
Mulan Bibi Madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's like one of the few things
that isn't, you know, sativa direct from
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its origins are mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Neville and Shanti say that it came
from, you know, this region of Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of my friends out in Australia
that have been growing for a super long
[SPEAKER_02]: time outdoors there that are really
familiar with the genetics that floated
[SPEAKER_02]: around there always go back to Indians and
Thais.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think everything is Indians and
Thais.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the bushweed that they have out
there, some combination of Indian and
[SPEAKER_02]: Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like with our American stuff,
we have a lot of Colombian and Mexicans
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was where they were sourced.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what it was close to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was their import.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what they were getting free seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and somebody is somebody and
maybe mean, you know, somebody mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: the mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mango haze from Shanti is still a line
that people find consistently good things
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so it's one of those things
that even today I have I found two mango
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, you know, that I loved a bunch and
kept for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost them in a robbery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sadly, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer mango haze to super silver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone just asked about Wally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually talked to Wally about a month
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're old friends, old friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's grown some of my stuff out in
Australia and out back in 2007,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was talking about coming on the show
and he said he would.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think he just recently did a
different show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to, you know, overwhelm the
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody asked about Yosemite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yosemite would be a phenomenal person to
have on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started growing for Neville's crew in
about 94, 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has a lot of firsthand experience
with a lot of famous cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's a pretty private person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's been I asked him before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it doesn't mean it couldn't
happen, but it hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had it happen yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was he was very active.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the forums when I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he was extremely active back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he posts on IG a bit and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like showing his face and
talking and going through all that mess,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I totally respect people for
having issues with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have Hempi on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would sooner smash my nuts in
a drawer than bring on Hempi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in all honesty, for all the
people watching, the couple hundred or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's here, Hempi would be a
great ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might drive us nuts as far as
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he would probably be like
watching a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at least if he talked,
he wouldn't be typing and spelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was I was a raging idiot even
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Hempi always had me beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the guy be like, bro, can you call
him down a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to hate you if you say
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me saying that to someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, he's crybaby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I don't know where it
would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the entertainment value of having
Hempi on Tom Hill, you know, we we Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill communicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Hill communicates with our crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would also be a great ad.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the old timers are are are very,
very they're they're characters,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're characters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have an interview already
recorded with what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do we really want to say his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, OK, well, I won't say his name,
but it was a person who was one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: original owners of one of the earliest
Hydra shops in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was highly recommended by Greg Greg
because he knows a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was integral to the Northern Lights
crew and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we haven't released it because some of
these dudes, like they didn't really want
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've more than they wanted to talk about
fucking hookers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll say this, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy talked at such a rate that I think
I got two sentences in in an hour and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made not so quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can believe I couldn't talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt and I were texting each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was we did get I think one or two
very interesting tidbits like half a
[SPEAKER_02]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was literally like it's no
exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of weed talk and an hour and a half of the
craziest hookers and and and stories from
[SPEAKER_00]: then and cops Trump and conspiracy
theories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was I mean, it was we may release
it one day just because he was very
[SPEAKER_02]: excited for us to release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he was I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chose to sort of protect him by not
releasing it because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was it was just the thing where it was
like we were sort of interested in weed
[SPEAKER_00]: history and he was sort of interested in
telling us all the wild tales of his
[SPEAKER_00]: youth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I think he had a different
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he thought maybe we were interviewing
about his life as opposed to weed and the
[SPEAKER_00]: his relation to weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but it was also kind of like even
when you would try to steer him in the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction of talking more about weed,
he would just mention it as a side and
[SPEAKER_00]: then get right back to something super
kooky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the dude was hella cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we will, you know, like,
I mean, I think now that we're past the
[SPEAKER_02]: Trump era and a lot of that everybody's
mad stuff, I think maybe we could release
[SPEAKER_02]: it now and it wouldn't be as or maybe it
would be a worse time to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it it it goes to show we will have
a poll.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be very important in music or weed
or art or this or that or whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outside of that, you can be a human
with a wide variety of views, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of us have some illnesses,
you know, one kind or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's something there's something
odd about weed people, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but I mean, it was like it's it
there's parts of it that are pretty risque
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I say some fucked up shit
and I say some off the wall homoerotic
[SPEAKER_02]: things even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't know if we can put
that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was it was definitely our race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want him to get canceled over
or anything fucking crazy, because that
[SPEAKER_02]: can happen, you know, like if people think
that he said something too extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the dupe is an important part of
that Pacific Northwest history.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he even was a part of Operation
Green Merchant and he was definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in tons of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting him to talk about any specifics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he just he I mean, he was
basically like we were the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was his we were not really
interviewing him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like we were there for his his
monologue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get a few like of my my really weird
where I try to keep a straight face and
[SPEAKER_02]: say something totally off the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like two of those in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got two of those in the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said Eddie Lep was a wild
interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie Lep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've talked about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a pretty he was a decent friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was a he had huge balls and
he was also a massive egomaniac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have we have pluses and
minuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Neville was kind of complicated.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Neville was a you know,
I mean, you know, Neville had addictions
[SPEAKER_00]: and Neville had issues and, you know,
and all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also had huge balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be hard for us to find like to get a
crowd of a bunch of seed makers together
[SPEAKER_02]: and find more than 10 people that aren't
ex junkies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of the 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're one of the very few.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the few.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was you can you can thank DeadTor
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I got I got to see what even like
successful junkies looked like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being a functional junkie is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the sense, what I mean by
functional is like the dude that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling with, he just made so much
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he never had to do any of the like
the shit that people like he made plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could easily afford his habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just got to see it from the
perspective of like, what does it do to
you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't really have to hustle or lie or
cheat or this or that or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't his thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, painful, painful feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount and the crazy part about it
is that to go from like flopping like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fish and sweating and vomiting and pooping
and, you know, fever and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody shows up and takes care
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some tacos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes later, he pops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'm going to wash my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just spent two hours in the hotel,
like in, you know, unbelievable misery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's it's also true that a lot
of that addiction and stuff was super
[SPEAKER_00]: common up in Mendo and Humboldt and all
that because it's dark and rainy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially back in the day,
people got lonely, you know, and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of money because, you know,
we'd sold for a lot back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of people that would
started out as back to the Landers and
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up, you know, addicted to opiates or
cocaine or this or that or whatever else,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were bored in winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even when I was I started my
career as a fuck up, like everybody during
[SPEAKER_02]: that time wasn't just selling weed,
at least out of our group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was just selling weed like as it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were going to get the same charges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't really fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't fucking matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were selling weed, you might as
well be selling everything because other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff made more money than weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was it was just it was around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was common during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, what's interesting about that
is not not to dis Neville on or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's weird is that Neville being a
hardcore junkie is actually what brought
[SPEAKER_00]: him to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had the seed and he was part
Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had part of, you know,
they had very liberal policies over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got extremely clean dope from
from Asia traditionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he went there to be a junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of fell into the seed game,
you know, while there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's kind of like without without
heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the things that we talk about
don't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it was Clyde Clyde that told
me that Neville got he was the Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: government had a program for people to get
off heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would help them with a trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Neville was breeding exotic bird seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they gave him money to start the bank
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was he got grants to get off dope and
claim that he was breeding more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritious, you know, omega three,
whatever the fuck, you know, protein rich
[SPEAKER_04]: rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took that money and he used it to
start the seed bank, which is super punk
[SPEAKER_00]: rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let the government pay for your
fucking dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have it to be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the a lot of the pictures in
those old seed catalogs and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that are from his photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mentioned it, his photographer Clyde,
who's still, I believe, still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, he, you know,
he went with Neville on Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Afghanistan trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghanistan trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the pictures like in
Neville's first catalog of him holding
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and him hanging out and smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: With with, you know, the Afghans and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all his his photographer Clyde.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's talked about doing an interview
with us, but he also has some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: movie deal thing with that specific story
of the Afghanistan trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he can't legally tell it for some
reason, like on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting in the sense that,
you know, maybe I should tell this because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sam Skunkman and Neville both went to
Afghanistan at different times and they
[SPEAKER_00]: both have some pretty crazy stories about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sam has this funny story about trying
to get seeds from some of these muhajideen
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of these fighters and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this warlord that looked at
him and basically told him that flour is
[SPEAKER_00]: for slaves and women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And real men smoked hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so was he a slave or a woman?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sam got and Sam got out of it by
telling him he had no interest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, that he agreed it was for slaves
and women.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wanted the seeds to be able to grow
to make his own hashish in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Afghan warlord decided that was
fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made him smoke a bunch of hash with him to
prove that he wasn't a bitch, essentially.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and then, you know, Neville Neville
has a story and Clyde is back it up of
[SPEAKER_00]: going over there and having to negotiate
with literal muhajideen warlords.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they had a bunch of
American money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And were they going to get killed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to get robbed?
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds the story coming from from Clyde
and Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one of the best stories ever,
especially the one that wasn't published.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one that's out there that he's
that is part of the movie script that
[SPEAKER_02]: people have seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he told me the stuff that wasn't in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like a fucking nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was overdosed, dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside of this little tiny hut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had people trying to get they were
trying to get in to kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they wanted to kill them because they
thought they were Americans with money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they wanted to fucking kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a funny story about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that in a weird way, when we just
talked about how without heroin,
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville never would have been to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Neville went over there to get seeds,
the Afghanistan people were very worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about CIA and D and these kind of groups
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they wanted to make sure that he
wasn't a European spy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to prove that him and
Clyde had to shoot heroin because they
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were like, if you're not,
you know, you're going to if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds, if you want this work,
if you don't want us to kill you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to prove that you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that an agent would never.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is they both they both had to shoot
heroin in order in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they were both they both
partied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Clyde OD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clyde decided to die, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then he OD in a fucking hut and
some, you know, ancient village or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and had, you know, and it was it
was it wasn't like there was some like
[SPEAKER_00]: modern hospital nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he OD on Afghanistan on Afghan heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, OK, well, these guys
shoot up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made them shoot up in front of them
and actually use needles in the whole bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's how he got the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tried to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they they tried to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I couldn't have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't have any I would OD for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have zero zero tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I probably would have just
been right there with Neville story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Sam didn't have to do drugs,
but Sam basically like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way he tells the story or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, an Afghan warlord was
considering turning him into his bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's got to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like maybe, you know,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those there's definitely some Indiana
Jones aspects to those like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: going into war zones after seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have Bodhi come on and tell
some of his Indian trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually the in season one we wanted
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted we wanted to do a hippie hashish
trail thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to put more time and effort
into building it out because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a long story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bodhi agreed to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of gotten backburnered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would probably be a great episode
because Bodhi has the experience of
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt and I have a bunch and some
friends have a bunch of documents and
[SPEAKER_00]: posters and different things from that
era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could always get Joe Petrie if we
wanted to get the king of Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get the king of Nepal on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would probably be as off the rails as
Hempi or he did a show with with Blue Lies
[SPEAKER_00]: the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely duo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was there was, you know,
a lot of the early Afghans and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because all the sativas that people
have in America basically came with free
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds with the kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hashish didn't come with free
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sam and a bunch of these people had to
travel the hippie hashish trail and go
[SPEAKER_00]: find it and bring it back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Mel Frank says that the grower
that he got the Afghani one seeds from in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bay had done that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, supposedly the big butt is from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, supposedly the Steve Murphy that
started the NL one or the NL lines is all
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all from different people going over to
Amsterdam, going over to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a it was a female that went and it
was and the Murphy Afghani is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't know if it was Afghanistan or
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was a girl that brought it
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Young lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can answer that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what do I think of the what do I
think of the the burner and the Bodhi
[SPEAKER_00]: collab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi is a good friend and he's done a
bunch of very cool work and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people trying to figure out how to
survive in this weird new world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cookies and burner and all those
people aren't breeders and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely looking to keep they don't know
where to go and they need help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to bring in outside help
because they've had kind of their new new
[SPEAKER_00]: is sort of the same same that they've had
forever now and they don't know where to
[SPEAKER_00]: go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of irrelevant for cookie to
have new shit because it's like now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a store and a clothing brand and
they're just they're just established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all they had was that one cookie
explosion in 09 to 12 that produced the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: KB and the animal and the this and that
led to all this other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but burners a salesman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're going to need to partner
with real weed people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bodhi's not a scumbag.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's a very nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I'm stoked about it because I think
it's it's the way to influence the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it were, that that listen to people
like cookies, you can finally push them
[SPEAKER_02]: into like better weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bodhi knows good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a good person.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that said, if they fucking if he gets
fucked in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I mean, look, what Matt is
basically saying is that there's a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to stand out side and throw Molotov
cocktails at every rich established group
[SPEAKER_00]: that's trying to take over weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can try to work with them or work
within their structure and move them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's arguments to be made on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every group is monolithic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whether we like it or not,
you know, rich, rich investor kids are
[SPEAKER_00]: taking over weed in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if you if you're not willing
to work with rich investors, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a chance in hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up, you know,
on Friday nights telling fucking stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: history stories is what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you know, this is fine
because this is actually a hobby for me
[SPEAKER_00]: and I enjoy bullshitting here if I make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'll say this, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talked about it before when I
was doing the Superdog project 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, there was no market for American seed
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was almost no way to get a hold of
people to sell seeds to them if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just too risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram in the last 10 years has created
an environment where all these
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfuckers can start breeding and
selling direct to the public and buying
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and selling those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was there's been an explosion of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that breeding was based on a bunch
of small and medium sized farmers and
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of indoors and thousands of
small outdoors growing weed and pushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the traditional and the dispensary
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's all been cut off now and it's
all a bunch of corporations pushing weed
[SPEAKER_00]: to the dispensary market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traditional market is trashed and
there's not very much money in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to sell a bunch of beans
and have feno hunting and do a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff, growers need to be making
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be having disposable income
to go to these things and buy a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and look through it and have a bunch
of it not work out and have one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: things they find they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so the dynamics of seed
making has changed dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually Matt and I chat about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually more worried about diversity
than I was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, legalization has been so far bad
for diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the way that they've set
things up, you would think that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: really open it up, but you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it very narrow how to make
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and what to try and where to get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have to get stuff from
nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the nursery doesn't want to make
a commercial amount of clones of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't even buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made a lot of rules and a lot of
regulations that, you know, it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: easy like in the 215 era, motherfuckers
could go to Emerald Cup or High Times or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and go see Matt and go see Bodie
and go see Swamp Boys or go see whoever
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy packs of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my next.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my next 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my next 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These from seed outdoor next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they needed to do to do that was
money in their pocket and the desire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now what do you do with all
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that shit's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now shit's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard, you know, and on all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of that diversity is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look at the 215 era when we
first got on IG really and how many
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds and hundreds of small medical
gardens would you see people posting shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that were growing 25 or 50 or 99 plants?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons.
Tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, none of you get to talk
shit about Bodie or I'll fucking deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: all you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, seed makers like Matt or
like Bodie or like see any any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got to figure out what they're
going to do to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the market has changed and the
buyers have changed and the pressures have
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you fit in?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope he changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope he changes things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I hope that he's one of the
avenues that opens a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: smokers minds that shit more than cookies
and OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone has to break that mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope there's there's an aspect to it
where it's like, you know, the the the bad
[SPEAKER_00]: part about it for anybody that's going to
bitch would be Bodie decided to save his
[SPEAKER_00]: family by joining the Borg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good part of it would be Berner can
promote the shit out of crappy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens if Bodie makes them
improve their thing and he's promoting the
[SPEAKER_00]: crap out of much better weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people end up smoking much better
weed and then make money off much better
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a connoisseur market that
doesn't exist right now currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, because, you know,
it's like I so, you know, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect to it where it's like people can
throw stones from outside, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that easy of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does the seed breeder go?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't even back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many how many gray area cups?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not gray area coffee shop,
but how many cups?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many events would you go to a year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be you could be a seed breeder
and you could be at one or two events a
[SPEAKER_00]: month selling seeds to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, during some years you could during
some years, you know, and there would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: top dog booth and there would be a riot
booth and there would be a CSI booth and
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be I remember the first year
that Bodie was at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't even get to talk to him till
Sunday because I felt bad because there
[SPEAKER_00]: was literally like a 80 yard line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In front of his booth Friday and Saturday
all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a madhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was thousands of people with money
in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to buy seeds from Bodie
and talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can't do that because he's not
licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sold through whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have a dispensary license.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have a he doesn't have all the
fucking pieces of paper that allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: just walk up and talk to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you with the rules have cut off a
lot of these independent types from even
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing, you know, and talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it would be funny like
when we would go to Emerald Cup and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason why we started doing
these candle candle Luminati parties is
[SPEAKER_00]: because none of the none of the friends
got to talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all busy working their booth all
day long because the customer wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to them to make the purchase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to be a rude fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started throwing these like
nighttime events, you know, every night,
[SPEAKER_00]: every night that it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wanted to see who the best kisser
was, but he wanted to see his friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to see my friends, you know,
and so, you know, we ran into beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: houses and we cooked out and, you know,
we had bitter on the grill and we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of really good friends and tons of
people would come, you know, tons of tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of breeders, tons of movers and shakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after they were done talking all day
to customers, they wanted to hang out with
[SPEAKER_00]: people like them and shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because before it's like, you know,
it's like, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's like, you know,
it's like, you know, you're going to go up
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to try to talk to Bodie
or CSI or something on, on Friday at three
[SPEAKER_00]: o 'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's six people deep and 50 yards long
waiting to talk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are stressful times too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're talking to a new person
every five minutes, it's hard to remember
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those companies made bank off
renting booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of people output
thousands of dollars and hired friends to
[SPEAKER_00]: help them run the booth and move things
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a cost to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to let people work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to let people hand, you know,
shake hands and shoot the shit and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: and talk about their strains and,
you know, sell as much of their stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: the public as they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, now this year,
I think at Emerald Cup, they finally did
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing where there was like a little
like legacy grower section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard, you know, where, you know,
you could, you could go see people where
[SPEAKER_00]: they could have weed, where it wasn't like
it didn't have to be through a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through a distro because essentially the
215 era cups were like swap meets.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know how good we had it with
250.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: People could go and sell seed and they
could sell weed and they could sell dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: and they could sell this and they could
sell t-shirts and they could just rent a
[SPEAKER_00]: booth, you know, have some basic licensing
and show up and, you know, meet people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, you know, it,
it, you know, now it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone mentioned that the other day that
someone talked about the party on a
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we, Matt and I made
a big mistake on and COVID fucked us on
[SPEAKER_00]: the parties, but we're going to,
we're going to try to bring them back is
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wish we had given out like a hi,
my name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of these people,
they don't know each other by sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know each other by their handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we don't know each other by first name.
[SPEAKER_02]: By first names or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're walking around and you're like,
Oh, that person was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause there's hundreds of people
there and not that you don't talk to your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends all night, but it's like,
there's people you miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you'd walk by him and be like,
Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so-and-so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, next time I'm going to have the
dank dabber there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You watch, you watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys don't know, dank dabber is
where it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: He makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like essentially what we tried to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is like when, when cannabis got super
legal, we tried to have like an old school
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest festival party where the tables
were just covered in weed and jars of all
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people could just roll joints and take
bong hits and shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you have, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it, it eventually the
last year or so we did, I don't even think
[SPEAKER_00]: we went to the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just waited for all the people we
wanted to see to come and party and hang
[SPEAKER_02]: out that first year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went, I went to the cup and I remember I
got sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, there are too many fucking
people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, but that was what was real about
a lot of those old events was it was
[SPEAKER_00]: organized chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the more rules that they put into
place was 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of cut off the customers from
being able to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially like Emerald cup in
December, there would be so many people
[SPEAKER_00]: that would show up with money in their
pocket from their outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready to buy seeds to Fino hunt for the
next outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of dollars were spent on just
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of money, you know, was, was,
was spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one year it was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's now the whole market,
but now not only the seed, the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: maker's ability to get in front of people,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to build their brand or whatever,
you know, or like the, the seed maker's
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to sell or even the people that
would normally buy their seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: how little they're getting for weed right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really puts a lot of pressure on seed
makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different time, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have, they're going to have
to adapt how they're doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we'll see who sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I think I got to start
getting ready to wind it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in an hour and 45 minutes
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Matt do his pitches pitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might have.
