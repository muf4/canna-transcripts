[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to do a quick video about the
Cosmic Boogie poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there is a website out there that
goes over each individual little thing on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but a lot of people have not been able
to find really good, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: images about it, or of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible to find an original.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an original, but I wanted to go
over it with you for all you Haze Fanatics
[SPEAKER_00]: and Strain Whores out there, so you can
see what makes this poster so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we have the signs of the Zodiac,
if you look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scorpio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only one I know, because I mean
Leo, the fucking Earl, whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some scales and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they have the constellations up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite sure what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's just a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a tall bud, I forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how Haze looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It references the silver and the blue
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It references magenta and gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the four original types of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connoisseur's Choice Cultivated California
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what it says right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can get it to focus for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't quite get it to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nature We Trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Americana, 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: No seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, back then, people would
fucking fuck with the weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warning, in some states, cannabis is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cosmic Boogie, 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Cosmic Boogie, this is where it
gets its name from, the poster.
[SPEAKER_00]: In clandestine locations sparsely
scattered throughout California,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few dedicated farmers cultivate the herb
cannabis as a way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can grow weeds and see the virgin
greens, but to cultivate the exotic queens
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond your dreams, you should have
dedication, sensitivity to plant life,
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency, and a little basic knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good karma and a great desire to find
harmony with mama nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basis for any strong, healthy plant is
the soil it grows in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin producing herbs grow best in soil
that is neutral to semi-sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger the bush or tree, whatever it may
be, the larger the root structure needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots develop mostly freely in a loose,
rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix one yard of soil compound of 30%
mushroom compost, 30% redwood sawdust,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% sandy loam topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix organic nutrients, three pounds of,
what does that say?
Boof?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three pounds of hoof and horn meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three pounds of hoof and horn meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five pounds of rock phosphate,
four pounds of kelp, one pound natural
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, one pound soil, iron,
five pounds gypsum, and five pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: dolomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supposed to be the recipe they use
to grow the hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix soil and minerals thoroughly and let
sit for at least one week, then check the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil with a soil testing kit for pH and
add agricultural lime to bring pH to 7.5
[SPEAKER_00]: to 8.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring arrives and with it comes new life,
fresh spirit, and a great hope for the new
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant your favorite seeds on the sixth or
seventh of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon is in Cancer, best sign for
planting above ground herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In May, the third, fourth, and fifth are
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're still not together, try June 8th
and 9th while the moon is in Scorpio.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you irrigate, make sure that the moon
is in one of these signs when possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer is the most excellent time to
irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taurus, Scorpio, and Pisces are also good
for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning should be done only in the third
quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience is the real secret and the true
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to make it until December 10th or 11th
when the moon is in Leo and harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions are perfect so you can dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nature We Trust, the spirit of 76,
and it says right here, copyright,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1975, Robert Lund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is signed by Granddaddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He raffled this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a Seattle Hempfest or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where this got loosened from his
grips and ended up with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of love everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
