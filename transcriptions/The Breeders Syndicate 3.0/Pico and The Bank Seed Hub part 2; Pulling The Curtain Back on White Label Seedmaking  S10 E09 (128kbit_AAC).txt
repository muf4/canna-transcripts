[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_04]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_04]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_04]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_04]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to start on part two of
Pico.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to just have it crash into
the interview, so had to throw something
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you haven't seen part one,
go back and watch part one from last week.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's available in our uploads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last video last week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So without further ado, we're going to go
ahead and jump in and resume where our
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep going on some of the current
work, if that's OK, because I got
[SPEAKER_01]: something to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Nycap Exotica season two,
we just did a run in the Arizona facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the first actual seed pop
runs that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We selected a really beautiful plant from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super excited for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have her in new pollinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones that are notable that I
done recently is the Blue Tint,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the Blue Dream to Lemon Cushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just more blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less haze, less musk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of it in there,
but it really goes back to the true
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Lemon Cushman, just kind of
compacted things a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: made it tighter, and gives a little more
bling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a nice color element to it as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones I like the best, I'm finding
the blueberry up front and then a really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice lemon on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like trick cereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever get the lemon on trick cereal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find that in Irene and all kinds
of stuff like that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've experienced it before, and I love
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're growing, there's a little
bubble gum in it, but it kind of goes away
[SPEAKER_01]: after the cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really, really, really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed smoking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Onion Baji, which is the Chem
4 Sunshine Daydream, Cross the Lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: Cushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the nastiest thing that I have
smelled in so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheesier than cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a cut in Oregon called the
Silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys ever had that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it Super Silver also,
or no, they call it Silver Surfer also.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds familiar, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: That really does, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a little sample Green Bodhi
shared a little sample with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember in the 90s in Cleveland getting
this bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it smelled like sewage fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like puke and fruitiness at the end
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember having it under the car,
under my seat of my car, not taking it in
[SPEAKER_01]: my house, coming back into my car later,
and the whole car fucking stunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the most righteous shit ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw it before or after I got it
one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I Green Bodhi gifted me some
of the flower from the Silver Surfer,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the other dudes on the Discord
knows about the Silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been asking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been able to get a cut of it,
but the Onion Baji really mimics it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is like white cheddar popcorn,
onions, body odor, and there's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: touch of bubblegum when it's growing,
like a Northern Lighty kind of bubblegum
[SPEAKER_01]: in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the stinkiest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tests really high, which I don't
generally care about, but I do have a job
[SPEAKER_01]: to do, and that's part of the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does test really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bell ringer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very heady.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smokes like a haze, like a really
strong haze, but it's just fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the one I'm reversing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to hit all my new cuts with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit a lot of the current
stuff I have in the stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of just old OGs and chem and
Kush varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of new stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will blend really well with
both the kind of heady hazes and the OGs
[SPEAKER_01]: and the danker stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that flavor profile, I think,
is going to really lend itself to some
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just finished the reversal of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm shedding pollen now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably, I don't know, seven weeks
from seed maturation, and then we'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: all the phenol hunts on site out there in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be a cool one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, God, where else am I smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use the Night Pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: which I had mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cross that into the purple Caz as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a run of about 50 in the
facility, and we found one that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: completely unlike all the others,
extremely dense and super tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the KPIs for THC and
cannabinoid content is the density,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I just found that out from Mark
Lewis recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can sort of look at density and
have a correlation, at least with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this this rang true for this one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other plant that I tested from this
cross was like, you know, lower mid 20s,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like a 22, 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing hit 29.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smokes like a haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the effect again is different,
but the flavors there, it's very attic-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mango is stripped away entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like old books and leaves the incense
straight in the air when it burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one I call the taser.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of an homage to my buddy
who is the family that gave me the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: cast in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of an homage to him and a little
thank you back, but super excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: that one as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did do some land race work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some purple trankski from a dude
that used to be in the group.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember when he was passing those
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Farah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gave me some purple trankski.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did pretty decent size hunt with that
actually in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find anything cool in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that and then I was running some
blue Panama that was gifted to me from
[SPEAKER_01]: some friends who I was working with at the
time that just got rid of all their males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found some really nice, very,
very haze-like stuff in the blue Panama
[SPEAKER_01]: that I really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I crossed that with the,
I called it, the selection I made for the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple trankski was what I call purple
South African or PSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, it's like grape syrup,
super black.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant stays green, the bud goes
really, really dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used that in just a one-off cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did the land race check,
I was looking for THCV stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just did like a solo cup run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in January, I put all these plants that
were like this high in solo cups outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: let them all go to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all finished like this high with one
mega bud on the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did selections from there,
just reveged right out of the solo cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to do like basically 500 plants
in like, I don't know, an eight by eight
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to water many times a day with a
hand can.
[SPEAKER_01]: My son was young at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was helping me out just watering them
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally like need to be watered
constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a cool thing I learned from that is if
you do that and you do a pollination in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early spring, you can actually let
everything revege.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds will finish and then you can
take cuts off the plant again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just an unrealized technique,
but it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was an easy way to hit
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow really small plants contained to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I could pollinate everything and
then still get the cut off the clone of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best one at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a good learning experience
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recently in the facility, I crossed the
Blue Panama into the Purple South African
[SPEAKER_01]: and have run the seeds from that and found
some really interesting stuff actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super sensitive though to the high
PPFD and high EC that we run in the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, just being like an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to need some taming,
but it is like magenta.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole bud turns super dark and it
smelled like foot cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like toe jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was disgusting, but it was like
disgusting in the best possible way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the onion Baji is going to hit that
land race genetic also, which should just
[SPEAKER_01]: be a fucking disgusting stink fest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the land race work is honestly the
interesting thing I think is my ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where that hermaphrodites are sort of like
a modern cannabis problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your sex issues are due to bad breeding
practices and people using bag seed and
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the land race stuff that I've run,
I found more herms and land race
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently than I have in just general
modern cannabis strains, which I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: was really interesting because it just
kind of took that idea and smashed it for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little finicky and definitely
lower cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to find something from the land
race that's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did run the black African magic
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did you find something that someone
labeled that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Cora genetics has some Cora.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can send you a link.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bunch of pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely land racy, tighter in some of
them, some dark colors, kind of a cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: luden smell on the best of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of them were very hay-like and
not much to speak about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The labs in Arizona aren't quite
sophisticated enough to really pick up on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were looking for THCV in those
and didn't pick any up, but that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: mean that it didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the labs are actually
capable of testing for it out here quite
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did run those recently as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, honestly, I'm just going
back to my regular work because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more value.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know the history behind the African
black magic, the mythology and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I've read about it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, when those are passed to
me, super skeptical and not going to call
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's not even that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Realistically, the first time I ever saw
it referenced was DJ Short's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he described it as some weed he was
brought.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like crumbled pieces of shit,
like brown, but had thick, thick hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heavy, dark smoke and fucked him up like
nothing ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think with modern eyes reading that,
like knowledge, you would realize that's
[SPEAKER_05]: just African cob, like Malawi cob,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think really it's the African black
magic really is a process of how it's
[SPEAKER_05]: dried and cured as opposed to straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know what the origin of
these are outside of what he told me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Africans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I still I'll send you some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have some.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like the Malawi a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the South African stuff that
I grew from Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy the smoke of all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I find that if I'm smoking a lot
of land race stuff, I'll end up finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: and capping off with something modern to
sort of get that effect back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also in modern times and newer
growers, the idea of land races sounds
[SPEAKER_05]: really exotic and unique and cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: See something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That isn't in the modern cannabis world,
but like in theory or that's in theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in practice, like it takes big pops.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it's going to smell like,
hey, not be applicable to indoor grows,
[SPEAKER_05]: not finishing any time that they're
comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much that goes to it,
but it's great seeing people take hold of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know what they're getting into and
really giving these things a shot,
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing what's in there and be willing to
to go through the hard work and big pops
[SPEAKER_05]: to find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I admire that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's it's it's restrictive
for big pops because of those African form
[SPEAKER_01]: or aforementioned reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can get away with big pops with
the more modern stuff that's going to test
[SPEAKER_01]: well, because I can always homogenize into
some pre rolls or make some extract or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, where the land race stuff,
I'm probably not going to get more than
[SPEAKER_01]: one pass on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the selection I made from
these, I'm going to grow out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just took a clone run of it today,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to continue down that line
and see what's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's going to be a high test
or anything, but it is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth of exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it is exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smell of it is not like anything
that you smell in modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be interesting to see if I can
make it work at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think you can with enough time,
enough dedication.
[SPEAKER_05]: You absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of it's got to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's future breeding work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like something I want to add in to
get something novel out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the purpose of a plant is just a
building block.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for you, yeah, very much a means more
than an end in itself, at least at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's part of the enjoyment that
keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the learning experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the exploration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the discovery of what's
interesting about being in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll keep growing them and keep trying
to source them, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude also gave me some Chinese seeds
that are they're as big as my babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the biggest seeds I've ever seen
in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's got he's got an extensive land
race collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a lot of work in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think he had a lot of connections
through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did a lot of work in Africa,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got some interesting connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a really interesting guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's definitely an OG and and knows his
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out, Kora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics, I definitely recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some cool shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they were even the ones that were
doing like Viking and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: like redoing, bringing back some really
obscure, rare shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his whole his whole thing is
obscure and rare, which I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that is that bald man Lala running it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, his name is Hardy.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I'm not familiar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew there was like Lala in the
collective and monkey and few others that
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not familiar with who who's in his
circle or isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've crossed them a couple of times and we
were kind of in similar circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was generous enough to give me with
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And likewise, I'll do the same back to him
till the end of time, because I appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: that about the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, thanks so much for telling us
about those those projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there any more recent work you wanted
to highlight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise I wanted to get into
like maybe a broader discussion on the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and your thoughts on certain
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else have I been doing that's
interesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's I'm running a line now called
Red Bananas, which is an offshoot and has
[SPEAKER_01]: some more modern stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keeping true with the banana line,
like the red bananas a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great extract plant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't always pop a new season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the thing is that like as
much as I complain about the fickle nature
[SPEAKER_01]: of the of the like the retail consumer
that we're always selling to, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as soon as one project's done,
it's kind of on to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really excited now to be to be
pollinating again, because I've had a
[SPEAKER_01]: hiatus on that for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really the focus will be on
really collecting some better hard data on
[SPEAKER_01]: reversal specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am offering a DIY reversal kit
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something really simple just to let
people make it at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want to do to be able to
support that a little bit more is
[SPEAKER_01]: specific, like M.L.
[SPEAKER_01]: dosages, you know, for how much you're
going to need to get a successful reversal
[SPEAKER_01]: and what types of plants do better with
this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the minimum?
[SPEAKER_01]: So helpful apply, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you should talk to me, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's getting into the spray market
and I'm trying to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not really getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I've done is a lot of times
when people when people support,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've I've offered it as a freebie like
I'll give you a freebie because I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: shitload of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like in the same way that as
a director of cultivation, I have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: very open and and supportive of home
growers, you know, which for sure most
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are in that who are in that
position, they want to sell them all their
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not really what it's really
about for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the same way that I want to support
home growers, I want to support other
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have any secrets that I
don't also share any tech I share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the same thing with if you need
access to those types of chemicals to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do a reversal or information on
how to do it, I'm pretty much an open
[SPEAKER_01]: book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a it's not really a business
venture by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something else that I have
sharing to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like one of those gate kept type
things for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember even back on overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hard to get people's like data,
what they were actually putting in their
[SPEAKER_05]: spray to reverse like people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And nowadays you could find the info
really easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just a little bit of like,
especially for me, because I wasn't a
[SPEAKER_05]: chemist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I did horrible in chemistry in high
school.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just about doing it, trying it,
not being scared to fail, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the biggest thing to
overcome with reversals, not being scared
[SPEAKER_05]: to fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be failure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I learned a lot from from doing so
many so many at a time time when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: pumping out the seeds, it was like I would
have a general population area that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would do the STS sprays and also the seed
maturation that was just always on a 12 12
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would have four additional
chambers off to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as that group of plants that
was going to be a donor was ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse, they'd go in the tent and the
plants that were going to be met by them
[SPEAKER_01]: would be in the tent with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd go through their pollination phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'd pull I'd call the males or call
the reverse and pull everything else into
[SPEAKER_01]: the general population area and just let
everything mature there and then refill
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent and keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had four of those at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just going perpetual seed making,
seed making, seed making.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learned a lot about in a quick amount
of time about how much to apply,
[SPEAKER_01]: when to apply, how far in advance to your
flower date can you start to apply to get
[SPEAKER_01]: those numbers up in the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some interesting different techniques
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and again, I just to reiterate,
too, I learned more about breeding from
[SPEAKER_01]: from auto flowers than anything else by
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really because there's like
there's a well, one, there's a can't miss
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: The selection is easy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you just keep it on 16 hours
and it and it flowers, you have an auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't, you don't have the trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So selections on that end are really easy
because you can just do a wide swathing
[SPEAKER_01]: spray and anything that doesn't reverse
isn't going to go into flower and will
[SPEAKER_01]: never create pollen to hit anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like that's a lot of learnings in
auto flowers and even more so on recessive
[SPEAKER_01]: traits and the heritability of those
absolutely is really important today.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everyone who's seeking the roadkill
skunk, if you cannot find it in an F1,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to go down your line
and you're going to have to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking work and put in some effort if you
want to try to find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone selling F1 seeds as like a
roadkill skunk, I think like that's if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's recessive and it's looking like it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, enough about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, a lot of times people will
ask me like in different interviews,
[SPEAKER_05]: like what I think about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the first thing that I'll say
is like for learning breeding and learning
[SPEAKER_05]: like heritability traits, because it's
visual, you can see it, you can act on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times some of these things
like the auto flowering dwarf type plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're so fast to go through the
generations and go through successive
[SPEAKER_05]: generations really fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can learn a lot by doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's like for for people with
small spaces that don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: money for electricity and all this other
stuff that they really want to learn how
[SPEAKER_05]: to breed and breed correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what goes into that?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're perfect for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the best teachers you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the only aspects of our
industry that actually is true breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at gatekeeping and crossing
one to another, it's like this is you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have to do work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the work's already been done
for you because we already have auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower stock to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to create an auto flower
from a photo period and auto cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be also wasteful if you're
making them at scale, because when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: making auto flowers, I would only select
the best of the best plants that got
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated to keep the seed from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else was bird food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would create, I don't know,
a million seeds and keep maybe 120,000 or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, because everything
else was just like traits I didn't want,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants I didn't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want the It's open, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true open, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that to continue into the
next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I leave those seeds behind and that
becomes bird food and everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: carry on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then keep doing that in a very linear
sense, which is generally lost in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis world as far as real food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't like to walk from seeds that
they could possibly sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing, too, is the old
adage who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are buying it and it's not
broken and they want your F1s and they
[SPEAKER_01]: want your seeds and you don't have to do
any actual breeding work to have a viable
[SPEAKER_01]: business or a viable brand or whatever,
then who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why even do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no value added in that if you're
already selling a shitload of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one thing that came to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to change the subject,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I wasn't quite clear on,
how much FEM work do you do relative to
[SPEAKER_02]: regular work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all FEM work now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done any regular work in a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly because the facility I was
working at, there were no male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no need for male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were breeding specifically and seed
making specifically to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple acres outside from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you had male plants in there,
then the value would be instantly lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you'd have to do so much
separation of the males or culling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they ever made it out to the crop,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all FEM work from there, doing some
coursework at the UC Davis Seed Biotech
[SPEAKER_01]: really opened up my eyes of just the value
of FEM work in all breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with cannabis, because you
only have value in the female flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know the traits of the female
flower, it's much easier to predict the
[SPEAKER_01]: heritability and predict what you're going
to get out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Targeted direct breeding at a fast rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've honestly gone completely the other
direction and will probably continue FEM
[SPEAKER_01]: work for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see the value for me in doing
regular breeding today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a novel aspect that people
want to attach to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to get something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the reality of breeding regular
work is that you need to grow out the
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny to know which male to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not doing multiples,
if you don't have space for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all, which is extremely
restrictive, then there's no purpose at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not going to actually do
that, what's the goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the goal is just to get a great cut out
or a clone only out, then why not just do
[SPEAKER_01]: FEM anyway?
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the market, realistically too,
the regular seed market has completely
[SPEAKER_05]: plummeted in the US where it used to be
vice versa.
[SPEAKER_05]: The FEM market was a really hard push when
I was doing it real big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And regular seeds were everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were all these ideas that FEM
seeds were subpar.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would get subpar weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would all be herms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that those are
necessarily as attached as they used to
[SPEAKER_05]: be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to be a much bigger demand
for FEMs in the market now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so many people are doing it and
people are doing big hunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a divergent a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the biggest loss of our community
recently is the genetic availability going
[SPEAKER_01]: to these massive corporations and MSOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a grower for an MSO myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a big MSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a publicly traded one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a startup and grassroots
aspect to it that I can really cling onto
[SPEAKER_01]: and enjoy about what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the price of pounds fell so low,
everybody started selling their genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you got loose grips, loose grips
sink ships, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the whole industry is tanking
because of the availability of everything
[SPEAKER_01]: is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that, though, I think a lot of
those MSOs and larger outfits,
[SPEAKER_01]: they do see the value in FEM seed and
being able to run large numbers and make
[SPEAKER_01]: selections for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've sold a lot of them seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll pull out an S1 of something
and call it their cut of the same thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I always have to fangle over and
spank them a little bit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other reality that we have today
is that we have people that work in
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing divisions who have never seen a
plant or touched a plant or had anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No idea of the history and the respect and
credit that should be given ahead of our
[SPEAKER_01]: own pumping ourselves up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I heard about in Canada and this
is the first time is like maybe a year and
[SPEAKER_05]: a half ago when I first heard about this
and didn't realize it in Canada,
[SPEAKER_05]: the way the MSOs operate or I shouldn't
say MSO is multi territory.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they're called over
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like it's the buyers work for the
government and they're not people who
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke or have any knowledge about
cannabis, but they're the ones choosing
[SPEAKER_05]: which strains get grown in their country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it blows my fucking mind like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who's determining, but essentially
it's determining what clones get saved and
[SPEAKER_05]: held over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's people that have nothing to do
with cannabis doing that because like we
[SPEAKER_05]: saw in the States as things as rains
tightened and as cookies and gelato and
[SPEAKER_05]: sherb became more in demand, there became
a point of where people that were keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: these moms rooms had to make that
conscious decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I keep spending money on electricity
and time and energy and soil, medium feed,
[SPEAKER_05]: all that to keep these moms alive that
nobody's buying the bud for anymore?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like that really happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that led to a great drop in genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, and then you have people
that are non cannabis people in charge of
[SPEAKER_05]: whole countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, that I guess, you know,
there's no risk anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a job at this point,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to all kind of live with the times
and do our best to lightly educate or pass
[SPEAKER_01]: on the knowledge that's important,
pass on the understanding that there needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be some credit given to the
trailblazers who literally gave up their
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom in life for us to even be in this
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's probably a fool's errand,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what we try to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a fool's errand.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to like self-flagellation a lot
to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's the good fight,
though, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's something I think it's just
stubborn, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can respect that, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stubborn and ego is what everybody would
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got I've got one of those questions
from Pico right now, since we're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: in the broader, you know, broader
reflections, I guess, on the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on the modern
dream?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to diversify it as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little depressing because it's not
my flavor, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my fickle nature, my flavor today
is not my flavor tomorrow anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can appreciate I can appreciate the new
the new guard of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always just go back to there's got
to be something interesting and different
[SPEAKER_01]: is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the same is not interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's where I lose interest
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing if I go back to my
history, like just growing ology all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time is extremely boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I would fucking kill to have that OG
cut and be growing that just for my
[SPEAKER_01]: personal smoke even because it was fucking
killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I talk about last several episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get hit up daily by other breeders like,
Hey, did you keep any OG cuts?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got so many now in the stable,
but none of them are hitting the button
[SPEAKER_01]: the way I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and honestly, some of what we're doing
in the indoor grows, I think has taken
[SPEAKER_01]: away from that flavor profile,
like being as true as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure the viroid and, you know,
those sorts of things are playing a role
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lot of this and just general pathogen
in the modern gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm trying to do with our with our
operation is really establish a clean
[SPEAKER_01]: plant program, which is mostly starting
from seed, you know, and not intermingling
[SPEAKER_01]: those with cuts that might come in from
whoever or where and and for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the only way out from the viroid or
from other pathogen issues is just to
[SPEAKER_01]: start from seed, keep really clean plants
and and always have something unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really serves our purposes of at
the end of the day, we're trying to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: sell weed to and having unique things in
the market is always going to help because
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the day, we are competing
against everyone that has the same list of
[SPEAKER_01]: clones, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it just becomes milk toast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you have is buyers that are
just price shopping, because it's all the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got the name and nobody can see it
or smell it before they smoke it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're just price shopping for who's
going to who's about to go out of
[SPEAKER_01]: business, who's going to give me the
cheapest price to liquidate their,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, absolutely, cherry gelato rents
or whatever the fuck it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little I mean, as much as I say
that, I still see so many people doing
[SPEAKER_01]: good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people putting out new interesting
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many people continuing to try to
diversify the gene pool and try to do what
[SPEAKER_01]: I would consider the right thing for the
plant and being good stewards of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by just continuing doing their
own path and making and marching forward,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, endlessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe it's better than it used to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like there's more good weed today
than I think there has been in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also why the price is dropping
down to nothing, because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what legality really did was it
just took away the threshold of risk for
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so even people who are doing it,
you know, in the rainbow market or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, the risk is a thousand times
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Sonoma County, for instance,
they if we were completely illegal last
[SPEAKER_01]: year, doing things totally illegal,
had no licensure whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one hundred thousand dollars a
day fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were close enough, if you were
close, you could have 10 fucking acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were close enough to your
harvest window and you got like a
[SPEAKER_01]: multimillion dollar crop, then that's
fucking worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you if you were licensed and legal,
you were facing I think we had at one
[SPEAKER_01]: point we were facing four X and fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had four hundred and something
thousand dollars in fines pending for
[SPEAKER_01]: because we had an emergency situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a storm and we had to harvest early
and throw it in a building that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up amassing hundreds of thousands
of fines just because that building wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: properly licensed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the weed was accounted for.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the metric tags were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the weights were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was done to show that there was
no like divergent of this crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we could have done it illegally,
made way more money and never had to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: any of the fucking taxes to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, I don't know,
it's it's really like open this market up
[SPEAKER_01]: into an interesting way where no one has
to risk it to, you know, to get gain out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fucking everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even worse than the gene pool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the players of today are the real
stain on our industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I talk to people about legality,
like, you know, there are a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: that aren't big in the cannabis world,
like my family members.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking to me about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try to explain it to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way I explained it is it became
more legal for rich people to grow and
[SPEAKER_05]: more safe for rich people to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there were a lot of
advantages necessarily to the smaller
[SPEAKER_05]: growers, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think any big advantage came for
the home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, maybe less, less, less beer at
night, sleeping, which is it is a big
[SPEAKER_05]: thing in that sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also have less beer because you're
getting pushed out of the business and you
[SPEAKER_05]: need a new hustle anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's the way I look at it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other broad reflections on the
industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you kind of did touch on white
labeling a little bit or an implication,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to talk to that more
explicitly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I'm opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm open to talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's something that, you know,
we've discussed as I think somewhat of a
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary thing, depending upon what an
outfit's needs are and how they're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow their business and what their
business model looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done white labeling for other brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any issue with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two sides to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the viewpoint is that,
oh, you're not doing your own work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're a bad breeder or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is that it also opens up a
lot of time for those individuals to work
[SPEAKER_01]: on other efforts that are going to
continue their business along and not be
[SPEAKER_01]: bogged down by the actual production of
the seed part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be like the same thing as hiring
someone to run your grow, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's you know, you're going to hire
someone to come take clones for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to affect the overall
outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still doing all the direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still telling me what they want,
how they want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're giving me plants, you know,
nine times out of 10 to do the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: work that they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have skill and will
travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what a lot of that's what the
bank was about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: The bank was about essentially helping and
aiding and it was about selling seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that was the platform in order to
sell seeds and it went through a white
[SPEAKER_01]: labeling thing, happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we see a lot of extractors and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they kind of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it has become really, really
difficult and expensive to sort of build a
[SPEAKER_01]: brand and get out there and start
something new now because I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my you know, I've been working for
a long time, but I haven't really self
[SPEAKER_01]: promoted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not good at Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a marketing guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: By any means, I try to do good by that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the mass appeal has evaded
me, I think, in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of my work is more real than it
is fluff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's actual good, strong plants
that are genetics that will yield for you
[SPEAKER_01]: and produce time and time again,
have great vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not just about taking
a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more about serving the broader
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the hype shit is serving
a very, very small amount of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my state, it's probably three percent,
three or four percent of the consumer who
[SPEAKER_01]: actually cares about, like, finding that
hype strain or finding that one in a
[SPEAKER_01]: million or paying, you know, 80 bucks an
eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a tiny amount of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for what we're doing, it's like we got
to sell a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to do that, I need to have a
broad scope of things that are available
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went off on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget where I started with that with
the white labeling thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, it's I mean, it's a part of the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's what happens in Europe to
everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been happening for a long time and a
lot don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, if you want to do business,
there are brokerages which will take your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, make as many seeds as you want for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will package it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will do all the legwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will do all the shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will do everything and they'll pay
you a percentage back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the white label.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my white labeling was a little
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would basically create and then offload
to whomever and they could do their own
[SPEAKER_01]: everything with it after that and just
provide quality seeds to them at a
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, you know, that was still like
seeds were worth about as much as gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sell one of the seeds for like a
buck a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to net me about 30 grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, gold is probably what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty eight right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not watching the spot price,
but it's like seeds are worth more than
[SPEAKER_01]: gold in that terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if white labeling is the thing that
helps to move the needle and allows
[SPEAKER_01]: something like the bank to take hold and
be a driver for the greater good of many,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I see that as a as a solid move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, I was I did white labeling
for a while for others.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't see like I've never seen it as
like a necessary like something evil or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was doing it was for friends and
I'd fly out, do it, make it for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew they were capable of doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just they didn't have the time to do
it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that way I knew they were also
getting a good product and something.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I would put my name behind it,
then I'm sure they they would be stoked
[SPEAKER_05]: with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also about dropping your ego
really hard because sometimes you'll watch
[SPEAKER_05]: what you may be taken and put on a
platform and the other people being like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've seen that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you get there's I am not going to
lie that there is like a slight what if or
[SPEAKER_01]: resentment when you see something that
even if you sell for a dollar seed and it
[SPEAKER_01]: costs you 15 cents to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, which is a great margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they take that dollar seed and
sell it for nine bucks a seed or 25 bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: a seed, which has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, I could have done a little
I should market better because I could
[SPEAKER_01]: have made a lot more money doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, happy to do the
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, no skin off my teeth in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I consider it a partnership more than
just like a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the same way, you know,
our outfit down down in Arizona is
[SPEAKER_01]: partnered up with Dr. Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing all the growing in the
state of Arizona for their brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're white labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come and check up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make sure the quality is on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do every aspect of the work outside
of that and and try to support the
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship and support the brand in the
way that they know that we will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we're partnered up in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the same way, I think any sort of
white labeling is still serving a great
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and if you come at it with an
honorable place and integrity and and the
[SPEAKER_01]: mission for both sides is really good
stewardship of the plant and moving the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing forward, then I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy I got a family to take care
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to have a job in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And pay my bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like last year, I was on the precipice of
taking a job totally outside of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would have been the first time since
20 plus years that I would have been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something outside of cannabis and was
really seriously looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to the Emerald Cup last year
and was like severely depressed at just
[SPEAKER_01]: the downturn, the fallout.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was so few people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the sizes of the booths had gone
from like people had six booths next to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and they were squished in and
sharing one amongst like four other
[SPEAKER_01]: companies all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, oh, my God, what happened
to my industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like a fingernail away from
taking a job that was all the way outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the industry and hanging it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really glad that I didn't because
I was just saying it's more interesting to
[SPEAKER_01]: be in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I learn every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's I believe it's my life's
purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I was I'm here to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As silly as that may sound to some,
I really feel like, you know, I've
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated my life to it up to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to continue on that mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even to get to that point was was kind
of sad as far as the state of the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's I mean, that's passion, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is a reality, too, to the
economic side of white labeling,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it costs X amount if you have a small
or an op to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's obviously going to cost more the
smaller your op to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in reality, a lot of these and why
this whole thing even started in Spain and
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Dutch went there was because of
legal laws, legal loopholes, kind of set
[SPEAKER_05]: it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And over time, people realized,
oh, it's actually cheaper to buy the
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds, repackage them and to make them
ourselves get rid all the risk that comes
[SPEAKER_05]: with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a whole economic side to it
that really drove the market that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it almost made it a necessary part
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that's why that's why the idea of
the bank was more of a conduit to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that at one point with the
bank, with what we were doing and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds we were not only creating,
but also testing and growing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we were probably one of the
biggest seed producers in North America,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not, if not entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were there was a lot of work
happening and it was it was awesome to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we can revisit that at a
later date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Matt lagging out a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a little lag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you're good, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, Matt, I don't know if when you're
back, that's one minute, one hour,
[SPEAKER_02]: 3740, we'll say roughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to offer a kind of paraphrase for
this white labeling topic, like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like both of you are saying there's
nothing inherently bad about white
[SPEAKER_02]: labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with any industry, it comes with
scale at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose what's important here is between
the you know, for the customer,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's about how these products are being
framed, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then between the producer and the
seller, it's about symmetry and some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of fairness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if those conditions are in place,
then white labeling is totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes those are not.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you're paying as long as you're
paying for something and getting what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're told you're being paid,
you're paying for like this genetic says
[SPEAKER_05]: this and that shouldn't be an issue to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's the way it should go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I haven't ever done it yet,
you know, but I'm not saying I wouldn't do
[SPEAKER_05]: it because like the market's crashed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The market's absolutely crashed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and I don't always make them seeds
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and there's an absolute demand
for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just one of those things you have
to be able to present it with what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like these genetics are what we say they
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And transparency is key in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everybody does it that way,
but it's not necessarily on the onus of
[SPEAKER_05]: the people making the seeds to force other
people to behave at the same time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key's been relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they know they can trust me to not
only do a great job and carry it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep up communication, ensure that what
I'm saying it is it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also help to serve their greater
needs, whatever those may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're giving me, you know,
an opportunity, work and happy to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so at the end of the day,
that's what it kind of comes down to for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, no, there shouldn't be an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I think it's awesome that
you get to go through these populations of
[SPEAKER_05]: all these different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only thing I when I think about
this shit, like that's the first thing I
[SPEAKER_05]: think about populations getting to see all
these data points like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, population equals speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get the get to the best
fast, the bigger the population,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can you can run the easier it's going
to be defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean you can't find great stuff
out of 10 seed pops or two seed pops or 20
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've I've done it always under the
sun and I generally I always find
[SPEAKER_01]: something I like and find a keeper,
you know, even if it's just compared
[SPEAKER_01]: against those comps that are in that
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I've done them in numbers of
thousands, it becomes really apparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who the winners are, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least if you're looking at it from
a phenotypic range, like some of it was
[SPEAKER_01]: some of it was growing a huge amount just
to get the data to know that if we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do a real hunt, you know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I got reconnaissance
reconnaissance pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be a sniper with my approach rather
than take a very shotgun approach to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a really cool and yeah,
very, very rich conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably nearing the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: You said Rico.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rico swap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just ignore that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask people like,
what's what's coming up next?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's happening over this next
year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I'm doing I'm helping out a lot
more with the actual marketing for this
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be actually dropping off
some stuff and doing all of my work is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be dropping through the company
I'm working for now, which is the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: shop in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have three retail locations in
Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to those the first Tuesday of every
month and I'm in the store kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: debuting the new selections that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're offering those as like shop
drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to build that up and develop it
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I'm not known there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know my work from anybody
else's and don't have like a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But trying to do it really in a grassroots
way where I can connect with the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer, give my spiel and also connect
our cultivation facility with our retail
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been a key for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the sales and the legal market is
really being able to connect what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do in our ethos as cultivators
with how it's being sold and presented on
[SPEAKER_01]: the retail level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be doing that next Tuesday,
actually, because the new year we fell off
[SPEAKER_01]: and every Tuesday after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with my Fino hunts that I'm doing at
the facility and when we find cool shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when we debut it in the shop drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pepper it out in really small amounts
so that it's going to sell out and not be
[SPEAKER_01]: widely available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then generally, if those strains are
good enough, we'll hit we'll go into like
[SPEAKER_01]: a more of a production mode with them and
not only produce for our brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the other brands that we grow for as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am doing more work on in the vein of the
seed hub, trying to make more of those
[SPEAKER_01]: connections and bring more folks down to
this facility to do the same kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said earlier in the conversation,
it's something I'm really like tiptoeing
[SPEAKER_01]: into everything I've done has been fairly
calculated as far as like risk goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and with having to serve a company
outside of just myself and my own
[SPEAKER_01]: interests, you know, I need to prove it
and make sure it's working for them as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we're trying to build
like kind of the first couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships that we want to enter into
agreements with and get into contract to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the seed production done down at our
facility, do the Fino hunts down there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then hopefully release the flower in
this kind of like shop drop model that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to build up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been a lot of my focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just continuing to not only make seed
and hunt seed constantly and just learn
[SPEAKER_01]: just learn more about the plant as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenges that I have now is really
more about management of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have 75 employees down at the
spot on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so just just that alone is a new
challenge that I'm really trying to take
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and with that, I'm trying to also
there was a guy who was working with
[SPEAKER_01]: before who sadly isn't with us anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is James.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't die or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just went to a different job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, Oh, rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really dire.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to a different job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but what he had set up at the
facility I'm at now was basically a
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership program for some of the younger
folks who are coming up into the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: for the first time and having their first
jobs and kind of teaching them on not only
[SPEAKER_01]: how to behave, not behave, but you know
how you can be a great leader and a great
[SPEAKER_01]: motivator and really build the passion
that we have for this plant into some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other people who are just stepping
into these roles for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just how to be a great leader,
even if you're going to be outside of this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and continue on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's a program that I'm
actually focusing quite a bit of attention
[SPEAKER_01]: on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's a new challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of outside of the industry
while you're outside of the plant while
[SPEAKER_01]: still being, you know, very important in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm really trying to do more
education for the retail and Buntender
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer, not only about things like the
provenance of plants, the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage, the importance of credit being
given to those who came before us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also more education around chemotypes,
plant profiles, the terpene specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use Crybaby's scent kit as a great tool
for education around really debunking what
[SPEAKER_01]: has become a problem as far as the word
terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are used or terms are used in our
industry today and and trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the banana is a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a banana strain where I can show
them a terpene profile, I can show them
[SPEAKER_01]: each individual terp and you can smell it
and tell me when you see that or when you
[SPEAKER_01]: smell the banana, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can bring out the esters that
he has also in the kit and really show
[SPEAKER_01]: them these other things are also
responsible for the things that we smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: taste and just love about the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more education has always been the
move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll continue that this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I really want to I
just want to continue to develop better
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships with my community members
and folks in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think too often, you know,
we get really chippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something we were talking about
earlier, I think, before we started about
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a competitive nature to the
breeders in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that's normal because we're this
is capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're all kind of fighting for
the same share.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing that always brought me to
cannabis in the first place, the thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: love about it, even more so than the
effect that I always enjoyed and smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything else was the camaraderie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that if I was at a random
place as like a teenager and found another
[SPEAKER_01]: person who wanted to go outside and get
high, it was like instant friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just like it is with the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the same shit as me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that really if I boil everything
about the plant down and the community or
[SPEAKER_01]: the you know, the quote unquote community
that we always talk about, that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I do something great, when I create
something amazing that I'm proud of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that I can keep to
myself because my pride of ownership over
[SPEAKER_01]: what I've done is really only understood
when it's shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just continue with that and trying to be
like a better overall person and community
[SPEAKER_01]: member in 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we're at the beginning of the
year, you know, I'm getting sappy with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're all New Year's resolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also I'm also in dry January.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of it is like betterment for
myself and in a growth mindset,
[SPEAKER_01]: always, you know, to just continue to
develop not only the plant and our
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies and our operations,
but also myself as a person, as a leader,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a person who deals with cannabis and
being a good representative for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think both you and Matt shared
that a lot, that kind of community
[SPEAKER_02]: oriented spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, it makes sense like
people are what make things meaningful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you die, alone in your cave with your
special project, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so that's something I shared with
with our with our facility recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at like the serving size of
cannabis, call it an eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we always bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just doing like the math on how
much like material we put out in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the month of November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many if we just take that a total
amount of material, you know, get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts and all the other shit and trim,
whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just look at like our serving
sample size is an eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the facility that I'm running,
we put out two hundred and fifty thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: eighths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like we potentially touch two
hundred and fifty thousand people with our
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to me, like the revelation of
that is so meaningful and so important
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have to serve this thing with my
best intentions and and make sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that they're having because of
my efforts of work is as good as it
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly can be and that I would put my
stamp on it and stand behind it and smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: it with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I think that that's an
important an important point as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how many people we can touch
with this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I happen to be in a very large
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to bring that back home for
everybody else that works with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, you know, that that's a shared
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our efforts every day for grueling at
work is like it's a shared experience that
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're creating is something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something someone's going to get
benefit out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a great way to spend work,
you know, doing something that's also
[SPEAKER_04]: good, doing beneficial to humanity.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my quotes that I've lived by
recently or in the last 10 years or so is
[SPEAKER_01]: just do good and by doing well,
do well by doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I want to have both the moral
good and the I'm doing good to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, aspect to everything I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just try to keep those kind of,
you know, North stars in mind when making
[SPEAKER_01]: any decisions or just going through the
day to day, because it can get mundane and
[SPEAKER_01]: it can get you can get battered down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get negative really easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to stay positive, I just focus on that
stuff and remember that I could be
[SPEAKER_01]: shoveling roadkill off the side of the
road like I was when I was living in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real roadkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, I worked for the Ohio
Department of Transportation for some
[SPEAKER_04]: roadkill skunk, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thousand.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's us more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really even appreciate being considered
for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I obviously love having conversations
offline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just thank you guys so much for even
giving me the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad we got time to sit down and bring
it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any any plugs you want to do at
the end?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything thought you want to leave us with
or projects that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe shine some light on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's nothing really new that I
haven't covered already.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's going to be a lot of new
stuff coming this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really hitting full swing with all
our efforts as far as feno hunting and
[SPEAKER_01]: seed production go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always check out my Instagram at
Pico underscore brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys can see me on the discord or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, open book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to love to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to respond to everybody who wants to
interact with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own discord too, for people who
just want information on the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds that I offer and the strains
that they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always do freebies for them on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime I'm, you know, for 20,
normally people do a lot of sales and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of doing a solo on for 20,
I give something away, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah, I just want everybody to take
away a positive message, try to be good in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2024 to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, remember we're all in this
together, even though we're fighting for
[SPEAKER_01]: market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, we give a nug to a
buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to thank you too,

[SPEAKER_05]: Patreon packs and stuff like that with
your genetics and people are growing them

the guys who's in that patron thing.

[SPEAKER_06]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, isn't that, isn't that weird?

[SPEAKER_02]: I reckon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say that to all the guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like talking nerdy breeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You rank amongst the nerdiest,
the very nerdiest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine having Patrick on with
Dan?

time.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that, I just hope everybody has a
happy new year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's a lot more calm, a lot less
chaos, a lot less humanity, just
[SPEAKER_05]: destroying each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus on the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being negative is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a hater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an active participation to be
positive and focus on that love aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody should try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
