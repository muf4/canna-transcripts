[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Gene?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kicked the show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kicked the show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the kickoff guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the kickoff guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for another Friday night
of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides the normal kick, we got our buddy,
I guess we'll call him Mean Gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I live in the same spot,
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of both lived most of our adult
lives in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of seen all the various changes
that have gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both have a bunch of similar breeding
interests in various aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought it would be cool to,
we're going to do this a number of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we thought it would be cool to bring
him on and talk a little bit about just
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the history stuff that went on in
Mendo, some of the changing of the times
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the stuff that we saw from
long ago and some stuff that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in and we are and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Gene, tell us, tell us about some
of the stuff you saw growing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what are your first memories of,
of strain specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I can tell you, like
originally I remember hanging out like
[SPEAKER_02]: with my buddy, Sy, when we were little and
him like getting bud from his brother and
[SPEAKER_02]: being like, oh, this is, this is,
this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is good, good pot or a good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is bud, you know, check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was before I, he was probably,
he was a year older than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably starting when we were
like, when I was probably like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, eight years old or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was with these dudes who smoked weed
when he was like basic, basically like a
[SPEAKER_02]: toddler almost where I can remember like
riding in the car and like standing on the
[SPEAKER_02]: back seat in a car, you know, allowed on
the 162 on Kovalo road when I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't have been older than like three
or four years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like a year older and people
were passing a joint around the car and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's passing the joint for the adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like taking a hit while he's
passing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember just being like,
like, like it was just the weirdest,
[SPEAKER_02]: weirdest shit to me, but he's just one of
these dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of those dudes who like,
you'll be at the, I remember being at
[SPEAKER_02]: reggae on the river when we were,
I don't know, 20 or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a dude walk up selling acid and him
just being like, dude, I'll eat a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: sheet right now, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me a sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll eat it just so you can watch somebody
do it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was like, his brother was like a
dude who had like always the cool shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the guns and fireworks and fucking
Z28 and the fucking Sirwin Vega 12s in the
[SPEAKER_02]: house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, other shit going on,
you know, and like, so that was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of when I was little, that was kind
of the exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember of like early out and going
places with him, like his cousin's houses
[SPEAKER_02]: and shit where like shit you see in movies
that you're like, you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: damn, like people are, people are like
living like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the kids are straight feral.
[SPEAKER_02]: The adults are like straight party in and
it's a free for all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but like he's always been one of my
coolest friends as far as like just like a
[SPEAKER_02]: super, super cool dude that's always had
my back and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like going back then, I can
remember back then, like as far as like my
[SPEAKER_02]: peer group having weed, but as far as just
weed, like weed was always kind of around,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember being little in here and
smelling people smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you like know that that pop smell like
it's like some someone burning sage or
[SPEAKER_02]: something or usnia or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really know, but you smell it
like, oh, they're smoking pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then getting a little bit
older to the point when actually having
[SPEAKER_02]: like an interest in what was going on and
seeing like a high times magazines and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit like that or a little, a little bit
before high times, probably a year before
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like started, there was, I used to live
up at what's Ariel 101 now, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: originally Czech lodge or grape wine
station.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like, that was the first time I ever
saw indoor was there's this big shed back
[SPEAKER_02]: still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can 101, you can see it's this big
steel building, like just past the creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember going in there and there
was like the, the big parabolic thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: watt lights and seeing these big thin leaf
plants that were like, to me, they were
[SPEAKER_02]: huge, but I was like eight and a half or
nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were probably like, no six feet,
six foot tall plants or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seemed huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember him being like up on a
little platform kind of and then the light
[SPEAKER_02]: being all the way near up by the roof and
being a few feet apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like my first time seeing
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right around then was when my mom
was given that, that Manila envelope that
[SPEAKER_02]: was that had seeds in it to grow indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, you got to have indoor
seeds to grow indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought, which turns out it's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't realize it until like the mid
nineties when I tried growing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different other shit randomly,
which most of it didn't really work out to
[SPEAKER_02]: be that dank, but at least you could,
you could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weed and then all weed was weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't matter if it was as killer as
the Northern lights, but the Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: lights was killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what was in that envelope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom popped a few of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got one plant that was a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: She saved some of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up planting those years later
when I lived in Healdsburg down in Sonoma
[SPEAKER_02]: County, that was like 90,
[SPEAKER_02]: 94, 93, I want to say it was eighth grade
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it had to be right around in that,
in that time period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was, but that was like the
first strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember having where it like had a name
was Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I was a kid, I didn't know
about it, but my mom and her boyfriend,
[SPEAKER_02]: like who's like my dad, George,
they had stuff that they got that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: they got this stuff from a friend out in
George's neighborhood that was the,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the Missouri and they really
liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was talking to George the other
day and he said that about 70 and about
[SPEAKER_02]: 76, he was in San Francisco at the beach
and these dudes had brought back a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds of seeds from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that was the first time he
ever saw Afghani weed, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting to me, because I thought more
like here, the other stories I know are
[SPEAKER_02]: more like 84 Humboldt 78.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was like, no, it was 76.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, that was different than the
Missouri that and that I got from Charlie
[SPEAKER_02]: Brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was telling me that and that was
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's all this time and I still,
you still get new information,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was cool shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he was like, Oh, I wish I would
have, I wish I would have hung on to some
[SPEAKER_02]: of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were really killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Missouri was a much bigger plant
with like the big long buds and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but that was, that was before my time,
but that was, that was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that was, had I been aware of what
was going on, that was stuff that was
[SPEAKER_02]: being grown, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, so then really the Northern
lights was like that first thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I remember that being around and
the first clone I can remember besides
[SPEAKER_02]: that, which is probably around the same
time, if not right at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Willow had just come out the
movie Willow, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like 89, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, this lady's house up in the leg
it, and she had this weed that was purple,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was really cool because to me,
like I'd always seen, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pot, like still what I call pot,
like is like general weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really, not any distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just talking about it's some pot
has some pot, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: She had some shit that was purple weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the smell of that is still what I
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I do all the breeding with the
cherry pie, I'll get these ones where
[SPEAKER_02]: like, when I label my bag so that I
remember what kind of plant it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: the throw like legate purple smell on it
to like, so that I know like, this is that
[SPEAKER_02]: one that's kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that used to pop up with the stuff I
had called the big red too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you really grew a lot of deep
chunk, the sweeter ones, you'll get some
[SPEAKER_02]: that are really more that style.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I even got a lot of that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smelled a flat that a dude had
brought to the Emerald Cup that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was green source gardens
brought a flat of all these Afghanis that
[SPEAKER_02]: were recently imported.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had grown them to see what was in
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them were good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them smelled like cheesy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all different smells,
but a couple of them had that smell that I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, that's like that, that legate
purple smell, you know, and it's easy
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's an early smell, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know what it smelled like the
first time you smelled someone cook
[SPEAKER_02]: broccoli, the first time nail polish
remover, or like, it's like a smell that
[SPEAKER_02]: really stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are like the two oldest things
and that clone resurfaced when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: living out in this neighborhood west of
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a lady who I was staying with
and her neighbor who's a guy who,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I call perp came from, which is the
purple stemmed stuff that wound up being
[SPEAKER_02]: real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both were growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw it and I was like, oh,
this is that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turned out it had come from the
same lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for me, that was a really
long time apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those adults, it was just a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, you know how it is four or five
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, around back in those
days, I didn't see a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember like some brick weed that was
supposed to be that was supposed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if what it was,
but it was very string, very dark,
[SPEAKER_02]: very compressed, not a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people who smoked it would get the
giggles really fucking bad and get higher
[SPEAKER_02]: than a kite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was way different than other like the
other like bricky weed that I've seen or
[SPEAKER_02]: like when I bought like Colombian brick
for 20 for, you know, what, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 bucks a quarter pound or some shit or
100 per pound in Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like go through the whole thing and
you get like a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a little bit of bud and the rest
is all a bunch of garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get high for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wake up with a headache like this
wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, it could have been maybe it
was Thai weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like someone had had put away or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's so that's like going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not a lot of different variety
that I can really remember all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: until 93, 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that era, old school smokers
remember it was like somebody passed you a
[SPEAKER_02]: joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're like if you're like a real
weed head and you really know your shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not like, is this the perps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, is it bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, it's bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's you know, if they're like,
oh, it's shake, you're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, I don't want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back then, the police didn't get
attached to stuff very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was either like, this shit's really
killer or it's not that killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then around, I guess it was around 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been living in Healdsburg for like a
year and it sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to eighth grade down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people were square or the people
who weren't square were skaters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were pretty, pretty soon to turn
into tweakers once they hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: High school later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and then like the Mexican dudes were
really cool to me and the skaters were
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the squares were kind of like this
dude's like you kind of tell us like more
[SPEAKER_02]: of a stoner guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of weird going to a new
school because it was real.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was more of that separation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in a real small town when I was
going to school before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not enough kids for there to
be any separation because you can't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole group of one thing or there's just
three guys or whatever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, I was down there and then I
came back up north and some of my buddies
[SPEAKER_02]: had actually started growing in the bushes
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were they were like carrying
buckets to go to water and stuff like my
[SPEAKER_02]: buddies on Instagram, their OG Foundation
Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and damn, what's what's what's
this thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ancient, ancient future pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and then those guys and our other our
other friend, Nick Rock, was in that
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood and there was like a few my
buddy, little Willie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and there was like a few people who
were out there and everybody was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: into and I went back there and started
hanging out and they were all talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the flavors and they had like they
had like a harvest under their belt and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're talking about oh, we have this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is oh, these are the buds from over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one from over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had named all the plants by the
location like this is this one from the
[SPEAKER_02]: top of the pond or this was this chunky
one or whatever, you know, and then like
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever the seeds were from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was like chunky marks for that
was like from the from from Mark,
[SPEAKER_02]: who was chunky or the plant was chunky and
I never really of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was tall marks which came
from the taller Mark, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the other guy who was taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they had all these different things
and they would be like, oh, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: these ones are tasty and those ones
aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, damn, OK, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really know anything about that
with weed, like flavors and exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just knew like I was to get high and I
would smoke and they'd look at me and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd be like, they'd be like,
you know, why do you make that face when
[SPEAKER_02]: you when you I get like the bitter weed
face, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be like, why do you don't like the
smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be like, no, I mean, you know,
if you kind of cough out smoke and shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all harsh and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I wound up having a little bit of
the northern lights and they smoked it in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, this is tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just been like choking on it,
you know, attention to how they were
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking, hitting it a little lighter,
taking it to the deep inhale, blowing out
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke before you cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the basic things, you know,
you're more seasoned smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was a kid, you know, and so then
that was when I started to then see all
[SPEAKER_02]: the variety and when we would go to
school, you know, we'd smoke at lunch and
[SPEAKER_02]: people would bring the stuff from their
parents and we'd find out what they had in
[SPEAKER_02]: Bell Springs, what they had in Spiroc,
what what this girl's dad grew or what
[SPEAKER_02]: this girl's dad got from from,
you know, Bill Graham presents people give
[SPEAKER_02]: it hooking them up weed because they were
it was the people who were into that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all the dead shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then like then I started to see
more of the variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that time period around then a
little later was when I saw like the
[SPEAKER_02]: effects, which is what, you know,
like I think cross the Mendo P with with
[SPEAKER_02]: the effects to make purple effects,
which became really popular and is in some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the more popular things now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff that we called garlic bud that I
don't know that it was garlic bud as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as the strain, but it was really that
crazy gnarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like even more gnarly than deep chunk
where the the bracts grow like from the
[SPEAKER_02]: center of the bud all the way out,
like they're really long and narrow and
[SPEAKER_02]: caked with resin and inside with the
purple stripes and the crazy funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And around then, too, is when I first saw
like Big Blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, going into the later
90s, we saw monkey balls, which people
[SPEAKER_02]: call deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, then right around then was
when you start to get the clone wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was when we got things like
sweat, train wreck, Mr. Nice Guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Queen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever see Snurvel up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw Snurvel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of it, but we did never see
Snow Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did see what was in the same old time
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a little later was Blue Dream,
Snow Cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one that was really popular and
humble called the Mist, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: supposedly like a Madanuska Mist thing or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people really loved it, who loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now people say it's mid-D.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen much, but it was a
really beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got these really nice buds that were
kind of shaped like this and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: just chunky and covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I crossed that with a Big Blue and I
got a couple of great plants out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: that were really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's because they kind of lean to the
blue side on flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the most outstanding ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really popular and humble for
people to crop that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Nice, train wreck, Green Queen,
kind of a little way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you used to see that Blueberry Skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Sasso had that and guys like Tony
Mendo and Craig and all those dudes that
[SPEAKER_00]: way back when were kind of working with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever see any of that Blueberry
Skunk that he ran?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had one up here that my buddy called
Super Skunk and it was not Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it's Blueberry Northern Lights and
it was very resinous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it smells almost like
Pennyroyal or like a Hina Spearman or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more in that realm of like,
I don't want to say herby, but it's that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a thing where it's like that
really cuts through, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how peppermint is or Pennyroyal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that really like sharp herbal
funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I don't know if that would
have been the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he called it Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew it was Blueberry Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that was kind of a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I don't think that Blueberry
Skunk was related to anything that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry today, you know, in terms of
what became famous and associated with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say like the late 90s there was
kind of like like he was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you, maybe the late 90s, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was really when like the named strain game
really began.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like what he was saying,
I remember stuff where most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: weed was talked about, like where it was
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I mean, like a lot of people
called Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's don't leave that because that whole
year when I talk about all those clones at
[SPEAKER_02]: the same time, everybody was growing
Salmon Creek Big Butt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a possibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, that was a really popular
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the Terps like on that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, plain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people said it was very skunky and
loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to me, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted to me really soapy and good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it was really good weed and
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched those same buddies of mine,
OG Foundation and Ancient Future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched them put in yellow starts like a
foot and a half tall on like by ninth and
[SPEAKER_02]: an average like five pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Off that shit, you know, like it was it
was huge and that was in rows where they
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't even spaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have just kept going and going,
but they were just, you know, gave them
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever four feet of space and they were
five five pound mohawks of buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was a dude who went missing
up here that they called Rasta Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to grow these plants and my buddy
worked for him who now is a cowboy buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, not cowboy buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cowboy Chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he used to work for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they had pictures on their fridge
that were like photocopied pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember looking and being like,
why?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are what's in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something in this picture I don't
see?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, yeah, it's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, where's the weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I only see the trees, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they that's all weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all that is also it's just a golden
field with big old Madrone trees growing
[SPEAKER_02]: in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, that's the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what does this guy pull?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure he was pulling 15,
18, 22 pounds or something off of those
[SPEAKER_02]: because he it was a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of the first people who really
had it and circulated it in Salmon Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was yeah, it was wild, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but that was a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that but that's all to say that at a
certain point, you didn't have to call a
[SPEAKER_02]: big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just say, hey, do you have do
you know, do you have Salmon Creek?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I think that like,
I mean, we used to get and that the other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I mean, maybe I'll like rewind
a bit about a couple of things for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't live up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Area 101 is Tim Blake, who ended up
founding Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his kind of like, you know,
it was right on the highway, right on the
[SPEAKER_00]: 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like a gathering place.
[SPEAKER_00]: He threw like some mini festivals and
parties there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got in trouble with the county numerous
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how many of the first the
first Emerald Cups were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of like a gathering place
north of Leytonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and Reggae on the River is like
right across the border from Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like basically like as soon as
you cross into Humboldt from Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County, you're basically at you're
basically at the festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where everyone would
gather in in the middle of summer and see
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like one of the few things
that would like happen up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and when I was I'm a little
older than than Gene, I came out to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the dead in the in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously there's a connection
between the Bay and Humboldt Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got dragged up there and I have
in ninety four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was ninety four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety five was the first time I came to
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to we went to Reggae on the
River in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like two things that will
stand out for me forever from being from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Midwest and coming from a police
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was a guy walking up and down and
selling buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buds were like in a five gallon
paint bucket with the colas sticking out
[SPEAKER_00]: the top and just like the ability for
someone to like walk around openly and and
[SPEAKER_00]: show weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was so sketch where I came from
was like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if people have never been there,
there's like like the river runs through
[SPEAKER_00]: it right there and you can kind of like
look up and there's like cliffs and where
[SPEAKER_00]: the cliffs are, that's where the one on
one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so they'd have a bunch of
certain parts of it, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'd have a bunch of cops up
there directing traffic and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had friends that were like in the
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got like, you know, riverfront
camping, which is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pulling tubes, you know,
I'm pulling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling a tube and I look up and
there's a cop looking at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like where I'm from is like an
immediate bust.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me go on about my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was like 18 or something like
that, 19, that was like the most shocking
[SPEAKER_00]: thing ever.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That a cop and I could like look at each
other from a distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like he sees me doing drugs,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just waves and goes on about it
instead of like radioing me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like ready to like throw the bong
and run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because that was training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was like kind of like my that
was one of my first inclinations that like
[SPEAKER_00]: living up here was kind of a total bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, was it was really it was a real
bubble, you know, because it wasn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: it was accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had a lot of people would come here
and think that it was like weed was legal
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody liked it and everyone got
along and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was still really
underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still cat and mouse with the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The era that that Gene is talking about
when his friends were starting to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, nobody grew weed like I don't want
to say nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, you grew weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew weed in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew weed in the manzanitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't grow weed like right out your
back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you put some distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people most people would try to put
some distance between their house and
[SPEAKER_00]: where they had their patch because they
didn't want to get raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like he was saying
carrying buckets of water, figuring out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to run water from point A to point B,
even to get your plants fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, back then, you know,
I don't know what prices he was getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but weed was like forty five hundred or
five thousand or more a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got away with twenty twenty five
pounds of shade grown manzanita weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: you had a phenomenal year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, the scale of everything
was different in the sense that like you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have to grow like some enormous
thing like, you know, you didn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow hundreds of pounds to make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you got away with twenty or
thirty, you were set, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the trim scene and all that other
stuff really wasn't that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone was kind of just learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the like like train wreck,
Salmon Creek, Big Bud, the effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: like he mentioned, there was some name
things, but there was still a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say until the purple craze
when when people started demanding uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds, because like with outdoor,
at least from my experience up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: like people would grow the same strains,
but they would mix pounds and mix phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd get three, four or five phenos in
a pound a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that was perfectly
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so you'd have you'd have weed from
the instead of the weed having a name,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be like from whatever town or
area like, oh, this is some white thorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some panther gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from my buddies out on Spiroc,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he mentioned that to Spiroc
and Spiroc and Bell Springs are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: famous weed growing communities,
mostly because they're mountainous and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're way out in the middle of fucking
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis really wasn't like like like
permitted out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like a kind of a cat and mouse
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a few enough people that you
could get away with it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone we know got camp sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there used to be an old joke that
you would like you would plant three
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens and one was for you and one was
the cops and one was for the thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and you hope that one of them came
through in a way, you know, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: could go like same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see you could go, you know,
on on Harvest Moon or whatever went full
[SPEAKER_00]: moons during fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could get people out there
that could go with some contractor bags
[SPEAKER_00]: and they could steal 10 or 15 or 20
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, that was that was a ton of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could go and check on your crop and
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trauma.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the when the clones started
taking off and it was like everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't because, oh, if I have train
wreck, I'm going to get a higher price or
[SPEAKER_02]: people will want my weed faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could sell any weed you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just had to be dried right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had to be mature and it had to be
trimmed good, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was only the only reason people
were growing clones then was reliability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you would grow train wreck,
you knew you were going to get a good crop
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of weed and you liked how it
was to cut down and how it was to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and, you know, it was reliable,
like, you know, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: something good out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you grow the clone and then also
somebody tries this clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work well for them in their
garden or the way they grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they try this other clone and it works
really good for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, OK, so then that's why
people got stuck with the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first clone that carried a premium in
this area was Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Urkel was the one that totally shot
everything to shit as far as the the the
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity, because before that somebody
was like, oh, I like this clone and
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody was like, oh, I like that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Urkel came and it was like,
well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this Urkel you can sell right now for
like forty eight a pound half wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're selling 12 ounce pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, it might be good if you
don't know how to grow it yet and you
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's seven weeks and it's really not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't matter as long as you could
get it to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, it didn't even really matter if
it went purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after just a little couple runs worth
of time going by, if you could get it to
[SPEAKER_02]: get dark, people would show up and they'd
and you'd be like, it's still wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be like, well, let me see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd be like, well, and they'd know
just take that, put it in the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, we'll take it down south and
we'll dry it in our bedroom, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't that it's not going to be a
pound when it gets done because people
[SPEAKER_02]: were so hungry for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's super accurate because before
Urkel, before the purple wave and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four or five was kind of that was
kind of that wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every good type of weed sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was decently well and it was dried,
it was dried well and it was trimmed well.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would just there wasn't a name
strain game.
[SPEAKER_00]: People weren't coming up here with like,
OK, you need to buy X amount of peas and
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be these four strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, go get some good weed and
bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's seedless and it's
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the day it's ready, you know,
it's it's all a matter of if somebody of
[SPEAKER_02]: scheduling, it had nothing to do with
whether or not you could find a buyer or
[SPEAKER_02]: you have the right product or any of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, there's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything would be, you know,
back then it was there was only one big
[SPEAKER_02]: wave of harvest, the outdoor, not the
debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it wasn't this constant thing of
there always being weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be like there would be a bunch
of weed, never a flood, and then it would
[SPEAKER_02]: be all drought for most of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember being like, OK,
it's August or July or September.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like like for Reggae on the River,
we used to save our best, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Foundation got me doing that because
he'd be like, oh, this is my reggae stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, oh, shit, I better save a
reggae stash, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd have like some buds that you came
across through the year that were like the
[SPEAKER_02]: best weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd be like, oh, I'm going to take
two grams of this and set it aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take five grams of this and
set it aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you could show up a reggae on
the river the first weekend in August and
[SPEAKER_02]: have a sack of weed like this,
it was just like epic because people were
[SPEAKER_02]: like, fuck, how do you have that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people would still have
weed and people who were either had the
[SPEAKER_02]: good fortune to have a ton of weed or who
like had certain either connections or
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of connections where they just wound
up with weed in August.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you would have weed, but it was a big
deal in the summer months to have weed
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is this is before cell phones,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's before the Internet or any kind of
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a bunch of people in Humboldt,
so in Southern Humboldt and Mendo,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Reggae on the River was not only like
it was two days back then, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a big weekend of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually meet someone where like
they wanted weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where like everyone you knew grew weed,
for the most part, if you were in those
[SPEAKER_00]: little circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people made a bunch of
connections to other parts of the state or
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever, wherever, you know, because they
would bump into people and like like he
[SPEAKER_00]: was just saying, like, you know,
they'd smoke some weed and they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, my God, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get me more of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you my number and you can call
me after this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, let me try to come up and get a
few pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was like there was so much
demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little bit of indoor going on
for sure, but not nothing in comparison to
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when outdoor came in, I wouldn't even
say it was a flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just more weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it would never flood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would never is just and then it was
unavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like the to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had good weed for years and years,
if you had good weed, you could probably
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it within three to five days of
hitting the bag without too much effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't really matter what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mattered if it was nice or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but the name game, the specifics of
it, like I said, you could get you could
[SPEAKER_00]: sell somebody 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mix of eight different phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was good, it would go fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, you were good and it was
mature and it was it had to be it had to
[SPEAKER_00]: be it had to have some.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but the names and the consistency,
all the stuff they look for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that didn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, there was like
a bunch of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a lot of hill people
that had their random strains that they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: grown for a long time or their friends had
given them, you know, not everybody bred,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, Jean and I have talked
about this before, kind of one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common ways people would breed because
they grew from seed every year is every
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three or four years, they'd be
like, oh, I should make some fresh seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd take all their sex males that
they vegged out in pots before they
[SPEAKER_00]: planted in their holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put those sex males like on some
other part of the hill away downwind,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then they'd have their
females growing in their patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times they would go and
collect male collect male pollen and then
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it back and like brush it on their
favorite females bottom branches from that
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mark them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, when they harvested,
you know, they'd get X amount of hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was their next two, three years
worth of supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until they were like, oh, these are
getting kind of old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running a little low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should do that again this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which if you do the math, you realize that
those those things that are the modern
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, like the most modern weed,
like it's the new it's cookies or it's
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go, yeah, it's probably only really in
a lot of cases was only a handful of
[SPEAKER_02]: generations displaced from origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like a lot of Afghanis,
they're not actually 30 generations after
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them might only be three or four
generations later, because someone's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, shit, my seed seven years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, well, the ship showed up in
81.
[SPEAKER_02]: It showed up in 85.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you go, well, when I was seeing
it, it was 94, 95, 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, shit, somebody only made seed twice
since it showed up from Afghanistan or
[SPEAKER_02]: three or four times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there wasn't even that much
improvement, which was what I was what I
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to say to about like all the
weed back then, you go, oh, it didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like it didn't have to be special.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you saw the weed now that was in
those bags that only had to be dried good
[SPEAKER_02]: and only had to be mature and seedless,
you look at it and you go, what is this
[SPEAKER_02]: one?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like the weed was undeveloped in
a genetic sense or it was unrefined in a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, no, shit was bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually what we have now,
that's our very best stuff is kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: remedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what was then kind of just normal
weed, you know, like because a lot of this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that was in the hills in California
was like really fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything that Amsterdam got was just
them going, oh, whoa, they have crazy shit
[SPEAKER_02]: in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have crazy shit in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have crazy shit in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all that stuff, they took it over
there and then didn't even really have
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with it and and tried to do
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people hit and some people
missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people wound up going,
oh, this modern weed, it had so high in
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, it's so heavy yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, no, the shit that I saw
that was bred twice after Afghanistan was
[SPEAKER_02]: already like what people now look at and
go, oh, it's holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's space weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, that was what that was
what, you know, like that was what came
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not genetics don't work in a way
where traits just miraculously appear,
[SPEAKER_02]: although they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that really good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was already it was already there
in what we were seeing at Reagan on the
[SPEAKER_02]: river and somebody's sack from Santa Cruz
that showed up to sell their pound or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, you know, like stuff was stuff
was crazy, I think probably when it showed
[SPEAKER_02]: up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I would add to that that I was
smiling when he said that because one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the one of, you know, when you apply
capitalism to all this stuff, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the modern breeding is when,
you know, you get some stuff and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, OK, well, I spent a lot
of time and a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a result of me being really
smart when we all know it's like it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of accidents and you're already
starting with good working material to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with, you know, a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole traits out of thin air, you can like
if you want way more resin, there is ways
[SPEAKER_02]: to go, OK, I'm going to take a plant that
gets way more trichomes per square
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeter, and I'm going to take this one
that gets huge heads, but it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: very many combine them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wind up with the best of both worlds
and have something that has way more resin
[SPEAKER_02]: with way bigger heads and your numbers
shoot way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you still have to have those two
traits have to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And separately, they were still pretty
fucking good because you already had one
[SPEAKER_02]: with a whole shitload of resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heads weren't huge and you had one
with huge fucking heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both of them were already pretty good
fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like and in a lot of cases when we find
something that's like that, you're really
[SPEAKER_02]: just finding that plant that already had
the combination in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you you might think you made it
through combination, but really,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you would have grown 200 girls of one
side, you'd go, oh, it was already in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought I made it and then you
didn't fucking make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's like really with all
that, it's really like you're really kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of more discovering than you are creating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to find some good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're not you're not making the
gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just fucking digging through some
shit to pull out some nuggets,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to some degree, that's why the
90s kind of remains like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: backbone of modern breeding was because of
all that diversity, because it was before
[SPEAKER_00]: the name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because, you know, like the last 10
years of breeding, not everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously outliers and people that
do different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in most modern breeding,
it's like take all the most popular things
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find and blend them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully I get a little version that
people have some clout with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, weed in the 90s was back
to be vastly different because there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't pressure on it for it to be the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had to just good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is that it didn't even
have to be pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by good, it's like if it got you high,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're by smoked, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're by.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, people who bought weed
when they showed up, they smoked the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You you could not sell weed without them
smoking a few joints with you and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it burned right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure it was harsh, making sure
their customers weren't going to be pissed
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you could go at some
weed and they can be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, well, let's roll some
joints and hang out for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it was good weed, they I mean,
in modern times, it's like name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, does it have any larve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have nose?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your price point?
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most modern most modern dealers and like
fucking city buyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you guys had to hang out with for
like two hours watching a movie just to do
[SPEAKER_03]: a transaction?
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's like it it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a whole industry of it
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of people that didn't like
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the people that were even the
people that were willing to go to the bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember, you know, going out
Spyrock and you could go talk to people up
[SPEAKER_00]: there that like, you know, that they had
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had big underground indoors and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get weed for like thirty six,
which was dirt cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to tell them that I would like
take it to the bay and I would get way
[SPEAKER_00]: more for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd be like, but you have to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to my driveway and we and I
can be at my house and you give me this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a 22 year old, 23 year old kid,
I was like, that's so dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I go to the city,
and I make my margin and I party and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a great time and then I hit my 30s or
40s or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, man, that makes perfect
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can just come to my door and be
fair and then go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cool because like I got dinner to cook
and I got some kids to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to go all the way down to
the fucking day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then the fair and away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still 50 and eight for most
people, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still three prices when when when
pounds were about to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically six grand wholesale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the it was like, whoa, eights are
worth fucking 50 and 60 dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least pounds are worth six grand to
the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you still pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now people are selling hundred dollar
rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this shit's really not worth any
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the I have friends that joke
with me right now that they can go into a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and they can go buy a six
hundred dollar ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's or they could go buy a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably better for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw six hundred dollar an ounce
weed and it was fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was like, I mean, I understand
maybe that there could be something that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be worth that if it was like really
hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it fucking took 24 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've never tried anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like it's just some bud that
people used to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: For really cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even as good of a version.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like selling for six hundred an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, shit, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the sad part is, is that you would
think with legalization, typically it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes quality go up and price go down
because you take the risk out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's there's a risk
pricing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far with cannabis, the way we've
structured California, it's kind of done
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed in general is way worse than the two
fifteen era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'd be different if you were
producing a molecule, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're producing a molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like at scale, it doesn't really
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get rid of all the barriers and
obstacles and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden you're going to
be like, dude, we're producing this
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule like fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's not illegal anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, we dropped the price to produce
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then but with weed, it's like weed
doesn't scale very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we said we've we've so hard to
scale that even when you go from seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody who grows like like the best weed
that I've ever seen, almost every time
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from people who have like less than
like a dozen lights if they're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the one light is we used to have
a we used to have a bunch of friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: mutual friends that would, you know,
they would work for older cats and they
[SPEAKER_00]: would run these fifteen hundred lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they would come get their headstache
off me because I had a ten lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used to joke that like you just
couldn't get off that hundred light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't get as good a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't give it as much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like the little minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what happened is like
people used to be able to make a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good living off twenty, thirty,
forty, a hundred, a couple hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could treat that stuff right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could dry it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could cure it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have just a few people helping
you and you could do the little things
[SPEAKER_00]: that kept it nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're like, how do I grow these
ten licenses I have and I've got two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand pounds coming down and costs are
through the roof and I have to do OSHA and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what suffers is the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they start looking around at
like what ways they can cut corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's they're not evil
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: By any means, they're just trying to
survive because it's all rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or or they just don't they've grown a
hundred or two hundred pounds their whole
[SPEAKER_00]: career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been happy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get asked to grow two
thousand pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just don't know how to scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, because their system that
they had for them when it was smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: worked amazing, but their system didn't
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you try to scale it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like, oh, I'm just going to double the
recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't really work like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just double recipes,
you know, like you sometimes you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it in batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can have somebody and say,
OK, you're going to do you're going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This many runs and maybe you're going to
get more runs in or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: then people can keep it exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everybody has a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people can scale a lot better than
others because of the way that they do
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as simple as I grow, I probably could
have scaled pretty well because I don't do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything very special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of why I'm able to get
weed that I really like, because I just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's mostly the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I really try to make sure to
really like pay a lot of attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting and drying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it's doable, but it's still I
could still never do enough to be a big
[SPEAKER_02]: brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's I just couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's let's be clear, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I came out here when I was in
my early 20s, so I didn't grow up here
[SPEAKER_00]: like he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my experience is most weed growers
back then were back to the landers,
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies, people that decided to grow weed
because logging ended and they needed a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to support their family.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these aren't people that are
like amazing at logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these aren't like like sergeants
that are like, OK, you three do this and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the efficient way to do that and
this and that and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just figured out some kind of way
that works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at a small or medium scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you try to like commercialize
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, their experience is
only so good at that part, because now it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it becomes like, you know,
like now you're a conductor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're trying to like move the
orchestra around and like you're used to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just winging it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and even when stuff becomes
really super competitive in that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of a thing, a lot of the people
it's like back when weed was rare,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you got weed and it didn't suck and it
was good genetics, you were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, this is really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when things get more and more
competitive, a lot of the people,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, who you're like, oh, they have killer
weed and like it's it's like you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, but is it like is it really that
killer?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has to go up against people who are
so knowledgeable and are going,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, you know, this you got to have
this particular watering schedule and this
[SPEAKER_02]: dryback and all these different like very
specific parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, it's like,
yeah, their weed was really good,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not it's still not competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying that's everybody,
but that's a whole section of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, where all of a sudden now when
there's a huge flood, you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, this weed is just not like there's
always been people who who would would be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, dude, I have this weed and I'd
look at it and I'd be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: cool, it's it's nice, you know,
but at the same time, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not competitive, though, you know,
and it's something that I can't I like
[SPEAKER_02]: can't bring myself to tell people that I
just am like, yeah, it's it's good,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but like you you kind of you
just kind of look at the reality and you
[SPEAKER_02]: go, fuck, have you seen what people are
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we some of us have always been able to
do it like like I was saying, like people,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know ladies who had one light or two
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time they would have weed,
you just be like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, people doing all the most
scientific tricks, they can't they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: do any better than these ladies with their
two lighters or their four lighters or
[SPEAKER_02]: their one lighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still the best weed ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was never everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a point when if you had
weed, you were like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the funny thing, like with
with especially with old school growers
[SPEAKER_02]: and growers in general, everybody always
thinks their weed is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've never met.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only met probably a couple of people
who can look at weed objectively and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, it's good because of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I missed here and I missed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this would have been a little better
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to really be objective and like and
logically look at stuff, it's generally
[SPEAKER_02]: like this is my mind and it's the best,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's really, I think,
been something, too, that is a big barrier
[SPEAKER_02]: for people to get past to be able to look
at stuff and go, well, fuck, maybe I need
[SPEAKER_02]: to maybe I need to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to ask people more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to be able to look at this and be
able to and be able to like tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between what this one is and
what that one is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do I make mine look like that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because mine looks like this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, you know, that's an
important part of really doing any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: process to really break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you go to a restaurant and
they're not really doing very good
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, dude, people want food,
especially like here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I've seen like all these
places like pizza places or whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we make great pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's buying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: People fucking buy great pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't have to twist people's arm
to buy a fucking pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't want your pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only your pizza be the pizza
people want is to like ask somebody like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, how do you can I maybe like get the
starter for the dough?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, how do you do your dough
and what temperature is your oven and what
[SPEAKER_02]: is in your sauce?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get the recipe for your sauce?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like those little things
and what's I made it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: What went wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, like in this
area and not so knows this, if you had
[SPEAKER_02]: good fucking pizza in where I live,
you would stay in business for fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would make it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been every pizza place has
come and gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are good here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, it's like, OK, you go there and
you go, oh, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just an analogy to what's up
with weed, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you really have to fucking
constantly try to figure out what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you were one of the people who
just happened to fucking make some shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it came out really good and everybody
loves it, then fucking go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the recipe works, it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's not working, you got to know
when to look at it and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: ah, what what do I need to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever watched like what's that bar
rescue or those shows?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Gordon Ramsay comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, no, dude, we're going to make a
fucking bruschetta and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to put tomatoes on it and
balsamic vinegar and some fucking basil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are making this fucking crazy
concoction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody likes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look at it fucking simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stop doing all this weird shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same with the with weed and
the weed market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just it's it's a weird it's
a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's so much that is done on
that level and so little that's done on
[SPEAKER_02]: the really crazy level that, you know,
it's it's like I'm convinced if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: really still on that level that people
still want your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're just a little bit below it,
it's like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that working, too, is tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's an aspect where people
kind of went from like trying to grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed they possibly could,
which never happened exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's a lot of people
that like, you know, now they just try to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow like decent commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're trying to grow decent
commercial at scale and like the and the
[SPEAKER_00]: decent commercial is rough, you know,
and so like the name strain game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason why, like, you know,
the purple craze happened and then right
[SPEAKER_00]: after that, the Kush and the sour and and
and cookie and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason why that exploded so
much in our area was because people wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to just give the broker what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if the broker was like all 58 of
these look good, I'll take them all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then they look at this other
guy's stuff and he's got some nice stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and they end up taking 10 when he leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that had the variety looks at the
dude that got cleared out and was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: can I get that from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get the thing that the dude is
going to come and clear me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that is, I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and I'll try to figure out
a way to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sourdough starter for your
crust, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the fucking sauce right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, then that's what's funny about
Urkel is that there was a time in which
[SPEAKER_00]: there was an endless demand for indoor
Urkel from our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically like every big grower I
knew, ran indoors of Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the purple craze ended and
it went on to sour and Kush and these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things, fast forward 10 years and
there was like six dudes that held on to
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we both knew dozens and dozens of
people, everyone had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was red.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what if you had weed like
probably Urkel or a very type of weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there was blue dragon and purple
Nepal and grape ape and but it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: purple with the sweet fruit loopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's also that we should
mention, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also that kind of thing where like
that craze was one of the first times
[SPEAKER_00]: where people wanted to give their own name
to something, whether it was different or
[SPEAKER_00]: not or whether it was just a slight
variation or a bag seed of whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There had to be GDP and great and great
babe and purple Urkel and purple dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and platinum purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and it was like this thing
where it was like people there was like
[SPEAKER_00]: the start of people wanting to
differentiate their little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because the name had worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, well, people you say it's
purple Urkel like everybody, everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: wants it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the names were really working
and it was the same like in L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had some weed that was really good,
you just call it such and such Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to combine the two, when the
purple craze ended, people were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, people don't want this Blackberry
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should call it Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because the Kush name was this is
the this is the purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like that Kush you want,
but darker Blackberry is actually a strain
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So different than Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was also a purple flow cut up
here that finished in early September that
[SPEAKER_02]: was originally purple flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this stuff must have been,
I don't know, like five percent THC or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't get high off it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled really nice and sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled really similar to what the
Blackberry clone was, but it turned darker
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was done so early and fast and it
got tons of these huge buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody started calling that
Blackberry Kush and online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of people call that one
Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, that was the purple
flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was purple flow for like maybe a year
or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, everybody went,
it kind of smells like that Blackberry
[SPEAKER_02]: clone and the Blackberry wasn't very
stony, but it wasn't as no stone as this
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking flow clone, this flow clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like you could not be high off this
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and then after a while, then that
became the Blackberry clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask people like, so the one
that didn't get you high at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: this Blackberry, I'm like, when did it
finish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the other one was like early
October.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was still very fast and would want to
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one had thin leaves and it was
very purple, way more purple, where the
[SPEAKER_02]: other one was very frosty and pretty,
almost like a bubba, but with a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger features.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tasted really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't get you that high, but people
didn't give a shit because you smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: something else to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one came in and it got
really big for like two seasons here and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, everybody was
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm literally like not getting any fucking
effects from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect that he mentioned it
before, but there's an aspect we should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably talk about when when the name
game happened in the beginning of any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these name games that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has the name and it's and it's
similar or the right cut, it just all goes
[SPEAKER_00]: like if it just went right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as more and more people get it,
the quality has to be nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes people would have a hard
time getting like purples to turn purple
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of summer because their
rooms would be too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't like people didn't have
great like environmental controls back
[SPEAKER_00]: then or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd get some like green purple
that was like harder to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that's kind of like what
happens when like when a market starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: get saturated with a particular strain is
like the best versions of it still go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it loses that like if it's it,
it goes because like early on,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had Kush or you had sour,
you had purple or whatever and you had it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as more and more people got it,
quality became more important and you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually had to have like really nice
version of it for it to go as easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's kind of like that's
there's an aspect to it where it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he's right in the sense where,
you know, the name game happens and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: gets stuff gets all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really is like, you know,
if you've been around for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see a lot of similarities in
today's weed mashed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really old weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we really actually haven't
gone all that that far away from things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've mashed it up in various different
ways and we've added all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: different names, which is kind of
obscures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really haven't we really haven't
like people think now weeds better than
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of probably just patting
yourself on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, weeds been really good for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just mattered whether or not you had
access to really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people have access now than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that weeds any better
than it is before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in fact, it might have been
better 20 years ago on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, average, I would probably have
to agree with what we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then there's another thing,
too, when it comes to names and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, where it's like, obviously,
we're in like the the marketing era where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything has to be candy or cake or or
desserts or sugar or evoke some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, back then it was like,
you know, he mentioned it before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like you could get some weed that like
gave you like brow sweat and you'd call it
[SPEAKER_00]: the sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even saying that's it,
but that's like how a lot of names came
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody would name nobody would name
anything sweat today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody would name anything dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody name would name anything like
there's a million names that would they
[SPEAKER_00]: would never work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, the Mendo P that I
found, you know, I didn't know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was, so I just called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was purple from Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became Mendo purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point, I was talking to my
buddy who showed me some weed that was
[SPEAKER_02]: really bomb and it was like it was kind of
smelled to me like a mix between like what
[SPEAKER_02]: I call the legate perp smell and the and
like the the purple oracle smell in a
[SPEAKER_02]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my buddy was like, yeah, I got this
from this guy on Bell Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he's the guy who because at one point
people were saying, oh, Urkel is just a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant from the Mendo from the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd never seen the perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my buddy showed me the buds and I
was like, damn, this is bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some kind of bomb Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy was like, yeah, I'm the I'm
the guy who that that the Mendo perps came
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's funny is I don't even think the
guy was lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he heard about the Mendo perps
that was yours that got popular and that
[SPEAKER_02]: people were rumoring Urkel came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his weed, he probably had called Mendo
perps because it's a pretty vague fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like black Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very, very vague.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it would or like Big Bud or you
know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Snow Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these things could easily be reused
by somebody like imagine now when you try
[SPEAKER_02]: to name strains and you Google it,
people come up with the same fucking idea
[SPEAKER_02]: for a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, even it was even regional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like you just said, Snow Bud,
like if you got Snow Bud from Eugene,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the Eugene Snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got it in the Humboldt,
it was the Humboldt Snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got it somewhere else in Oregon,
it was called Oregon Snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Humboldt guys and the Eugene guys
and the Oregon guys all thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: theirs was the first one and everyone else
got theirs later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it's where they saw it
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so I was talking to Caleb at
one point and I told him about that guy
[SPEAKER_02]: and I asked him like about like the perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just curious because he he
seemed to have done a lot of work with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, dude, the Mendo perps is totally
different than the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even in the same ballpark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no way that there's any truth
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same as like when one of the
first times I really bullshitted with them
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the show, I was like,
yeah, I go when I was in Maui in the late
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s or the early right around 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere in there, there was this weed
that my buddy Lance used to always have
[SPEAKER_02]: that he called Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was always like, this is the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was always like, damn, this is some
fire fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't really familiar with any of
like the cam and the diesel and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit came later for me because I wasn't
seeing a lot of clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was seeing more, like I said,
that lineup of the humble clones,
[SPEAKER_02]: those more like commercial ones that were
around and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I remember talking to Caleb and
being like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I might because this is after I've
been reading shit online and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, it might be the it might be
the the original dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure because these dudes were
in Oregon and they were in Maui and they
[SPEAKER_02]: had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then years later, I was able to talk
to my buddy Gabe from over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, no, I know the dude who had
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says that he found it in a bag of
chem dog 91 and he found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he popped it and they call that the
dog in Maui.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was right around that time
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right, well,
that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the names are so trippy because them
just going, oh, we got it out of chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to call it dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get that weed and then you hear
the stories and you're like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: so is it that and it's so easy to like
think that that could be the real lineage
[SPEAKER_02]: and then be like, well, no, because this
information disproves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep track of all of it, to go,
OK, and then it turns out, fuck that dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really good fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years and years later,
Caleb runs a bunch of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of rooms of chem 91 s ones and a
bunch of them look like that Maui dog cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course, because, you know,
so it probably was like you could put some
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures that he took right up against
some really nice pictures of that Maui dog
[SPEAKER_00]: from ninety nine or two thousand or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could imagine it being bag seed
coming out of coming out of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's one of the things
like that's one of the coolest things to
[SPEAKER_00]: me about s ones is when if you just if you
do that, you can if you do an s one
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've gone up there and I've seen,
you know, half a room of of Urkel s ones
[SPEAKER_00]: and half a room of Mendo P s ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell just by if you're a
breeder at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That these things are not related like you
don't see any similar expressions
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same thing with this feed
that was that he was calling Mendo perps
[SPEAKER_02]: and saying, oh, I made the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think that he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this shit was some nasty Mendo
perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just was not Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the same thing to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still like, fuck, I wish I could get
some of those seeds because they were
[SPEAKER_02]: these buds that were like way chunkier
than any of this other stuff and a really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool, obviously Afghani, probably pure,
really sweet, really nice, but probably
[SPEAKER_02]: totally unrelated to both strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But like not not without value,
just because it has a funny name or a
[SPEAKER_02]: funny story, you're still like,
fuck, I want to get my hands on that on
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, at this point, it's
probably gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's probably from now from from a
long time ago, he probably like,
[SPEAKER_02]: ah, purple went out the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in the purple craze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we probably started growing
diesel and didn't even keep the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because I mean, it's I mean,
the purple craze had what, 15 or 18 year
[SPEAKER_00]: break between when it was hella popular
before it got hella popular again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifteen years, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went, you know, oh, five, oh,
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cookies, cookies brought back
purple weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2011, teens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so it really only took a little
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as like Urkel type purple,
even sweet purple like gelato,
[SPEAKER_02]: it took between Urkel and gelato to be
back where people wanted sweet perps and
[SPEAKER_02]: not doughy perps or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so missed a big era where there were a
few of us like me and Bodhi and a few of
[SPEAKER_03]: us that were only doing purples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we didn't let it die,
but it definitely died down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean in the sense what I was more
speaking of in terms of like, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: market demanding it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it went away, but like there was
an era when we were talking about like in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid 2000s where like purple,
like purple weed was the thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone wanted purple weed and like
purple weed never went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I would say the last couple of
years, all of a sudden all my friends have
[SPEAKER_00]: been like, well, I guess purple weed is in
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say my weed, you know, I haven't
heard, I haven't heard, oh, this is fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like not purple enough in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what you used to hear about
that summer grown Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be able to know it's Urkel,
but it like, it didn't, it didn't darken
[SPEAKER_00]: up on you, you know, like it didn't get,
cause it was hot in summer, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it'd stay kind of greenish and they're
like, oh, it's not quite purple enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darks, that's green grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purple craze too is interesting
because it was the weed that made people
[SPEAKER_02]: want it initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't so much that it was purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really popularized stuff being
purple for a while, but it's trippy
[SPEAKER_02]: because like we in Mendo, there was always
a lot of purple weed all the way back
[SPEAKER_02]: because the purple in a lot of cases comes
out of these old Afghani types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people had purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that it wasn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that there was no premium on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were like, some of them are green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are 50, 50, and it didn't
really matter at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people had, had like real
varieties that were like, they're purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this shit is purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Jed and his dad, they had like
this purple that was just straight solid
[SPEAKER_02]: purple and it ran really late and it was
really peppery and dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so might know these guys they're from
between like here and, and Willets,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was like the most purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was so saturated, you know,
but that's like also how like big blue
[SPEAKER_02]: was, which I saw as early as the,
as the mid nineties, you roll a joint,
[SPEAKER_02]: you lick the paper and it bleeds through
and the whole paper turns purple where you
[SPEAKER_02]: lick it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then even that way back before
that, like you asked me, what's the first
[SPEAKER_02]: weed I can remember like 1989 was a common
popular clone, which when I say common and
[SPEAKER_02]: popular, I'm from a small area with a
group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's popular and common if it comes
from Legate and Willets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean that there's two,
it's not like now where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, it's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking all over the States or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just means that like it made its rounds
and it wasn't just one or two families
[SPEAKER_02]: that had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually something that was like,
you know, it got around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as far back as the eighties,
there was already a clone that was around
[SPEAKER_02]: and that people were really liking that
was like, it was purple and it was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a red or purple as opposed to a
blue or purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fucking pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of the weed that would turn purple
just naturally, there was a lot of Afghan
[SPEAKER_00]: blended stuff in Mendo that would turn
purple with the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it go, if it got a light frost
or something in October, especially if you
[SPEAKER_00]: took like all your people used to take
their, their first, what we call the first
[SPEAKER_00]: cut and they would take all the big tops
first because you were scared of those
[SPEAKER_00]: rotting, you know, and you wanted to get
some money in the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would let your seconds,
your second and third round sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, and you, and you'd
want those to ripen up a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times those would go
through some more cold nights and those
[SPEAKER_00]: cold nights would bring out that like
latent Afghan, you know, purpleness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like weed that just turned
purple naturally in most conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like, that was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a lot of weed that if
you grew it outdoor and you let it run
[SPEAKER_00]: late and it went through some cold weather
that it would turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took some like in the thirties
nights to make it pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being too like basically overdone
and created and not really that good a
[SPEAKER_02]: weed at that point, like a real purple,
a real purple weed has to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could like grow it indoor and it'll be
purple or you can grow it outdoor and cut
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it turns to shit and it'll be
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even Urkel outside didn't like to get
purple as much indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easier to get it purple and outside
it for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen this with a lot of things
like Hindu inside would get a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: purple, but outside it would never get a
touch of purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it could, I don't know if it's
like the spectrum or what it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I know it's not just cold because
indoor you're usually have it more
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but Urkel was one of those ones where
it wasn't that great in the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very kind of hairy on the inside
and it would like to start to get a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of mold outdoor if you were not in the
greatest area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would have to cut your real
big chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you left, you would leave
the small buds like he's saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they would turn really dark and
it would be like your little buds that
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if some of them were little like this
that weren't trimmed very well,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it would be really dark and people
would be like, those are the ones we want
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people wanted color at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, that, but that was like the time
when color mattered was with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas before that it was like,
yeah, purple, you know, green is a bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we want darks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, that was a weird time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start looking into nowadays,
what you're working with up in Mendo now
[SPEAKER_03]: currently, Gene, like what you're seeing
around the scene nowadays, as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding goes, what you're finding around
nowadays that you're enjoying breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: with?
[SPEAKER_02]: First thing that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some people who have cool things
that are from back in the era we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about where they, they used to
have cool stuff and then you talk to them
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're like, they were actually like
into plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've kept things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's like cool little things
here and there that kind of pop out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always try to like check them out
just to see if, cause every once in a
[SPEAKER_02]: while, something's really, really dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like for the most part, I really try
to focus on like digging through the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know that I haven't done a good
job of really exploring all the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: I make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'll make a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll, I'll pop whatever looks
really the most attractive right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: All breeders that do it for a while have a
pile of one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your instincts aren't always going to
be correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I'm always like, I try to avoid
trying to pick up too much stuff here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to kind of like take what I
consider to be my ones that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: like the backbone of what I've done and
then do out crosses with them here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there to make cool stuff, but then keep
really trying to like focus on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those ones are like, like pina,
grape soda, skunk, the Jaro and root beer
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, which are kind of almost the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lime stuff, which is really my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have like the various cush
lines that I do that are more like the OG
[SPEAKER_02]: type stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like the more little odd,
like the sky cuddler Kush or sky cuddler
[SPEAKER_02]: double Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those ones are all ones that I try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to like find what's really the
best in them and take them those
[SPEAKER_02]: directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I put out a little bit
of them for other people to do the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing when they're a little looser so that
it's not all left up completely to me
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, this is where it should go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause some people they like, everybody
likes something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody wants to, somebody wants the
straight OG one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I like some influence from
the OG, but OG is a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not really making anything if I
make this OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like have it where I did one,
not so saw a little bit of the OG work
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was doing when he was up last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like very, it's very kind of targeted
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of reached that point where
it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high, I like a little bit better than
OG just, but some people maybe wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: because they want the more real intensity,
but it's a little bit more clear I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, I just, I'm always
trying to like figure out really narrow it
[SPEAKER_02]: down, but those ones that I named are like
the ones that go back the most and that
[SPEAKER_02]: have been the most well-received and that
I've explored the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's fucked up is that like in those
same years when I made all this different
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, there's all these other things that
I didn't ever even try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a long time and then not so knows
how it is here, like you could make a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you weren't on the internet,
like who's ever going to want to grow all
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're like thinking you're doing all
this shit for nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, you kind of just feel
like a geek, like doing weird shit for no,
[SPEAKER_02]: for like no end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is ever going to, I can only get
to some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to grow anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't fucking know anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only know these few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have like these few friends,
like my buddies, his mom grows them for
[SPEAKER_02]: medical and kills it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my one buddy couldn't get clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he decided to do a big run and then he
killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants more seeds and you know,
like there's these little pockets here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but like I wasn't on the internet
until 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like forums, my buddy reservation labs
who used to work with me up here,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's not from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish I would have known he didn't
ever talk to me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he knew about forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, he got all this shit for me,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was one of these funny things
where I was like, I wish I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking like, there was no, there was no
reason for it to come up really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than it said you should do,
but you know, I was like, I was just like
[SPEAKER_02]: doing weed shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, what do you want to be on the
internet for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that'd be, he probably thought I'd
think he was sketchy for being on the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like probably say like, where like you
live up here and I would say that probably
[SPEAKER_00]: like people have, uh, people have a lot of
misconceptions about what it's like to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually live up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, our bubble is, is,
is really weird in that regard and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be really insulated and like
everyone, you know, my, everyone that you
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out with for the most part might grow
weed, but that doesn't mean that like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tied into the larger community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, you know, I, I kind of call it
when I got on IG, you know, I did the
[SPEAKER_00]: forum thing along time ago, but then I had
a break and I kind of felt like I crawled
[SPEAKER_00]: out from under my rock because we,
I was just living that like Mendo life,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I wasn't trying to the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, however you want to put
it, however you want to put it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but you know, even with,
with him, with seeds, it's the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: with me with, you know, people ask me
about my collection of, of clones and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: tended to try to keep things that I like,
but it's a total bitch because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's talking about trying to get friends
to, to grow his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me getting friends to back up my strains
that aren't currently popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, even when times were
easier four or five years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: people wanted to have them mothers of the
things they were currently blooming for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to back up a bunch of
stuff, you know, and then it would have
[SPEAKER_00]: got, get popular again and people would be
like, Hey, do you still have that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that thing that you had was super
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ended up like having people back
up stuff for me, but I try to like stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: it with people that actually love the two
or three or four cuts that go their
[SPEAKER_00]: direction because I'm like, Oh,
if they love it, they'll hold onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think there's an aspect
now and I don't exactly know how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change, but I would say like
maybe five or six years ago before the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the maybe, when would you say,
when would you say gene, the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: it started getting blown out bad about
five years ago, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before even the legalization started.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a year or two, but for
seeds, at least there was a thing where
[SPEAKER_00]: like Emerald cup and some of these
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: As, as you guys both know, there was a
bunch of growers with extra money in their
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would come to these things and they
would want to get some fresh seeds and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of outdoor growers wanted to grow from
seed because there was this idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds got bigger than clones and so on and
so forth, you know, and we had more vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people were a little bit more
willing to experiment, but now it almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like there needs to be like some kind of
change in the regulations or laws because
[SPEAKER_00]: like the nurseries just want to grow
what's popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they want to sell popular clones
to people that have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to grow flower and those guys
want to grow what's popular because they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't even sell direct to the public nor
can they sell direct to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to convince a distro to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that distro, you know,
has to, um, you know, has to come back
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, and decide to sell that to like a
shop where the days where, where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Gene could have a friend go into
a, into a shop in the Bay and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some, I've got a couple duffel
bags of some fire weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you interested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so even, even any breeder,
whether it's, it's him or you or Caleb or
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else, even just getting someone to
be able to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone to care about, you know,
somebody could grow a bunch of his stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like, Oh my God, this shit's fire,
you know, or, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, the distro is like,
I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the public wouldn't even see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then too, with, with like,
with seeds growing from seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard because, uh, you know,
there's not really, nobody really has any
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds that are so true breeding that you
can grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then have it be like a true harvest
batch where you can say, all of these are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be 22%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these are whatever, you know,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, like, uh, like the, uh,
I haven't tested a ton of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like the grape soda skunks,
the ones that we tested there,
[SPEAKER_02]: like in the mid teens on CBD, the THC is
almost not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like turned into almost like a hemp
line, but it's really fucking dank,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and is really close to being at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if, even if you got it to be
there, it's like he said, like the distro,
[SPEAKER_02]: why would the distro want that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, no, we want something with
whatever in the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to sound like relevant with this
little box that we know is definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: marketable, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, it's one of those,
it's one of those weird things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just seeds in general, because of
that, it's like, okay, they're all a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit different, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like I have a lot of things,
but they're always in the low 20% THC or
[SPEAKER_02]: they're always in the mid 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you can do them,
but it doesn't really like, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still, it's still hard to translate
to the market if it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's why, like over the last,
uh, however many years, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my hands on, on cookies when it was
like unknown, basically, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I didn't even really, I was like,
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is what these dudes in San
Francisco have, and everybody really likes
[SPEAKER_02]: it in that circle and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I started doing stuff with it
because it, there was neat shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminded me of neat old stuff,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so then like over the years I've
tried to do like, I did like the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: with the gelato and all that, just because
you look at how it is and people are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, those were really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you have anything that's like the
stuff that people are talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have, you know, gelato 41?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have blah, blah, blah?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, I mean, you know,
people, you want to give people the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it's turned into,
um, uh, a weird thing where like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like running parallels, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have like all the stuff that I
really, really want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of that really actually is shit
that has that stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have cookie and gelato work that I
really, really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you're like,
you have to have these things that people
[SPEAKER_02]: know, okay, I can get my new clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new flavor where when I go to do
it, I can have something where people are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go, okay, I can, this is
something that is actually can go on the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything's been like put into such a
small, such a small box now that you kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of have to go with the flow to an extent,
you know, like you can't just,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, no, I'm just going to go gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody on like, no, they're not going
to want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been, they've been talking about
like doing some, like, uh, making some
[SPEAKER_00]: laws or some amendments to what's going on
where you could have some like farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: markets and you could do direct sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's really what it would kind of
take in order to get a bunch of variety
[SPEAKER_00]: out there is because, you know,
I mean, you guys both know, like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: used to go to like a, um, you know,
a high times cop or a Emerald cop or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, it was kind of like a
weed swap meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could crack open people's jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be some like furry dudes with from
some place, some random spot up North and
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a bunch of big jars, this big of
all kinds of weed and you could crack and
[SPEAKER_00]: you could smell it and you could check it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way that they have it now,
where it's like, you can't see most weed
[SPEAKER_00]: in a store and you can't smell most weed
in a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have like a method for
people to bring new things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like it, there has to be something
more than just like a couple of people
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to hype something right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And drive hype, you know, because there's
a lot of good weed out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking about it a minute ago,
but almost all my favorite weed and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean by favorite weed in terms of like the
weed that gets me the highest it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all between 18 and 25% in THC,
you know, so most of this 30% club I find
[SPEAKER_00]: to be very bland and boring weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something lost there when it
gets above a certain quotient,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or people are breeding for
numbers because people 20 years ago or
[SPEAKER_00]: longer people bred by like, if you're
breeding high, the high is an invisible
[SPEAKER_00]: trait, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a lot of times people,
things would get famous because they
[SPEAKER_00]: worked, you know, not always like he was
talking about the flow, like it barely,
[SPEAKER_00]: it tasted great and it looked cool,
but it barely got you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like a lot of weed got popular because
it worked well, you know, and now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of about the name and the look and
the THC percentage and the numbers and not
[SPEAKER_00]: really much about like, how does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's a lot of unique
highs and a lot of different aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: probably in various people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, well, how do I get it to
the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do I, you know, how do I get
the, how do I get the public to shine on
[SPEAKER_00]: me for a minute and want everything that I
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and then nurseries,
nurseries just want to sell as many clones
[SPEAKER_00]: as they can do as many legal farms as they
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're picking the 10 or 15 most
popular cuts that they think they can sell
[SPEAKER_00]: the most stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's on their menu this
spring right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go and you can look at all these
nurseries and these nurseries have
[SPEAKER_00]: decided, what do I think I can sell the
most of this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I think is a safe bet to mom up X
number of moms of each one of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can sell it on the legal market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they probably, they probably have like
a fuck ton of cool strains that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not selling to people, but they have them,
but they're just, they just don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, they don't think there's going
to be, I can't afford to have a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: moms of that because I don't know if I'll
be able to sell enough cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's all unfortunate because it
all makes sense because you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, what, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like whatever you're farming, if you're
farming, if you're farming tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people don't want like this kind
of tomato, then why the fuck are you going
[SPEAKER_02]: to farm that kind of tomato?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're the nursery selling plants
to grow something, then why are you gonna,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you know everybody's going to buy
granny Smith apples and you're fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: have a nursery that sells apple trees,
like you're not just going to go,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I got a million of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are going to be like,
cool, but like, where's those ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, well, but I have
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, well, fucking,
you know, it's like Joe Dirt's fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: snakes and sparklers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got to have this ship and
people, people want like, it's a,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just this loop that just gets,
it just gets stuck in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate, but it's like,
it's just, I don't, it's how, it's how
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is, is laid out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of it has to do like with
what you're saying, it would be nice if
[SPEAKER_02]: you could go, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like there's a system of, okay,
everybody can get free samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody can look at a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody can feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody can roll it up and see what they
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens is it's like somebody
goes in, they go, I mean, it's in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what's the number?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one has the big number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now people too say like,
Oh, look at the terpene test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't look at the THC test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, high terpenes don't
mean shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles only has like 1.6% or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even, it's just tons of lentil
oil, which is fucking amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's like all those things
that are like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them that are high are really
good, but it's not that the numbers never
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then even if you know that everybody
else says it's really good, you might
[SPEAKER_02]: still smoke it and be like, Oh,
a lot of people could think that blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream is the greatest weed ever because
people love it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people could think that blue
dream is the worst weed ever because so
[SPEAKER_02]: many people hate it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only way to know if you really
like blue dream or you hate it is to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people will be like, it's like
fucking cilantro, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are like, that tastes like
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are like, that tastes like
heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you gotta be able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take blue dream and there's some stuff
like blue dream or green crack or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, or Barry white in our area that gets
blown out and it gets a bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you grow like a four to six ounce
plant or you know, or a half pound plant
[SPEAKER_00]: of that thing and you keep it kind of
small and you treat it right, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a bad rep because there's some
dudes that are pumping out eight to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: pound blue dreams that are kind of big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get B grade and they get treated B
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's all this weed and it's
like, Oh, blue dream sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, that, that,
that version of it does suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you took that strain and you grew
six ounces of it in a 10 gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in your side plot, it would come
out fire and it would probably be a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll even grew, I grew blue dream and I
didn't, I got it late, but it was still
[SPEAKER_02]: big, big ass plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like that's what's crazy about blue
dream was like I tossed in one out of like
[SPEAKER_02]: a, like a four gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like an actual bucket that my buddy gave
me that was a spare plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put it in really late, like as a
replacement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still think I got like five pounds
of weed off of it and it's big,
[SPEAKER_02]: huge, but pretty big plant, good size
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you wouldn't have thought it had
that much weed on it, but dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: the weed was all really fucking killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've always grown, like I always have
the 25 plants and I, um, I was able to
[SPEAKER_02]: always have like really big plants that
were growing were just the same fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: weed as I, as I had like anywhere else,
but I didn't have fucking 350 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had like little gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are big plants, but very,
you know, taking care of and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, keeping track of what,
um, I think a lot of people who had really
[SPEAKER_02]: big plants and who had a ton of them,
it's like harvest is October 4th.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cutting this shit down or,
you know, like these different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get these like real vague growing
styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I'd be like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The North side of this plant is really
fucking done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go ahead and cut like this
section of this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it looks like the stuff that's on
the very top is pretty close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I cut that and then it'd be like,
Oh, the South side is not quite,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, big plants are a whole trip
because it's like a whole garden on one
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So South side finish way later,
like sometimes like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 days later, two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stuff on the backside is like
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go through and you harvest your
whole garden at once, you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now we have the backside is fucking,
you know, 14 days too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the front side is premature and the
middle is great, but fucking those tops
[SPEAKER_02]: probably should have come down because
they're kind of fucking fucked off up
[SPEAKER_02]: there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people's stuff just winds up being
like this, this, this, this vague handling
[SPEAKER_02]: method that it's not specific enough,
you know, but, um, but like, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect to him and I have talked about this
years ago where like, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that can maintain their quality as
they get bigger and bigger and bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain their resonance and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is this ratio of like,
and in general, like the, there's a range
[SPEAKER_00]: where the plant's going to give you better
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's smaller, it's not in all cases,
but in a lot of cases, and if you get it
[SPEAKER_00]: too big, it puts so much energy into like
the stems and the structure and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: building scaffolding around it and it
becomes a huge pain in the ass to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: and the stem on the base is like this
fucking big and you're worried about it
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking and you're like, like gluing it
when it splits because you're worried
[SPEAKER_00]: about rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's just a lot of things that
like make it like harder, like he was just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying harder to like harvest it in the
perfect window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to ride this beast
until it gets to somewhat done and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start taking some of it down and you don't
lose it to the million different things
[SPEAKER_00]: that can fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get 99 of those, that's really
fucking hard to like really keep up with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just go ahead and take the same
clone and do a big garden of seven gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: pots and your plants are just these little
plants and let's like, Oh, every bud is
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every plant is totally even.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is no front side.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no backside.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're too small for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get like, if you really want good
weed, like it is a lot easier to do it in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in small pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even beds, but you can do it in bed,
but just moderate size plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, we grew giants in Mendo
because, you know, there used to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plant counts were pretty
intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you got over a hundred plants,
a hundred plants, the feds could get you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then, you know, Mendo was
like, okay, you know, like we'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll give you 25, 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't really fuck with you too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can have your 25 in your
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so people are like, well,
how do I get 250 pounds off 25 plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get 200 pounds off 20 plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you start developing these methods
based on like the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dream, blue dream, you know,
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Oh, I'm going to grow green
crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where green crack or
blue dream or Barry white get bad names
[SPEAKER_00]: because people are like, Oh, I can get
this clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll give me this much weed on a
reliable basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can put 25 of them in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's too much B grade blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, blue dream sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, no, there's just a lot of
commercial B grade blue dream on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends who like really love
certain types of weed and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can give them the best blue dream
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can grow it themselves or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that turf profile, they just fucking
hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people hate turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people hate turkey turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people hate perp sweet turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't like Chem D turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't like GMO turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some, some shit's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nobody likes the same things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody doesn't like blue cheese and
everybody doesn't like vinaigrette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people are like, no,
dude, like some people ranch on
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people think ranch is fucking
disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like when you have weed, there's these
profiles of these smells and stuff where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you know, some people love to
wear really heavy cologne.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think they smell great when they come
in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me, when someone walks in a room with
whatever heavy cologne it is, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably 99% of the time, I'm going to be
like, fuck, come on, dude, why are you
[SPEAKER_02]: wearing something that smells so good?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just, there's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it comes down to, to,
to preference, you know, like some people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like really powerful weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like really mellow weed,
even if they've smoked a shit ton of weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like one thing we can all agree
on is that everyone loves root beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while there's 331 fucking people in
here right now, Gene, let everybody know
[SPEAKER_03]: where they can get your seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there's a little bit of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the, um, the, uh, I have a little
bit of stuff at alpine seed group.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, speakeasy speakeasy has some stuff
sometimes, uh, LLF has some stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's basically the only people
who I know who have anything really,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, what are you working on right
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you stoked about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like right this second that you have in
your shit and you're like, fuck,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for people to see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe, maybe we should ask him this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you planted, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I see you with green, like little
greenhouse houses full of seed starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're obviously excited about some
things because you're planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would be, this has got to be my
last thing that I talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, I thought I figured the vibe was
going to, I figured lives are about an
[SPEAKER_02]: hour, but we've managed to push into the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this, uh, it's, it's a disaster in
there and I'm in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, um, basically, uh, I have,
I have right now going a bunch of things
[SPEAKER_02]: that are like promising that either I have
like people are testing out for me and I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to like, get a, get a hands-on idea
of like, okay, how do they smoke so that I
[SPEAKER_02]: can line up what their feedback is with
what I really think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or there's things that I think might be
super intersex prone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to see a little bit of
them to see like, or are these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it just, are they, is it intersex
everywhere in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so they don't even plant more of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I think that they might be real
problematic or I already know that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit, but I want to have an idea of
what a few of them look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like 18 little starts going of
those types, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which isn't very, but it's enough to
either or to confirm what's already been
[SPEAKER_02]: done with other numbers elsewhere,
or even maybe that I have seen a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other ones, I have a tray of
36 each so that I can really see what
[SPEAKER_02]: does, you know, what does it look like
when you have basically three packs worth
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it's a home run on that,
and I'm like, Holy shit, every plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: great in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Statistically, we're looking at something
that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look through those and there's
nothing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's not anything good in three
packs of seeds, then I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have other shit that I can focus on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically right now a big test run
where I have about 50 things going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Sensi star cross Sensi star cross
Jaro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bunch of cookie lines,
animal West F fours, which are gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like little dinosaurs,
little rhinoceros looking plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have some of my OG lines,
like not so, not so saw kind of the same
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but trying some of them more
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have a bunch of lime crosses I made
with the F five lime males, a pair of
[SPEAKER_02]: males that I really liked out of a bunch
of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have cherry West cross lime,
two different lines of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, uh, what else do I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like Kim D lime, um,
few other cool things that I got,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like some cool cuts that I got from
skunk tech that are bomb that I hit with
[SPEAKER_02]: that lime I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do I have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, friend place exactly as I,
if I kind of go walk myself down the rows,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like Sensi star back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being paged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, go down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the cookie stuff, the cherry West.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's other stuff that I'm not
saying there's some different Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like yes, go OG, OG Jaro, um,
PK caught cross sky Cutler, double Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know a whole bunch of
different stuff, but they're all that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do a post in a while that has like
stuff up and, uh, and maybe a list of what
[SPEAKER_02]: all those different things are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it's like 1,250 plants,
basically 50 to 18 of some 36 of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and, uh, you know, like I said,
that was my logic was like, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I think maybe they're really
problematic, like animal cookies back
[SPEAKER_02]: cross to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not all herm, I'm like,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try, try, try 36 of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see what's in those, you know,
or try 50 of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like some pure limes,
uh, lime one cross lime F five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm one bread to F five put back on the
original.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I have like a targeted mother,
a targeted males that are put back on the
[SPEAKER_02]: more open mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that's a combination where this is
already a predictable mom, but now I have
[SPEAKER_02]: a real predictable male set that I put
back on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, you know, uh, lime one back
cross two and shit like that, just a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of different stuff to look through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and, uh, you know, the pink
champagne root beer and, uh, pink
[SPEAKER_02]: champagne line, pink champagne,
pina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the pink champagne is not like the
original.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bag seed clone that I got from
these dudes and it's super killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really nice plant, but that's
what's going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go, uh, burn some beef and,
um, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure to check out speakeasy seed bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they've got some of our gear and jeans
gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, check out breederscindigit.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our patron up where you can come
interact with us all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shoot the shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some fights going tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, check out the Northern lights drop
with me and you can get it from me or you
[SPEAKER_03]: can get them from, um, inspector over at
Humboldt CSI.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, five drops out and slamming
fucking slamming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's up, go get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's breeder's packs available and
what else we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: We will have Caleb on, uh, talking about
the NL stuff very soon.
