[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_01]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_01]: Notzodon, Breeder and Grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already done a review on this product
right when I got it, and I did it like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 15 minutes after having it out of
the box and really not knowing what I had
[SPEAKER_01]: as a product and not knowing what parts
did what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was trying something new,
but it really sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to redo this, reshoot this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I actually understand the
product now, I've cleaned it, taken it
[SPEAKER_01]: apart, used it a bunch on different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to give it a proper review.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this product is called... Now,
this part is going to be new to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to get this in shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flour mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the packaging for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there's the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually there is a... If I can get
the light not to... This is just terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: with this light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I could turn down the lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just stops that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't really help much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there's a QR code for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the flour mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it comes, as it arrives,
it's what it comes with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the premium flour mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Flour Mill USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could hurt someone with this thing if
you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get it, you open it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a... It doesn't have teeth on it
like we are accustomed to seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from like this edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a bit different looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inside, you'll see there's a kind of
perforated thingy and you can unscrew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you bought the upgraded screen
package, you can actually change the size
[SPEAKER_01]: of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to show you what each size
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this right here... Now, a lot of
people laughed at me because the last one
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what the hell is this green
thing in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And sorry, I have to slam it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sits in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is so when you go to clean it,
it's a rotor key key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just twist it and bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes all the way off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can easily put it in alcohol,
clean it, do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually pretty freaking handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though I don't know where to put the key
in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're using it, there's not a
good storage place for the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to put it in the bottom
face up so that your bud just hangs in all
[SPEAKER_01]: these crevices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't found a good place to put it
other than in the package and then going
[SPEAKER_01]: and hunting it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I need to use it to clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, what I'm going to show you
first is we're going to start with the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen that it comes with, because most
people, if you don't order the premium
[SPEAKER_01]: flour mill and you don't order the extra
screens, I want to show you what you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is it stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm going to be shredding today
is Santa Cruz Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown by my buddy pack from Santa Cruz
Goat Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I'm going to do that for all the
screen sizes, the same stuff from the same
[SPEAKER_01]: person so that you get an idea for the
same type of blood, but in density and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when I load these, I'm just being
real picky about stems just because I am,
[SPEAKER_01]: though, like the owner said, because he
wrote me after the first the first review
[SPEAKER_01]: and was like, hey, here's my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my number.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever need to talk real friendly,
nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said before, this isn't a
sponsored video.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not paying me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get this for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I saw it at our can Illuminati
party and I was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm big worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I saw it in action.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool and it worked really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I got home, I wanted to check it
out on more stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really get to use a whole
another person's grinder for a whole long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, let's see if I can get
a good picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll put a little bit more in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Cruz Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wish this had like a better macro
setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I want to show you how fine it
grinds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, unlike grinders where you push real
hard and grind, I am noticing you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily have to do that like slower is
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm doing it, I'll do it from this
angle, maybe because it'll just drop out
[SPEAKER_01]: the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just do it real slow because you're
just milling the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not grinding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're milling and you're gently pushing
it against that screen and rubbing it up
[SPEAKER_01]: against that screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it gives the butter a
real super fluffy texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me and I can't prove it like
like what do I know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems to me like it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not murdering the oils as much,
but maybe I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one keeps coming unscrewed ever since
the last time I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, see we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still stuff left up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this screen and this is this isn't my
favorite screen to use, to be honest with
[SPEAKER_01]: you, because I've had a lot of stuff like
this, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sticks are supposed to stay up
here, but like normal, this isn't the most
[SPEAKER_01]: this isn't like cookies density buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that it just compressed it all
kind of is not a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll break it up some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncompress it and remill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't this is not my favorite screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like the the one slightly
finer does a better job.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I can't go back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only go one way right now,
because for whatever reason, this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unscrewing as I go back and forth,
maybe you're only supposed to go one
[SPEAKER_01]: direction, though, because it's like I
kept seeing ignorant stuff like that last
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just needed a little bit of fluffing by
me, my fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the finished product,
and this is what I mostly want you to see
[SPEAKER_01]: up close.
Is the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how it's kind of when you touch
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still very marshmallowy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being this will squish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will rise back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's from the the the screen
that comes with it and granted,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, I did I did a crappy job
trying to grind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a little bit left on top and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So put this somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will do the next screen size
so I can show you if you did get the other
[SPEAKER_01]: screens, which you can expect from those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily with this, changing the
screens is very, very, very easy.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we don't mix it up so you can
actually see the different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Densities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the screen we were using.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's basically a screw on the back
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hold it, twist it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unscrew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the next size down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so now you just load it back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thing that kept coming
unscrewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I would go both directions,
but I haven't had that problem before,
[SPEAKER_01]: so maybe I'm just I am very, very slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any complications, please blame on me,
not the product, because really I've had
[SPEAKER_01]: no problems with this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pretty freaking nice, I will say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the price point on this,
but it is a plus 100 price point for just
[SPEAKER_01]: the the mill without the additional
screens alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to be something that
you're going to like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, get super cheap or it's it's a
newer type tech for this market,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I don't even think there's knockoffs or
anything like that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know, but the quality of
this is pretty sound and like the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm nobody and the owner reached out
and was like real cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it wasn't the best review.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the next size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the next size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller than the screens and there's one
slightly smaller than that, and I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: too larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see the the top of this thing is
magnetic and and weighted too,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn little bit on top, not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frickin not so dog blowing me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ring her off, not so we're busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, here's the finished for this size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if with this camera,
if it really will be able to show you any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll be able to tell any
difference, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the last size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, get clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The texture slightly different with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little less fluffy, little more
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other stuff's a little more fluffy and
this is just a little more fine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you don't have as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't ever have as much stuff left
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we're going to go to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, what will be two sizes up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And after doing all this, like a
barbarian, I'm putting them all together
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slow alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next size up or two sizes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for comparison's sake, we're going to
jump up to this size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was what we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This size up, so we will just use this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go up to that size,
so you guys can see what that one's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The monster size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I did before, I just unscrew it
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screw on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to show it in camera,
even though I keep pulling it off,
[SPEAKER_01]: because like whenever I'm always trying to
find like a tutorial and they can take it
[SPEAKER_01]: off camera like the part one part I'm
looking for on how to do or undo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks and that constantly happens with
almost everything I look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do that to anyone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do message me and let me know and I
will go back and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain it somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that is frustrating as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, one last round of blue dream
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially one thing that you might
notice is that if you buy the premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screens or if you buy the premium mill and
you buy the additional screens,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to happen is you're going to
end up with two of the same size screens,
[SPEAKER_01]: because in that four screen set,
it's an extra screen of one that it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I thought it would be like
additional screens as far as like
[SPEAKER_01]: additional sizes, so then I would have
five, but realistically, like you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to find one that you work with best,
and it's not necessarily going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that it comes with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I saw in the reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people agree with me that that
small one is not the small list,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the next to smallest is.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one that they like to so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one does not come with the mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is only with the additional set.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be cool if they'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe what they should do is like let you
choose which one you get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to just giving you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe give you the choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a good option.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you're not spending extra money
just to get the one that most people like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody likes that kind of
business, and I don't think that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: they seem like good business people,
so hopefully that suggestion helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff this one full because it's a big in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got most of the sticks out I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know this thing does in the
last video I said that it's you never have
[SPEAKER_01]: to clean it because I'm an idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why I thought that no one
ever told me that it doesn't say that
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere, but you do have to clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also like I cleaned it super fast,
super, super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes apart super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cleans super fast because it's not like
trying to get between a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really easy scrubbing with the
brush and bam, you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So props on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was a main point in biting
this grinder was ease of use, and I really
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of was sold on the fluffy texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I kind of love that like that
fluffy texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was like what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look like this is ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know for people who like joints to
this is perfect, but I smoke bowls and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's prime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good for ripping and like vaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't know what ripping is,
but yeah, vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, and here's the final one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if it will adjust ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra fluff watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eats alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's really cool though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of money though at this day and
age like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We people don't have any expendable money
like we used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, there was a collapse in
this industry, so at the price point of
[SPEAKER_01]: like 150 bucks for a grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many people actually buy
this right like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being realistic like that's a lot,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know any other grinders that offer
the same thing at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this moment, like if you want really
nice fluffy, juicy, tasty weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a great option and.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the website is flour mill USA
.com and on Instagram or flour mill USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I don't know if it has a
lifetime guarantee and you go look back,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if it did, I'd be even more stoked
because that would make it definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: worth it if you didn't have to buy another
grinder or something went wrong with the
grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one and they replace stuff that would
be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying they do, so don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying if they did, that would be
cool because I know other places do that
[SPEAKER_01]: for similar price points and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a.
