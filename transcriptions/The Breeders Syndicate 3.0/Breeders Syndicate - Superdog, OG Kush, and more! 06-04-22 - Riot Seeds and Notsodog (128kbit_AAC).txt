[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting for Natsuko to join this
manscaping talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really a master of Pajazzling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
Pajazzling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to Google it, but that's
really not so his main talent is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pajazzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be past your bedtime H&M.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's past Natsuko's too.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in my undies too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost always am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking hate wearing shorts on camera,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I keep it up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it up in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: This region.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always ignores him, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I gotta keep doing him.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal is to make him fucking die
laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Curbside?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the flannel backdrop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't even gotten the new
podcast room up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now just full of fucking boxes after
box after box after box after box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully it'll be up soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Felt lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is he?
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testicle difficulties over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first started the video,
I was like, what if we did a whole live
[SPEAKER_00]: like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the very top of your head and
two eyes popping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just see my fucking wrinkles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard too because I can't really wear
my glasses and focus on something this
[SPEAKER_00]: close, but it makes it hard to read
comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to wear glasses to read the comments
because that's what they're for,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it doesn't really help much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just fucks me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see far and super close at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to join the live, but I think Matt
wanted to get his vajazzling talk out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to let them know about your new
hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted that as a monologue where I
didn't have any chance to object or change
[SPEAKER_00]: the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either technical difficulties or
intentional on Matt's part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just telling about your new hobby
where you put your gems and you just get
[SPEAKER_02]: nice adhesive and stick it real hard and
take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that can make a living doing
that, I've got to make a living somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably paid Marky Mark a lot to
pose on those Calvin Klein's, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would imagine so.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not packing heat like I am,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was an unripe avocado
involved or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for artistic impressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so what do we want to cover
today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought about putting out a few
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were requesting certain stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pay attention to comments if we can
and we'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people were asking about,
because it's a big name, what some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: super dog, which I'm kind of tied into,
story is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what some of the Kush story is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably won't get massively in depth
in some kind of step by step because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of, I don't know,
what would you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of toes to step on.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people with money tied to their
story about Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some legends and there's competing
tales and there's stories that you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have to choose who to believe again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the more complicated ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about how it impacted
California, which is kind of really where
[SPEAKER_00]: it got famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, wow, that's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did know Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been missing for a super long time
and his family still pays like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things that someone
asked weeks ago to do some missing person
[SPEAKER_00]: stories or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have families and friends and loved
ones and stuff and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not the coolest thing to
chat about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sensitive nature of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you can get kids and stuff left
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean it's just more like people,
it's like someone goes missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got friends and family that love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any and the reason why
there's a huge reward is they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: closure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff happens up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you catch the obsolete posting
pictures of HLV infected seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't but I was actually
strangely enough that we could talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that for a second because it was probably
two nights ago or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a pretty long chat with CSI and we
were talking about a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's interesting is as
you know, he's got a couple of plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: have gutting that are just really old and
irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps them, but he keeps them in a
totally separate spot and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, one of them is Callio.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this rumor, I don't know if it's a
rumor, but there's tales going around that
[SPEAKER_00]: the viroid, dudding viroid, whatever the
fuck you call it, HPLV or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only does it stay alive in plants but
it passes on to a certain percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the number is, from the hops
people, it was 8% of seeds it can be
[SPEAKER_02]: passed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people don't understand is that
doesn't necessarily mean that 8% of your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds that you pop are going to absolutely
show it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it gives it 8% chance and it could
be 8% of the seeds you didn't pop that you
[SPEAKER_02]: had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, chances is like so over a huge
number of seeds, all things being equal,
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds sit somewhere between 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either male, female or 60-40 over a
large lot on a big average.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've popped 26 seeds, two packs of
mangoes, haze and got three girls.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had the same stuff where you get zero
females, all males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law of averages on a very small amount
is not that great, but I will say the
[SPEAKER_00]: point before I get too distracted is he
grew out some of those hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't find any evidence of it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say true, but I don't know
how proven that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know how proven that 8% is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that just hops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it not necessarily cannabis,
which is a hops relation?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough science on it yet as it
relates to just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one looks cool smoking their vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to hide it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one looks cool smoking a vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting because there's an
aspect that him and I were also chatting
[SPEAKER_00]: about, which is like there was an era
where you didn't really worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: disease or bugs too much.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew was unheard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no dudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this thing where most people
either did their own clones or only
[SPEAKER_00]: supplied their small little tiny group of
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times diseases or issues
or something like that were fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: localized and you never really heard about
them, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the 215 era, when lots of
clubs started selling racks of cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: for profit, a lot of people stopped
running their own veggies, stopped taking
[SPEAKER_00]: care of their own mother stock and their
own clones and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just decided, fuck that power and
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to buy clones for my next
rip from my friend at this shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain companies, so in a way,
it's like those diseases made their way to
[SPEAKER_00]: certain nurseries and clearing houses that
were supplying a lot of clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they spread it all over and they
spread it to thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of different gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it kind of became this thing
where now you see it on IG and all this,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's advertisements for viroid tests
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are taking all kinds of
precautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had buddies that it came in and
ripped through their rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be different strengths and
different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't understand what a viroid
even is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all, everyone in our crew
has at least seen one over time to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to experience what that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we all kind of fucking know it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, there was even a thing where I
was listening to a different, an excerpt
[SPEAKER_00]: from a different podcast and they were
interviewing someone who scientifically
[SPEAKER_00]: studied it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were talking about the different
methods because it's not even a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like little bits of RNA or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, for the most part,
it's like, it's totally fine in 99%
[SPEAKER_00]: isopropyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't kill it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of good friends of ours,
they had some tech at their nurseries
[SPEAKER_00]: where they had the propane canister and
the torch that attaches to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would torch their equipment plant
to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sneaky fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what I saw was root, if you have a
tray of clones and you've taken all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains, some are more
susceptible to catching it by the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: and the water, or it's the fucking razor
blade or whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads pretty fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so then there's an aspect
where it's like, basically what they found
[SPEAKER_00]: is that like, you know, 10 or 15% bleach
for 10 minutes does kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like H2O2, hydrogen peroxide,
the strong shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about the chemical
composition of bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if the Vinoxide works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a few other things that
cause, that kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of those things are like really
harsh on tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but then the interesting thing about
bleach is if you buy like store bleach,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, our buddy Skunk just said Vichrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy like clothing bleach,
like sodium hypochloride, that stuff only
[SPEAKER_00]: stays good once you mix it for like,
I don't know, five to eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it gets too dirty,
it goes inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Jungle Boys, Jungle Boys was
saying they were using, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it wrong, but it was something like
Sanidate or Oxidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like one from that company,
Zerotall or.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, yeah, Zerotall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I spilled that shit pure on my
fucking leg once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sterolins are tough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, for people, now that we've
gone this far into it or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you want to use a bleach solution
that stays a lot more lasting and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get fucked up super fast, like your
laundry bleach, get bleach for pools.
Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's calcium hypochlorite,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And calcium hypochlorite is, you know,
pools are dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they get shit in them and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as far as, you know, dirt and leaves
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't go inert the same way sodium
hypochlorite does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now people, I mean, I go to the store
and I buy, you know, like a hundred pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of blades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just add to, you know, every plant
gets a new blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good habit to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an aspect to it where it's
like, so what sucks is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go somewhere and you see some really
cool tech that somebody's doing and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, I'm going to incorporate that
into my own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you find out that it actually
doesn't work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried with, I tried with the Sanidate
and Oxidate on the four way Trinity cut
[SPEAKER_02]: because both of those have the HLV and no
dice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to wish you a happy pride.
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, before I lose it, cause it'll go off my
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant gets its own rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking all the precautions to actually
like separate and not cross contaminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically like dipping in,
having a separate like thing of Clonox for
[SPEAKER_02]: every fucking thing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, then you're,
then you got to use Rockwool or you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: use the earth plugs or something like an
easy cloner is like that's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're done at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like making out with people with
the flu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, uh, you know, and,
and so it's hard because there's like real
[SPEAKER_00]: science and bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a long time, we only had bro
science because real science couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: touch wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you how long I have heard
that powdery mildew classes passes to
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been bro science for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I first heard about the HLV thing,
I was very skeptical, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'd seen a lot of people breathe
with duds over the years and never seen
[SPEAKER_02]: the duds pop up in C form, but apparently
the hops people do say it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean that, that obviously still has
to be checked and, and proven over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how science is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like, it's the best information you
have and, and you know, we'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that originates from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think stupidity, I think, you know,
powdery mildew one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, well, you know, it, it,
people that have to understand the life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle of things and like a viroid isn't
even a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like little bits of RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to have something so small like
that, be able to just fuck us up so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what translaminar means,
and I probably should, but I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So translaminar, there's two things,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's vascular where it's moving through
your vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's trans laminar,
which is essentially like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some, for, for instance,
like to give you an example, if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: use a certain kind of poison and it would
be a contact killer, or maybe it would
[SPEAKER_00]: form a relationship and be trans laminar
and go on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be systemic though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have systemic vascular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know systemic vascular,
but I never heard, I wouldn't think
[SPEAKER_02]: systemic would be just leaf, leaf
touching, but I guess that makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, I mean, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the people, humans have figured
out all kinds of different shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but he's right in the sense that PM
is, you know, it's like PM, the hardest
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is to break its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's what people don't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they mostly break, break its
life cycle, but then it like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you live in Orlando and
you're surrounded by vineyards and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else and everybody grows,
uh, you know, we got a crash course 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago and PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I wanted to make some equal
20 jokes, but it's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even joke about that shit
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause people take that shit soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said avid is a, uh, avid is we used
to call avid the death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, avid is a trans laminar systemic or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, 20, 25 years ago,
some of that is systemic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I last, I do remember the spider
mites are not susceptible to things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are systemic because of how deep they go
into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the issue, the issue becomes
really with spider mites specifically is
[SPEAKER_00]: that 20, 25, 30 years ago, there was,
there's a bunch of poisons for spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, uh, that are, you know,
all from pretty natural to pretty toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: that worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, people overuse these toxins
over and over and over again, it would dip
[SPEAKER_00]: their clones in it every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just, yeah, they were trying to
take precautions, but what they bred was
[SPEAKER_00]: supermites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty sure avid wasn't systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the ones that's not,
um, just because it's not, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: systemic doesn't work necessarily with
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't go that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe people aren't, there's,
there's vascular systemic and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: trans laminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, when you think about it,
like if something's a contact killer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it means that the bug has to come into
contact to killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's something that's trans laminar
and like, and, uh, um, and, and persists
[SPEAKER_00]: within the leaf for a period of time,
it'll kill the bug for that length of time
[SPEAKER_00]: that it persists.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not necessarily systemic,
if it stays in the plant, that's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it's also one of those
things though, that it's systemic in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that, uh, your plant will test
positive for it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's something specific
about it not being systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what it, what it actually is avid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I mean, so I'm a chloropid,
which is the people use for root aphids or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff you can test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that stuff will test dirty one to two
years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of maybe, I mean,
maybe I'm getting it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I consider to be systemic is that if
you apply it and then weeks or months
[SPEAKER_00]: later, you can still test for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around it's in the plant system
somehow, whether that's the leaf system or
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, you know, and maybe we can look
at it up and maybe I'm totally fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always possible, but that's kind of
how I, that's kind of how I viewed things
[SPEAKER_00]: is like things that persist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't, I have no clue to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember that the, the,
the old saying that systemic stuff doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: work on mites cause they don't go deep
enough into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just asked if you spray avid and
veg, it will absolutely, um, it will
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely persist for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there used to be, I should say,
I should say this thing, there used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing where not to call anybody out
or anything like that, but there was a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that supplied clubs that knew
exactly how many weeks you had to go not
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying it to test totally clean at the
club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would do this thing where like
this gentleman just, just ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you spray it and veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would spray the shit and veg and veg
for X amount of weeks and then bloom for X
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of weeks and then know that it
would be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in order to, in order to get
around that, uh, the legal testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it went from PPM to PPB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: From parts per million to parts per
billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it went to parts per billion,
it fucked every, all those people's math
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the rates, they were using it and
everybody was hiding, using it and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and so now what's happened
is, is that a lot of these mites have
[SPEAKER_00]: survived decades of people spraying them
with all kinds of funky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are a lot, there are a lot
stronger and there are a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant in California than your average
might would be in the wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit in San Diego back in the day,
dude, they would drink out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd take a shot and say, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like they were, they're brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's a, it's,
it's not, you know, and then everything
[SPEAKER_00]: gets overused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like anything else, if you don't
actually eliminate the problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you just knock the problem down to low
levels and you keep doing that over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again, eventually the ones
that survive are going to be better at
[SPEAKER_00]: resisting whatever you're using.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be totally organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be evil, like, uh, avid or forbid
or contos or, you know, those aren't evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like being sued.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, uh, just in the sense of,
you know, I mean, everything has its
[SPEAKER_00]: place, I suppose, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I don't want to be, but well,
you know, I mean, all that stuff comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the only reason why in that shit
exists is because it's all over your
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking food.
Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it doesn't exist for weed
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those, all those crazy chemicals and
stuff, Eagle 20 and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all exists because it gets used all the
time in commercial food production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you could even buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back in the day, the big mix in
my roll of crudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't even admit this, but it was,
it was a long time ago before,
[SPEAKER_02]: before, you know, a lot of the information
was available, even though you could smell
[SPEAKER_02]: it and you could smell the toxicity,
but it was a phyton 27 and spectrocyte
[SPEAKER_02]: immunox mix for some reason seemed to just
knock PM out, but it would also murder
[SPEAKER_02]: your fucking plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immunox is kind of like a derivative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like another brand name for Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, uh, yeah, the Eagle 20 gets
sprayed for grapes, uh, avid.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these things are designed for
ornamentals too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, you know, points set like
the, like the fucking PGR bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where everybody, you know, for a while,
where if you were super unethical and you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get two or three pounds of light
and you didn't care about quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would PGR your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it had, it had a bunch of
names, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phospholode or, uh, you know, there was,
there was a number of companies that would
[SPEAKER_00]: all hide what it actually was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same shit that makes like,
when you walk into a grocery store around
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas and all the points set is the
same fucking height to the inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because they got treated with a
PGR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think, I think the term PGR has
been demonized just like, uh, GMO or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are great PGRs and I see
people saying, fuck PGRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you don't even know what you're
talking about because there are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: PGRs that we all use that are decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that, uh, a lot of the
companies would hide the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking, uh, what was on the label.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually they, they got caught
onto and they all got pulled off the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, sunlight supply came out with
one that they called Dr. Nodes and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: fully vetted through all the, all the
various agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, uh, my, my buddy had a shop and they
got all these samples and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: samples was this bottle of Dr. Nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at it and it was a bottle
and it came in its own plastic sheet that
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of like almost like a medicine
thing that you had to rip open and do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of its warnings was pregnant women
should not touch the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty heavy, but like on the
same, on the same tip, uh, a natural PGR
[SPEAKER_00]: is kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You apply too strong a kelp, you'll plan
to do some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right in the sense that it's
just a term that exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, but what most, what most people are
thinking of when they think of PGRs and
[SPEAKER_00]: weed is like possible load and like the
name is this long and it's methyl ethyl
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has a bunch of parentheses and
hyphens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's all, it's all kinds of
bad shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pack low pack, pack low butanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and in addition to, in addition to,
um, making your weed super dense,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it fucked with your crystal content
and made your weed a B grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of companies and this is
even fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you weren't evil, uh, and use the
shit, sorry if you used it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just called you evil, but they didn't
put it on the label and lots of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other companies that
would put it into like blood blasters and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would just put small amounts for
that extra oomph.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all part of that fucking nutrient
game, which I mean, after making the
[SPEAKER_02]: spray, um, and, and learning about
different nutrients, how they're sold,
[SPEAKER_02]: how you get regulated, how you get,
you know, Omri listed, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, to me, like, it was like
learning about the, the, um, vitamin,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, like, uh, what do they call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you go to those muscle stores or
whatever, you can buy all their
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements, supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to, I have to interject too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, someone's couples,
a couple of people said, uh, gravity and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like that, which is definitely one of
the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone was like, yes,
it was, it's illegal to not have
[SPEAKER_00]: everything on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be shocked to know that people
make making products for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were willing to do something
illegal and that not all of them had the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest of ethical standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they got that purple max though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that gravity shit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, I had a friend, uh, who literally
was like an early proponent of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you'd probably call it living
soil today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super anal about inputs and all
this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he comes in and he buys some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and all it says on the label is kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had the full Paclo in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he goes out there and he makes a
whole resi and he waters all his beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's, he'd had those beds for like five,
six years and had been developing them
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he went and sprayed him with
Paclo cause it wasn't on the, it wasn't on
[SPEAKER_00]: the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought it was killed and nobody knew
to tell him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, um, yeah, that some of that
stuff was insidious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to sell you a product
that you'd buy again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and it's just like, I look at it
like drug dealers who press their pills
[SPEAKER_02]: and like, you know, double the strength of
their Xanax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course people are going to go back to
that fucking dude if they want to get all
[SPEAKER_02]: super fucked up and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was even, there's even pesticides
that have gotten caught, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That have gotten pulled from the shelves
in California, uh, because they listed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, clove oil and this and that,
whatever to kill bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they test it and it's got avid,
it's got Abimactin in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got, it's got low amounts of
something that really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then they just figure,
um, is someone actually going to analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: my secret sauce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, eventually people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a, there's, there's been
times where like, uh, weights and measures
[SPEAKER_00]: has come into grow stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by law, you know, if it says it's 40
ounces, it better be 40 ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says it's X amount of pounds,
it better be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll pull all their shit off the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it doesn't weigh right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are asking about power.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that's a, um, orthosilic or
monosilicic, um, acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's still
like, basically what it is, is it's silica
[SPEAKER_00]: in a form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot more absorbable for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of silica out there that is
not that easily plant absorbable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bioavailable for cannabis unless
you reuse your soil for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so as a result, uh,
there's, there's a number of cutting edge
[SPEAKER_00]: has one, um, power C is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of them that put it
basically in a different, in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of a better way to put it,
uh, that makes it, uh, that makes silica
[SPEAKER_00]: acid that makes it a little bit easier for
the roots and the plant to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the few products like that,
that I really actually visually can see
[SPEAKER_02]: change within 24 hours of using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive as fuck, but yeah,
people are talking about, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzyme products on the market right now
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, enzyme, enzyme products are,
uh, um, I use them a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually there's Newcomb and, and Dr.
Zimes and all these, and they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: basically this, this, they're enzymes that
fuck with the, the eco skeleton of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, of the bug and there's citric acid
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really gentle and a lot of
more organic and they test clean and they
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely annihilate, uh, powdery mildew
and they do a pretty good job killing
[SPEAKER_00]: mites too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still, I'm still a big proponent now
because of you, of the, um, what's that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit called?
[SPEAKER_02]: The micro sulfur, micronized sulfur,
micronized sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, micronized sulfur, if you don't
use oils and you spray micronized sulfur,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll never, uh, you'll never have russet
mites, uh, or PM in your veg ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except when I use them both together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the same bottle, like a
absolute fool and every plant that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, yeah, they'll burn hairs though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'll definitely, uh,
sulfur is a really, uh, distinctive aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: and you definitely don't want to be using
sulfur for any reason much past the first
[SPEAKER_00]: week of flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start, uh, it's, it's not a good
idea, but in, in veg, when it's just all
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks and stems, you know, and leaves
it's organic, it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, uh, it, uh, it,
it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I totally got away from oils simply
because I like sulfur in the rotation as a
[SPEAKER_00]: safety measure in the veg and plants tend
to like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, so I don't use oils at all
because I, God help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got russets or something like that,
um, you know, it'll, it'll annihilate
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's safe to use indoor,
but I don't like put on masks when I spray
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the fuck do I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is safe to use indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I put, I would put on masks,
you know, there's a lot of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote, that's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that I might only put on like,
uh, uh, like a, uh, snowboarding shell or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to spray, but I have a full face
mask with a visor and the whole bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it might be safe for your plants,
but that doesn't mean your lungs want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't want to breathe in wettable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to breathe in anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on that level, you know, so I always
wear a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to my eyes either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably why I'm fucking blind to be
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, you know, it, uh, it,
I just, I, you know, did I always do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I got older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I've gotten older.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried to, to be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a real nice, I don't know,
it's a two or $300 full face mask or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even for the most basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it on someone said they started
using sulfur because that guy who said
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfur is how to get our gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it'll definitely make your weed
smell and taste like a tire fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you use it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feed it, uh, to the roots,
it does, you know, increase terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it has, it's not going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said, yeah, newcom, newcom and
sulfur or newcom and Dr. Zimes and sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them back to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not oil in there, so you could use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing, something happens when you
combine oil and sulfur, it re it changes
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH on the plant and it burns them to
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It murders them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've so do you, uh, sulfur is,
sulfur is very, uh, very, very safe as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you don't mix it with oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never usually do lines of, um,
pure or wait, I should say if it's over 90
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, sulfur can really hurt your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, don't, if, you know, uh,
we meet me, uh, our buddy and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, uh, one of the fires in 2019,
I think it was 2018, maybe, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had sprayed sulfur the night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next day, one of the biggest
fires in California history started a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of Hills over from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing it did was burn out a
bunch of power poles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 108 degrees and the lighting
went out, but sort of the air conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the fans and everything we had,
cause the power poles bent and fell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it got real hot and we lost a
bunch of moms, um, to sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the day four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, I mean, there was a lot of
things that sucked about that fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, I mean, we didn't have power at
that spot for almost two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it was June and you have a
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there was problems,
there was issues, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, but yeah, I mean, uh, people,
uh, trying to read and talk or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't even think we actually
bullshitted for on a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get, don't get sulfur on your
lights, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, sulfur, sulfur works better
than anything I've ever seen against
[SPEAKER_00]: Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely annihilates them and it
annihilates powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had Russet mites in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I should knock on wood somewhere,
but powdery mildew, you know, it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's even a problem in Bakersfield where
it's super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, do you know that, do you know
that they consider, uh, Russet mites
[SPEAKER_00]: areoplankton?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever heard that word areoplankton?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So area, so obviously plankton in the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get carried around by the
currents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russets are so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get just carried by wind currents
for long distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, that's why they call them
areoplankton because it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: living things that are just getting
carried along by current, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: wind current.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have a neighbor, a couple of
hills over and the wind could be going the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could definitely start blowing
off their plants and right up the hill and
[SPEAKER_00]: right up into your ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how a lot of people got them in
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually was they spread neighbor to
neighbor, farm to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be, you'd be downwind from someone
and about July, August, their garden would
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could take all the precautions
in the world about quarantine and bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: in clean stuff and not allowing pests in,
you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they came in on the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't that a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody just said, uh, spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's, there's, uh,
I'm sure there is, spinosad is a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: story actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've ever heard it,
but spinosad is like, uh, uh, is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically a bug killing, uh,
fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they discovered it in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was an old, uh, rum mill and
they went into this big old factory,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, rum factory and they noticed
there was no bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like zero, no spiders,
no bugs of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took soil samples and they found
spinosad A and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's what, that's what,
when you buy spinosad, that's what,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from them discovering this thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the reason why you shouldn't
fucking use it is that it is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is terrible for us bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of the most toxic things for
bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's safe for you and it's safe for
people and animals and all that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, but it'll take out a whole beehive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's not, it's not, uh,
you know, I mean, I guess if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, you could safely use it on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you really wouldn't have too much
risk or be, or, you know, be an asshole
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, if you're going to spray it on a
bunch of your, um, your depths or your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors or something like that,
you'll put, you might kill the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: bees all in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might just take them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have their own, they have,
they have enough struggles going on right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, bee populations with a lot of things
that are fucking with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I would definitely I could never
in, in good conscience recommend somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: use it in their depth or their outside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it also wanted to hear some
shit on OG when we can get to that sucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, we just took it in, we just took
it in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you know, there's a bunch of
people listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if we talked about certain things
and, and why not to use them, that's cool
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's the reason when people say
Oklahoma or California, there's testing
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harmful to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because bees pollinate half of our
food sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really, really don't want them
to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are dying at a rapid rate and
they're dying at a rapid rate from a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different issues and from a bunch of
exposure to toxins and pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides and other, and other stresses
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally there's an immense amount of
stuff that you eat that wouldn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated if it wasn't for bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though spraying a shit ton of bee killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it was a little rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, all right, so we can, we can talk,
we can talk about Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this already just, I just totally
changed my mind and don't want to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, but yeah, but I mean,
it, it, there could be, there could be now
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've been chatting about it for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, not right now, but like our
experiences in the future or people want
[SPEAKER_00]: to know about, uh, pesticide or,
or tech or how to beat certain things or
[SPEAKER_00]: what works or what doesn't, um,
living up here surrounded by growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've kind of seen about just about
everything tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start to poke around and what
works and what doesn't, what, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: downsides to this thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause most things have downsides,
you know, so you got to pick which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: you're okay with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people want to hear about OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of things or like a lot of
famous stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not mine or Matt's story.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have nothing to do with OG by any
means, you know, but we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we thought like, so there's,
there's like the most mysterious part
[SPEAKER_00]: about it is the, is the Florida history,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts getting a little bit more
definitive and understood once it got to
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we thought is like, obviously this
is like, I mean, there's been whole shows
[SPEAKER_00]: where people confidently talk about the
origins of OG and this and that and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of stories because
it's so famous of various people trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: lay claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's somebody in Hawaii who says his
dad did it, you know, uh, that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite was, was, was the underground
bunker Frank Gigaak story that Frank
[SPEAKER_02]: Gigaak said is not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my personal favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's, there's the,
like, there's a story that it's Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: work that got sent to Hawaii, uh,
and made his way to Florida from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville did have apparently many backups
everywhere that we don't know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, you know, there's a story,
like you just said that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank is a guy that had a bunch of,
uh, basically undergrounds and warehouses
[SPEAKER_00]: and big grows, uh, in the Southwest,
uh, you know, uh, United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Arizona, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona and New Mexico-ish and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, there's rumor that it came from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it certainly seems guaranteed to have
come from Florida people coming out this
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Fatty did meet, uh, old Dave
Richards.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was there when I met that guy and he
was, he had a circle around him telling
[SPEAKER_02]: the tales of OG and how he fucking made
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I've met, uh, I've met,
uh, Dave Richards.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you meet him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he smokes black and miles on one of
those fucking things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked him in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, I'm not even gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's a funny dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's, he's personable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's personable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard not to like him, but when I
realized how much he was lying to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, okay, come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was so easy to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's personable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a, there's an aspect where
Mark's castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there's, basically what it boils
down to is that Kush became one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things that ended up being so famous and
made so many people money that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people invested in trying to be
like, you should give me rep because my
[SPEAKER_00]: crew or my family or my whatever,
my friends are the ones that brought this
[SPEAKER_00]: to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people come out of the woodwork,
you know, I mean, uh, and I'm not trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to call individuals out, but it's like
there's everything from those crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: stories we told you to the one that Matt
and I tend to believe, which there was
[SPEAKER_00]: like an accident in a closet and it came
out of some bag seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, uh, ever changing story from TK
origins, uh, with different years and
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants and different
certainties, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, it's also possible too,
that like it's, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it went, it was, it was strained by a
different name and now we just know it is
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, we, we, you know,
Neville told, uh, Neville told Matt that
[SPEAKER_00]: he thought that most of the American Kush
stuff was based off his Kush for NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was all just,
it was all just phenos of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just thought it was NL2 expression out
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought this is NL2.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and then, you know,
there's, so there's all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but regardless of all that,
uh, you know, um, yeah, someone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, there's, uh, there's a bunch
of rumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we don't know any of the
parents, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows basically anyone to step in and
say, fucking, this is the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I also think because the way
OG expresses being long and lanky with
[SPEAKER_02]: dense nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like what we would consider
traditionally as like a sativa because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so long and lanky, but then it has
these dense nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And resin, like an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really easy to just make up
bullshit and be like, Oh, that's a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: Nepalese and just some random sativa and
some random Afghani.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll go way the fuck back for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start, start at the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very beginning of Kush in America,
and we have no idea if this relates to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush that everyone is familiar with,
but people would bring back seed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindu Kush mountain region of Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those mountain valleys had the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first term Sam skunk man
had a Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Hindu Kush mountain region.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hindu Kush mountain region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the Indian supposedly gave Seattle
Greg a Kush that got put into NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, there's various ones,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it used to be a generalized term
for a region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where now, if you fast forward 40 years
today, it basically goes back to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, the Kush that went to LA,
the TK, that type of thing is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what everyone thinks of is Kush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went from like a region and all
these different Afghans within that
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a very specific, you know,
expression and look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now if you talk about Kush today,
you're not talking about the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore with anyone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're specifically talking about a
specific phenotypic expression and a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's variance within that look,
but it's got some key characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one second, just for everyone that
keeps mentioning the packy lemon tie,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell the actual story behind how
that, how that came to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll laugh your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so anyway, so it started off as a,
it started off as a region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we should talk about the region
for just a second, cause it might interest
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I have this theory and I've,
and I've seen it in some different places
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and we've bounced it around and
I would, so I wouldn't say it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: theory that's like, you know, you couldn't
poke holes in, but I think it can hold
[SPEAKER_00]: generally true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if you look at Afghanistan,
there is parts of Afghanistan that are
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere from sea level all the way up to
10,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different elevations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Mazar, that region, that's maybe
only 800 feet above sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's areas on the Hindu Kush
valleys that are five, six, 7,000 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: where they grow vegetables and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what tends to be is that when you
get the low land Afghans that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: foothills or the plains or sea level in
Pakistan or Afghanistan, they tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the squat bigger, like fluffier plants
with much wider leaves, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing in more humid areas,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're lower to the ground and they
have these big fat wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get up into these high
mountain regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which also has Afghans and those Afghans
kind of sound a lot like what Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: described with the Kush that everyone's
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guinea leaves, but Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not big fat wide leaves, but skinny
leaves, golf ball type, much tighter type
[SPEAKER_00]: nugs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think about the environment that
they're in, very cold, colder,
[SPEAKER_00]: drier, a lot more UV, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the leaves are smaller because
catching all that UV is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intensity is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think what I was talking about
this with CSI because I don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of experience with outdoor other than if
you, you know, like the depth runs in San
[SPEAKER_02]: Diego, but I noticed that even with the
NL5s, they're expressing way more narrow
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a trait that outdoors
because of humidity and other things and
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiration, they're just naturally more
narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's going to have a range of
expressions based on all kinds of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Homely just said,
you know, UV protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher up you go in elevation,
the less atmosphere there is, the less UV
[SPEAKER_00]: is filtered out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously, even though the plant
might come from Afghanistan, if it
[SPEAKER_00]: developed in a valley that's six or 7,000
feet above sea level and it's a mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: region, that kind of cold and day night
temperatures and a lot of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to have different breeding
pressures and different plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus a lowland plant from the plane that
gets, you know, moisture off the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a different kind of
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of misconception
where people think all thin leaf is sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: and the broader and fatter it is,
the more indica it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have narrow leaf, pure indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just happens to, it's just
usually highland weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not lowland weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think that's a big
misconception for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a major misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all indica and all Afghan, the broader,
the broader is the more Afghan and the
[SPEAKER_00]: narrower is the more sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and maybe if you crossed a broad
leaf Afghan to a narrow leaf sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be true in the children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so now, so, so anyway,
so there's highland Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, there's a lot of
mountain valley weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot, there was a bunch of
weed coming over to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Called Hindu Kush, because that was the
big mountain range and all the valleys
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dirty old saga saying there's hash
plants because those were all hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those Afghans.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Lebanese, my red lead that I had was
also narrow leaf, but it grew like a big
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghan sideways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was real fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's just, you know,
like a lot of times and it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you read books and you see what
you're familiar with in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certain assumptions that get
made, but they're not always the true
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, and, and,
you know, narrow and, and what I mean by
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow leaf is just like, obviously
there's a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodie has a lot of really good narrow leaf
Afghanis and Pakistanis put out if people
[SPEAKER_02]: are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just, and so a lot of times I,
I believe very strongly, I can't say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred percent fact, but I believe very
strongly that almost all those narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica types developed in high altitude
regions of those mountain ranges where
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't need as much leaf to capture
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed less of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because each leaf has a job, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there at transpire water and it's
there to catch sunlight batteries and
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it, if it on my buddy, I was visiting
my friend yesterday and he was showing me
[SPEAKER_00]: an Afghan and it was thin leafed and
fluffy as hell.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the leaf has a job and if
it's way up there in the mountain valleys
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can do its job on a skinny leaf,
then it's not going to put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: effort into growing a big fat thick leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a narrow leaf Indica type or
hybrid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ercol expresses many different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it be narrow and I've seen it be
broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of those that it depends on the
room, the environment, how, how narrow or
[SPEAKER_02]: broad it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as a general thing, a lot of times
people, you know, people judge narrow or
[SPEAKER_00]: wide based on and, and make guesses based
on how sativa or how Indica, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly think Mac can tell the
story about the Paki and the Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly think some of the, some of the,
the Kush that we're familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of its narrow leaf characteristics
led people to believe there was sativa in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think the stretchiness and all
that shit and definitely it wasn't as
[SPEAKER_02]: broad as a lot of Afghans despite the
density, but the story originated from,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were two brothers back in the day
that went by brothel brothers and one
[SPEAKER_02]: would call himself Kailua kid and the
other called himself NYC kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both I think are still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know NYC kid is still, but back then
Kailua kid who also went later on to start
[SPEAKER_02]: Trichome Kings and a few other things and
paradise seeds mod was another name of
[SPEAKER_02]: his.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made the claim that he bred OG and that
it was packaging a standing crossed a
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon tie was a Dutch flower string.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, there are ties that are
lemony, but the one he was referring to
[SPEAKER_02]: was a Dutch flower strain and he's not in
fucking OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, isn't this, that's one of the oldest
stories that's been shot down more than
[SPEAKER_02]: almost any OG Kush origin story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to this day, to this day, people still
fucking repeat that shit ad nauseam
[SPEAKER_02]: because they don't know that the guy was a
major scammer that started the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's fucked all of us, all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he made a lot of claims about
Asian fantasy and all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_02]: stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just what he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I remember at one point he was selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He called dog, dog, but ass ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I kind of called him out on his
like, well, fuck, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got him in a, in a bag labeled dog,
doggy, doggy, but weed, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: close enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the guy that they're relying on
for that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the, the second story that we were
talking about, the Frank gig app story,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was started by a guy named Dave
Richard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he told the story on Adam done.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came out and he actually, I believe
Adam done at one of the Adam done cups
[SPEAKER_02]: gave him a lifetime achievement award for
breeding and bringing OG Kush to the
[SPEAKER_02]: masses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unfortunately, Dave Richards made a
lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first ones was that it was a,
it was a hash plant Thai Afghani,
[SPEAKER_02]: which he kept referring to as HTAF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now HTAF is an old term from DJ short
referring to Highland Thai Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was confabulating different stuff to
make his story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also said that Frank Gigax left a book
behind, um, with the breeding tips on OG
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and everything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I spoke to Frank Gigax directly and
his daughter, I went to lunch with his
[SPEAKER_02]: daughter and breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went into a few different things,
but, um, I talked to Frank Gigax over the
[SPEAKER_02]: phone and he said that he wrote that book
as a grow book for dummies in prison
[SPEAKER_02]: because he had nothing else to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dave's store and also Frank Gigax said
they never bred there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only commercial production and it
was, he gave a few different lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was like NL four,
something weird that I don't think you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably had, um, big bud, skunk one and
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said we did no breeding there
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he completely smashed that story to
smithereens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but still people again, repeat it
constantly to this day as truth because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was aired once on a show, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but those are the probably two of the
biggest ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third being, uh, the creepy story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, I, I don't think anybody
that's been around a long time even gives
[SPEAKER_02]: that dude any kind of credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even worth addressing,
to be honest with you on the creepy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what, you know, and then there's,
there's, there's the story of how,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was accidental
pollinations in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so really what a, what it seems
like it does seem to me at least is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do believe that there was multiple people
that brought Kush from Florida to
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's factual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we're, you know,
because obviously people know about
[SPEAKER_00]: cornbread Ricky and TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent that out before he came out
physically himself to the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people know about, uh, uh,
Matt Bubba and, uh, and, uh, Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, Josh D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say, I'll say flat out.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, when I first talked to Matt,
I thought he was full of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he comes off like a little bit of a
used car salesman.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you talk to him, he's very friendly,
but it's his, it's like his nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't believe him, but everything
that I ever researched and found is he has
[SPEAKER_02]: not been wrong once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as much as I was biased against
him, I've told him, dude, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't poke holes in your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, like I don't believe you,
but I can't poke holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm left with a truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so there's an aspect where,
and Bubba, Bubba, and that Kush that went
[SPEAKER_00]: to LA became very famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: TK became very famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a strain that got sent to the
Bay, uh, that we called the Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that I've chatted about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I posted about, um, that went into
cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so what we don't know for sure,
uh, uh, Irene, Irene comes a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: later, but that's another beautiful Kush
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there are, there were multiple
people that got Kush to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: To different people at different years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know the slow down real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think, I think people would be
interested in the Irene story a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so, so Irene, I'll let you tell it
because, uh, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the original Irene is, is as best I can
remember, I wish rude boy was here right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, but, um, the original Irene was
picked from a bag of weed that went from
[SPEAKER_02]: California to Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was kind of cool was that we were
able to link up resin lung and his crew
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Atlanta crew and how they were
shipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we said it a few times,
but you can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they shifted a certain way and it
was so unique that when they were both
[SPEAKER_02]: telling the story, it was like,
holy fuck, there's no way they just made
[SPEAKER_02]: that one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that nobody would think
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was originally from a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to say either the first Irene
was from a bag of Larry OG or the second
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene that they picked after they lost the
first Irene.
[SPEAKER_02]: They picked another selection that was the
most similar to the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that came out of Larry OG,
if I remember correctly, but that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: rough story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Irene that we have now is what you
would consider Irene too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one almost everyone has
grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a few people like smoke to herb and
rude boy, uh, really experienced the first
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so there's, so basically if you
move past the, uh, the, the origin
[SPEAKER_00]: stories, right of who's responsible for it
or where it came from, uh, of which there
[SPEAKER_00]: are many, uh, um, there was, it does seem
like the stuff that we know of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, made its way from Florida to
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know exactly if all those
things were the same cuts or there was
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple cuts that came out or there is
possibility that there's a cut that shared
[SPEAKER_00]: a name and was called different things by
different crews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are totally possible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, what really happened is,
you know, uh, uh, Bubba Kush, Matt Bubba,
[SPEAKER_00]: he brought, he, him and Josh D brought out
Bubba and that, and a couple other strains
[SPEAKER_00]: from Florida to, uh, uh, a neighborhood
out in LA, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they started growing some rooms
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened, I think in LA is that
LA is such a, is such a hype town and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, it's so about flash and it's
so about, like who has what, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol or cars or watches or clothes or
whatever that Kush caught on with a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain clientele and then everybody had
to have it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so demand went through the roof
and you know, there was only so much of it
[SPEAKER_00]: being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so wholesale became crazy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so it became worth a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what was, what was, uh,
you know, what, what was it going for back
[SPEAKER_00]: then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 7,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six to eight K, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and, and it gave you status if you
had it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just became this craze in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the beginning there wasn't very
many, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nature of LA, we've talked about
this before with seed companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the nature of LA, uh, to everybody to
pop up with their own shit, nobody down
[SPEAKER_00]: there wanted to give anybody else credit
for how they got theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bullshit and the, and the stories
started happening immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the Bubba, just so everybody
knows the Bubba that, that Matt Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out, it died by 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bubba that everybody has now is not
the first Bubba that came to, came out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily Bubba is, is such a specific type
and breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably is something similar,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, they found the, I believe the
story is it might even be somebody like
[SPEAKER_00]: rascal or somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone found someone tied in found bag
seed in original Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Shaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, uh, they, well, I think the thing
is, is that, and I think that's why it got
[SPEAKER_00]: named Bubba Kush because they thought Kush
pollinated the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Matt Bubba's story, if I remember
correctly, and I, he, he can correct me on
[SPEAKER_02]: this, is that Bubba is a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubba Kush is a hybrid of Bubba N-O-G.
[SPEAKER_00]: N-O-G Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original, so the original Bubba
that came out is no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has, everybody, regardless of
how you want to believe the story,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to Matt, who brought it out,
they lost the first plant that they called
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bubba Kush is a hybrid of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to get really confusing within five
or 10 years of this plant hitting LA,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a whole family of what you call
Pure Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Malibu Pure Kush, Topanga Canyon Pure
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only knew of one Pure Kush in Southern
California and it was called Pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't LA Pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't fucking, there was no Hollywood,
no Malibu, none of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No Malibu, no Topanga, no Suge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Pure Kush and it was a lanky
ass OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was OG and then there was
Kush and then there was OG Kush and then
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden there's a Valley Cut,
there's the SFV, there's a Larry,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a this, there's a that,
there's a blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden the names start
proliferating, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the point where, I don't know,
by, you know, 05, 06, 07, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably most the clubs and it was so
popular that probably most of what clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: sold in Los Angeles was Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was probably 20 or 30 different
Kushes on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really don't know how many
original things these things started from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have a buddy that came to one
of our Can Illuminati parties,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was telling the story about how he
had bought a couple of pounds of Kush for
[SPEAKER_00]: 8,000 bucks.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought it home and he starts
breaking up the weed and a couple of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's looking at two seeds from an
$8,000 pound that nobody can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he spent the next two days looking
at every bud per seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became, I think, the poison OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cost us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he bought two pounds for 16,000
bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, dude, I'm just rolling my first
joint at home and I hear a seed hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: table and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at this seed and I'm like,
I just spent eight grand a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonder if there's more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if the weed looks like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every every seed, you know,
and we have a good buddy who got the Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: in 99, we think, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 99 somewhere between 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's tied into some of the first people
outside of outside of Matt and Josh D that
[SPEAKER_00]: got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the and one of the people
intimately involved in running it very
[SPEAKER_00]: early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we heard a lot of a lot of tales
from him about sort of like how it spread
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it started and what it was like
and the politics and the clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times clubs would name something
because they wanted to be the only club
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Louis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the only club with the this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has this funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell it like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a great accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could never tell anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some there was some Armenian
that, you know, he would always joke about
[SPEAKER_00]: and like he would be like, let me try your
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would be like two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he wanted for one rooted snip
of his OG that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so, you know,
it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine paying eight thousand dollars
a pound and you find it seeded to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just meant he was going to be able to
grow some of those seeds and grow his own
[SPEAKER_00]: eight thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was excited as all fucking get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was stoked because that gave
him away where it's like before it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like there was you think about the demand
of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and how many people live in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much wealth there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there's only a few garages or a
few rooms of these things cracking,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes fucking lickety split.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's way more demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so changed weed from then on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe we should maybe we should
take a step back from the story because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's lots of people that like
to talk specifics about the origins and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're tied into it and all that
fucking bullshit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever specific cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened is, is because that weed
was worth so much money and because it
[SPEAKER_00]: became so popular in this area that had
like twenty five million humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and is sort of like a pop culture
like, you know, melting pot, for lack of a
[SPEAKER_00]: better term.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ship blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, all these
different names popped up and everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to have their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what that also started doing was
because brokers could make more money off
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started pushing all these people 800
miles away in Mendocino and Humboldt and
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow weed that they could make more
money off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't want, I mean, you know,
like my buddy who gave me the Flow Rider,
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't do it out of generosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did it because I was giving him the
Superdog and the dog and the Maui and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Skunk and different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had this Kush that he could make
way better margin on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like, give me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't tell me he was going to make way
more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know that that was the rake
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it did is it pushed a lot of
people to start growing similar stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purple, the purple craze that we
talked about before with Caleb and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that sort of started like the do you
have this clone only and you better have
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have this specific clone only,
I'll buy all your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, it's going to be less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, maybe I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kush was another wave just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could sell every gram of Kush you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so brokers started going around and
started trying to giving their,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like who would fucking ghost,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was people that sold cuts of Kush
for 30 to 50,000, 100,000, $200,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were paying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they could, then they could fill
rooms with it and it was like an
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was violence over Kush, which is how
the, you know, I mean, I don't really,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't really like to tell that story
too much, but it does seem like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I call the 56 day headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started out named, named something else in
the Kush crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some stress and some
violence and some whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fled the, they fled to the Bay
and they wanted to call it something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't get in trouble for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they chose the name headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, you know, there's a
lot of people that, oh, well, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what cut, we should talk about this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I firmly believe that the cut that Josh
brought to LA first with Matt,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really hard to figure out the
lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like what's actually in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of people that think when
they get ghost, that that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of people that think when
they get 92 OG, that that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of people that think when
they pop Josh D OG seeds, that it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: but forget about that one for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying some people think SFV,
some people think Josh, some people think
[SPEAKER_00]: ghost, some people think 92, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone mentioned that earlier again,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And our buddy said he doesn't think any of
those are it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened in LA is everybody came
up with all these different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even like there's one SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few that float around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not just one Tahoe, not one Larry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you consider is like SFV is it,
there might have been one time when,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it was called it, but a lot of what's
currently circulated right now is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the people that bought ghost
off ghosts, like 20 years ago for high
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar, they don't think the ghost cut is
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what they got 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the guy that goes around is ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that people talk about is not the same
ghost that had the cut and traded with
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon kid for Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people confuse this Kelly guy with
the original guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of the ghost cut right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't the first ghost cut and what
everybody knows is ghost grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't the first ghost that passed the
ghost cut who now lives in the Midwest
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if ghost grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same one is the one that was going
around calling himself Kelly Cush farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't the Michigan ghost,
the Michigan ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to one of his buddies and he
asked to be put back in touch with Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the first time I realized that
the ghost that was kind of hanging around
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon kid, wasn't the same ghost that
passed the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put him back in touch, but I don't
know what happened from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people are, people are ripping through
the stories or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because the first people that,
the first people that brought it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes with certain strains,
you lose chain of custody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there was an issue where
freaking, uh, you know, uh, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh will get too mad if I say this,
but like Josh lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cut in an accident and none of
his friends in LA wanted to give it back
[SPEAKER_00]: to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had to go to a friend in the Bay
that he had stashed it with to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typical weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people were like, Oh, it didn't
even matter that he was the guy that they
[SPEAKER_00]: got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a lot of these original guys that had
it, they lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and there's an aspect where it's
like, and I don't mean, I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that like people have fake ghosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is, is that there's four
or five cuts out there that all claim to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the cut that Matt and Josh brought to
LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those cuts, if you grow them side by
side, they're not the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't, and I don't mean like not
the same cut that they first brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not the same cut to each other in
the same room at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then how do you know, how do you know
what, you know, and nobody called it 92,
[SPEAKER_00]: 92.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that's a more recent adaptation to
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a more recent adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first name, there was no going back to
like when it was first around for a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of years, no one called it 92.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we don't, people don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the 92 Hollywood Hills cut
is the same as the flow rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it could the flow rider
be the exact same cut that Josh brought
[SPEAKER_00]: out to California, to LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got that one early,
but I didn't get the Josh cut early and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get it with provenance that I would
know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people keep asking about the Shug
Knight and the Kushmore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That story is a bag of worms that no one
wants to touch because nobody has any
[SPEAKER_02]: facts really around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's rumors going around that
they might have some relation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one, the one that you think would came
first might not be the one that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: is the first one between the two.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, so there's a lot,
there's basically, I bet there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that have different named OGs
out there that are the same OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one guy's, one guy's Larry could be
another guy's SFB could be another guy's
[SPEAKER_00]: ghost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these names became
interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start adding names and then
you start getting Lou Louis and fire and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Diablo and, and, and da da da da
da.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's all the pure Kush names and
all those riffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the master Kush's and two
or three of the master Kush's look like
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba Kush's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them that I used to have was
tall and lanky and dark and very stringy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think two dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think two dog has the fucking
SoCal master.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I see it, it looks exactly like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell's angels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people say that vibe,
you know, that, yeah, you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could probably name and there was
probably a 10 year period where like you
[SPEAKER_00]: could walk into a club and they would have
20, 25 different names on the menu of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, some, some collectors out here were
only OGs and that was their shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we only carry OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a fucking list of like 40
different OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's funny is that, you know,
that fucking dude ghost grow or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: he rages because there's people in LA that
their entire careers just been learning
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grow Kush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And selling it for high dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had such a long successful popular
run before things changed that some
[SPEAKER_00]: people's entire careers have just been
cropping Kush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but there's no, like there's,
so there's this aspect where, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most famous families of weed
out there, there's a bunch of origin
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and there's a bunch of claims and
probably most of the cuts that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: LA are bad seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would think, and then sometimes that's
what I always thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes a different crew would
get it and they'd throw a different name
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just renames and bag seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I mean, I like Josh or
whatever, but Josh did the stupid fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where he took, he took like,
uh, what H A O G and something else and
[SPEAKER_00]: something and crossed it all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we never heard, when was the first
time you even heard the word 92?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you even hear the term 92 OG the first
10 years you heard about OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really hear that until like four
or five years ago, the 92 attachment that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now people are like, Oh,
well, is this, this should be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 92.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one that started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like one of the more recent OG
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how did the Louie get started?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the fire get started?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the, this get started?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's hard to find these stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people don't have an interest in
honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they were trying to do is sell a
different Kush for a high dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature farm has all those old something
and they aren't dotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you know, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got KNF cures duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen his movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen his movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got everything you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he doesn't do any like negative
testing or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, he just knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just got the sense, you know,
um, but yeah, fire OG is rascal SFV or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe fire OG to somebody else is
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire OG is a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it came out of a tray of clones and it
was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which specific OG it was,
but, and I don't think he was told
[SPEAKER_02]: anything more than OG and it was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he called it fire OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on, um, swerve made a cross
of fire OG and something else if I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember correctly and called it rascal
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's one of those things that one
of the biggest things about OG is that OG
[SPEAKER_00]: OG and sour, but especially OG art is
probably one of the first strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: like it just dominated breeding and
hybrids for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and what's interesting is like
for a long time, maybe we should talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about this for a second, but for a long
time, um, people would work OGs and they
[SPEAKER_00]: would breed with OGs and they would S one
them and kind of the best pheno would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that looked like mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you wouldn't find a bunch of
shit and the good ones would be the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that look exactly like the parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Caleb, uh, reversed the TK and he
got a much wider variety of cool phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found ghost in there and he found,
he found ones that looked like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: popular ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's like one of those ways
for a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a breeder to know that you have
like, uh, you have a mother type situation
[SPEAKER_02]: of a bunch of other cuts is when you S one
it, and you're seeing all those sister and
[SPEAKER_02]: brother phenos popping out of what you
just made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you kind of get the idea
that triangle might be the predecessor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's interesting because if,
if, you know, if there was bag seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was multiple cush strains found in
that bag seed, then the initial bag seed
[SPEAKER_00]: would probably be a hybrid maybe.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you know, it seems like there's,
there's at least one, maybe a few cush is
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that throw much wider phenos
than most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it almost leads it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost leads you to believe that a lot
of these cush is our lucky bag seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: people found and named, but because it's
an S one of cush already, it kind of looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like itself for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's one of the, it's one of the
reasons why Caleb and I believe that the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog, the 91 itself might be an S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it throws such a narrow band of
phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a bunch of, there's a bunch
of physically, it doesn't look very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, potency wise, it can bury quite a bit
in some flavors, but there's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow band of physical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of cush are like that probably
because they're bag seed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's also interesting too,
that like, um, you know, I mean the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the two of the most famous strains out
there, um, the cushion, the sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: neither one of them reverse very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of failure with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times, a lot of times things
get reversed onto them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, that's usually how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only, the only real OGs I'm seeing
people like regularly reverse or OG
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids and they, they have to get lucky
and find something that'll reverse well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of these old OG cuts be it,
you know, backseat to backseats and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: finding that like S twos, S threes,
shit like that doesn't reverse well for
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to reverse like a
multiple self or multiple backseat
[SPEAKER_02]: generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes sense for OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense for a lot of these OGs,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, yeah, they, they,
they ended up getting out-crossed and then
[SPEAKER_00]: people would, would, would reverse some of
them looking for better shit and the best
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that they would find was the shit
that looked like the shit they already
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got kind of over OG because while I
think it is an amazing strain and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: here trying to diss it or anything like
that, I don't think that it's genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: expression is wide enough that you would
need to keep 20 different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, this one's earthy,
this one's lemony, this one has a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: hint of this, this one's more tennis
balls, this one's darker, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone wants you to S one the hog's
breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't, I haven't run it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it started getting past, I dropped
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody asked an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does S two and S three and all that
get harder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what happens is, is you're
selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only one set of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every time you self, you increase
the propensity of recessive traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: are negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the deeper you go into selfing,
the more narrower you're putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when issues start happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's rules against anything
for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to bang your sister or
your first cousin or your mom or your
[SPEAKER_00]: uncle or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you from personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that shit sucks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it took out the whole royal
families of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed some out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept selfing essentially almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then, you know, as things
get, as things get more narrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times S three, S four,
it starts getting a lot weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts getting a lot more prone to lack
of vigor, stress, other aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of regular breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of regular breeding that
uses selfing successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: In agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: In normal agriculture, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selfing is a massively used technique with
great success.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, it seems to have negative
connotations taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people have a different idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, at least, what it seems like
selfing, the biggest thing is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is because most of the things that we have
are individual cuts and not seed lines
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to see what else is in the
genetics besides that one expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you had, you know,
a hundred seeds of what OG Kush came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of, and it was males and females,
you'd have a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a cut, then how do you,
how do you see what it is pure and not
[SPEAKER_00]: out-crossed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times, I mean, Caleb talks all
the time, like if people are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency in seed, then the way to go is
some of his out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of the feminized hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of the feminized hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for specific phenos,
but you're willing to tolerate more junk,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the S1s are going to have a certain
amount of recessive stuff in there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: undesirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it bred with itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the out-crosses, you know, Urkel
reversed onto Kush will be more consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: than Urkel onto Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why, again, why, like when I talk
about the blue bonnet and despite what was
[SPEAKER_02]: said about it, that it was a pure
blueberry line, I still think to this day
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's a hybrid because all those
recessive traits that blueberry usually
[SPEAKER_02]: carries when you further integrate it are
gone, completely erased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked before about how I didn't
like the pure blue lines very much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you out-cross them to different
other amazing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those kids came out way better than
the parent, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was massive inbreeding
going on in such a small environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: the constant crossing of two distinctly
different expressions, like crossing
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica to Sativa or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't breed like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They breed in this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't keep constantly
in-crossing two different types through
[SPEAKER_02]: generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that caused some weird inbreeding to
go on and not all the best traits to be
[SPEAKER_02]: apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ is really unusual, dude, because if you
believe him, what he says, he basically
[SPEAKER_00]: took four plants and never added anything
else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything that he has comes from
those four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a Oregon purple tie and a
juicy fruit tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe something else or that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oregon purple tie was chocolate tie,
Oaxacan gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, yeah, count those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you count those two, it's four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of times, all those things
were only used once, according to him,
[SPEAKER_00]: never back-crossed two again or
reintroduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just worked within the lines.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Kamara has talked about how he kind
of used all of DJ's stuff as this big
[SPEAKER_00]: mangled inbred specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least that's cool because you never
mixed anything else into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything about how he made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent several thousand dollars on those
specific seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to really work to find things
that were good blueberry turps,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that just wasn't what I was seeing
in the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I ran 400 and 450 of four of
his lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I was bragging about keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, like, I wouldn't have loop
on it without those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's great potential in those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, like you said, it's in the
hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of like that thing
with like, you know, the closest thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have to an actual IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: People throw around IBL all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me at nine nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: IBL sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because an IBL is essentially something
that's been bred so consistently that it
[SPEAKER_00]: just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's looking like clones of each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything looks like clones of each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have some kind of ideal where
you're trying to grow fields of exact
[SPEAKER_00]: replicas, it might be a good tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to breed all of the genetic
diversity out of your shit and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that you cross with it is going to look
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that that that 88 G13 hash
plant kind of throws phenos that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross things with a deep chunk and
it's very deep chunkish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Gene did point out that like there
are so I when I refer to IBLs,
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think a deep chunk because visually
it is it is very uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's like two phenos,
like two visually expressive phenos that
[SPEAKER_02]: look distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you smoke it, some have a much
better high than the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that I when I was speaking about it,
I was only speaking visually when when in
[SPEAKER_02]: fact a true IBL would be for all traits
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why it drives Matt and I nuts,
because there are no IBLs in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so an IBL is basically
something that breeds true for all traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the seeds are going to be very
narrow within that tiny little band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a true breeding strain that's
only true breeding for one trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true breeding for blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, you could have you could
have something like skunk one that's true
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for, you know, improving calyx to
leaf ratio or, you know, bud structure or
[SPEAKER_00]: this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a variety of turps or,
you know, things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so true breeding and IBL is like
the furthest example of true breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when all the characteristics are
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And true breeding is just one or more of
the characteristics you can count on
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in the project.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when someone the other day,
I can't recall who it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was I think it was a lady was saying
that that they have an F2 IBL and people
[SPEAKER_02]: are like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that lady was like, no, it makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make sense to have an F2 IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of terms that are
thrown around.
[SPEAKER_00]: IBL is the worst one because you should be
able to buy 100 seeds of an IBL and see
[SPEAKER_00]: less than two percent variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I think what where the
miscommunication is, is that a line being
[SPEAKER_02]: inbred is not the same thing as an inbred
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And line breeding is not the same thing as
an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, IBL so specific and line
breeding and in breeding in a line,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't denote an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a process to getting towards an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's where a lot of
confusion lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's if there's a bunch of variation
of any traits at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your weed, it's not an IBL.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, IBL is basically a way to an
agriculture to grow clones of each other
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you're going to grow an
IBL for weed, it's like you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed all the cool shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be worth breeding with
once it's an IBL for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to have such a narrow
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make everything look like
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully, you know, so if you made
an IBL, maybe it would be just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if it was something that was
just so incredible, but it'd probably be a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd probably be a bunch of work and it
would suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, realistically speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another reason it's very hard to make IBLs
is because males express different than
[SPEAKER_02]: females, even if they are the same
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Males are even if they're the same general
phenotype, they the male always grows
[SPEAKER_02]: taller than the female, so they don't look
identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to choose the male expression of
a female line that you want to find is
[SPEAKER_02]: very fucking hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's much easier and faster
to do it through selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect, too, where someone
was like, well, what if you just picked a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good plant to IBL?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's assuming that all those traits will
be the dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more that you breed, inbreed into
itself, and you're not going to lose them
[SPEAKER_00]: by inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, so so there's an
aspect there where it's like it someone
[SPEAKER_00]: just said, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed whatever the question was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was trying to look for it just
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, Matt, if you can find it or
someone wants to, you know, the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no cubed term.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only motherfucker that ever used the
term cute, like like the C99 really cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a Mr. Sol thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of his his own terminology
for repeated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even after this, you still have these
fucking trading wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's no cubing was just like
he found some bag seed and he started
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding it to itself a bunch,
you know, which was already probably
[SPEAKER_00]: inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not only lock in shitty traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, one of the reasons
why they don't want you to bang your
[SPEAKER_00]: sister is because the shit that happens to
you when you start breeding humans too
[SPEAKER_00]: close is a lot of mental issues,
physical issues, various kinds of things
[SPEAKER_00]: start popping up that in normal humans are
never dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you inbreed enough, you can combine
those two not dominant genes and it'll pop
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said, what about this isn't a real
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about recombinant inbred line like
Tony Green and Gigi for I can't even
[SPEAKER_02]: answer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like without laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's a guy who was
talking shit about Caleb and said he was
[SPEAKER_00]: at like F12 or some fucking there's
there's there's an aspect where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's let's let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's a lot of there's a lot
of terms that get loosely applied to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not that well understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not anybody's fault because it's
not like there's seminars on their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of information gets passed
through friendships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times some of those
friendships like aren't passing the most
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable information about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're hoping that people don't know what
the term means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like they've done work if
they put stupid ass terms at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: F12, like if you really think that some
dude that's been around not that long,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it F12, then you do not understand
breeding or how long it takes to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: through generations and to do real
breeding to make sure that generations
[SPEAKER_02]: correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've made an error to go back to
the previous generation, keep working
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're never going to hit it right
12 times in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So implying that he has worked something
like 12 generations is asinine to people
[SPEAKER_02]: actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's friends of ours that are
breeders that are like, dude, I had this
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did this thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't end up keeping enough seed
from before I did that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get rid of that seed and go one to two
gens back and go in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't keep the seed and I fucked it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as good as it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't make it the way it was before
because I didn't keep that gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically like I'm a misstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a misstep if you don't save
seed from every single rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people say F2, F3, F4,
I mean, what that means is that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to grow a bunch of seed,
pick males and females that exhibit traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want, cross them, and then breed
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a question, and I'm going to
address it just because me and CSI were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about an hour ago, before we
started this, anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is crossing an elite to an elite
breeding or pollen chucking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider regular breeding, like using a
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider that vacation and taking days
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the easiest shit to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make their seeds themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have to shake it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding using reversal techniques is a
lot more involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a lot more errors a lot real
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could take something and
isolate it and make it more true breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can also make huge errors right
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very rarely does a pollination go
where you can just hit something and shake
[SPEAKER_02]: it in a reversal and the seeds make
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just doesn't really happen that
often.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times you have to get in there
with fucking tweezers, tweeze out each
[SPEAKER_02]: one, shake the fucking pollen out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of that shit won't be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just because that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an aspect too, which I should
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason why Matt said you're
not going to do 12 readings that all make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he means by that is that,
let's say you're at F3 and you grow up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of F3s and you're ready to make your
F4s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you realize that you don't like
that combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to go back one generation
earlier and try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you didn't like that selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to get to F12, that means 12
times you would have to grow up seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what you see, pick females and males
of each one, cross them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow up their children, and just keep
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single time, every single Fgen,
you're like, fuck yeah, I won.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fuck yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you're going to get
somewhere and be like, oh, that went in a
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that nearly as much as the
F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: This F5 sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go back to F4 again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a Green Crack BX1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was one of the early growers and
breeders with Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just nice and mango-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really beautiful purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a sucker for purples.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the BX1, I had crossed it to,
and actually I've done a few, but the one
[SPEAKER_02]: that I ran with was the Platinum Banana OG
as the male from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out crossed to that back to the Green
Crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I found was a lot of Platinum
Banana OG plants and not many Green
[SPEAKER_02]: Cracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't expect that, because usually
Green Crack breeds dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was one of those cases where it's
like, OK, even though it's a BX1 and it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like it should be super green
cracky, that's not how it played out in
[SPEAKER_02]: practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only in theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of was an epic fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why breeding is such a bitch,
because you spend all this time and energy
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it, and then you're like,
oh, I don't like that choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the drawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide back down and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of missteps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of things that you hope
will happen, like I'm going to take this
[SPEAKER_00]: and cross it to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping these traits come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, oh, that's a
horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why so many people just like to
make one off out crosses to different
[SPEAKER_00]: things, not test it and just release it
and just move on to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you can spend a bunch of
time dicking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was there's an aspect where
Bodie was telling me when when he first
[SPEAKER_00]: got the 88 G 13 hash plant, right from the
end guy seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't realize that they were already
F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he kept the first he kept males and
females of the first round and didn't lose
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he took it three more gens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got shittier and shittier every
gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he ended up using was the very
first seeds that he popped from the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial seeds that he got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it and that's what's in
all those hybrids that people buy from him
[SPEAKER_00]: is because those those moms and dads made
way better crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than any of the intentional work he did
after because he thought he was getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, oh, open pollinated a couple
of times and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and he spent all this time three
doing going three gens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of time, a lot of effort is
not rewarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like and then he's like
each one of these gens sucks ass and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to stick with this first
shit I have over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have saved myself a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can guarantee you after being in
this business this long that what's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: sad and what a lot of people have noticed
that that are in this business is that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're the how quickly things sell,
how much work you put into it has no
[SPEAKER_02]: reliance on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in the hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no real reward to putting in
all that extra work to then fail and spend
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of money doing it or to then succeed
and still not be able to outsell something
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's being hyped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people when people make comments
about like, I don't see readers doing long
[SPEAKER_02]: work anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason it's just not financially
viable anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as bad as it sucks to hear that,
as bad as it sucks to say it, that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why most readers, if you were
to ask them like, you know, to like people
[SPEAKER_00]: breed and they put in a bunch of crosses
and then they make a bunch of packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not dissing it by any means,
but I'm just saying that they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time to test every round of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't anymore before release.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not it's not it's not
feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can you might look through
the things that you're the most interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in always.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and see and be like,
oh, I really want to see what's in this
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even that is the minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can think of like seven people that do
even that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's an aspect where,
you know, I mean, Matt and I, when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: researching like, I guess you'd call it
last season's podcast that we were doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were doing a bunch of nevel work,
you could go through the Sensi catalog
[SPEAKER_00]: from 91 to 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it barely changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barely at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just little tiny things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barely changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some some names here and there,
one or two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe in five years, they added three
or four things to the catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, it's like people come out with 20
or 25 new strains every crop every time
[SPEAKER_00]: they make make a drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they make another drop six
months later, it's a totally different set
[SPEAKER_00]: of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's become vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: People used to be able to get away with
Simon from Syria seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 20 years, he sold six things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That don't work no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Russian, chronic, AK, Kali Mist,
bubble gum, and one more than one more
[SPEAKER_00]: than I'm forgetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he sold he sold six lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made those six lines over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said AK, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there maybe I think it was six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named five off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was six, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was six.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, 15 years of just making I'm
going to make these same hybrids again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like they didn't have to change
that much since his catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first five or six years was pretty
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last three or four years in
the 90s, they added four or five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it stayed consistent after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like that's not what breeders
or growers or anyone expects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be all new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even with me early on,
I would like to clock the clockwork horns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd always keep that in stock and like the
White Russian big ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I said White Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it kept it in stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the years, you realize that's not
even viable to do anymore because people
[SPEAKER_02]: want new and now and new and now at all
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not everyone, obviously, but the
majority of the seed people buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't do that, you it's not a
viable company anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Matt and I laugh because we read
all this stuff about what people think
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders act most.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders are actually doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus what they actually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, these guys are
testing this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking for herms and they're
looking for this and they're doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're making choices and selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the most profitable way right now
to make seeds is just to like blow off a
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, collect the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's even worse than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the most profitable way to make
seeds like compound and guys like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: they buy seeds from other people already
made and label them something they're
[SPEAKER_02]: hiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of stuff that goes on with
like people would be shocked to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how many how many of their like
some of their favorite Cali people got
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds made in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, or have some dude that they know
that has a tent, make seeds and act like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're blowing up their facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of there's a lot of
fakery there, you know, and people eat it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've realized that they with IG and
with these things, they can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: narrative and hype and people never see
behind the screen door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the amount that they think that
they're yeah, most aren't even germ
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most aren't even taking 100 or 200 seeds
and spending two or three days and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure they get a good pop rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what fucks candy rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't pop, you know, and he sold
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold them for like 800 bucks a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 800 bucks a pack or something like
that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but so there's all these things that
they think their breeders are like these
[SPEAKER_00]: mad scientists, like really putting in the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most and that's how they present
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the people that do put in work
and but don't show it that much for
[SPEAKER_00]: various reasons, they get called out for
being the big guys that aren't doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, dude, your hero is like
paying some kids to do the work while
doing the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing photo ops while while ordering half
of it from Dina Femme in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think he's been carefully working
on it for the past 12, 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and he's just putting his name
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally a relabel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and there's not a lot of
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not just and so what Matt was
basically saying is that there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: incentive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for financial survival for most people
to do what the customer base would like
[SPEAKER_00]: them to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it used to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of us would rather just
quit and join the stupid shit parade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, think about how many people out
there can do what our buddies CSI does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is show pictures of rooms regularly
of what was running and show pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that he made that there's 200
phenols growing in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you can go years and years
and years back of he hasn't he hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: popped everything he's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's constantly popping stuff that
he's made and looking through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of dedication is like uber
rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like him and a few other
and you know, few other people and some
[SPEAKER_00]: hobbyists who are doing it for love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the famous people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's just not financially
feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have the space and they
don't really have any goals either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to just make much money off
a seed drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Caleb, Caleb, I can guarantee you
will spend every dime doing it right
[SPEAKER_02]: because he's so OCD and autistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: about how he gets it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's very admirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also his favorite part of the whole
process is seeing what's in the hybrids he
[SPEAKER_00]: makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually the part that keeps him
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of it is kind of a soul drenching
grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that he gets excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never met a man more excited about
genetics and seeds than that man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fucking awesome because he's one
of the him and not so and a few of our
[SPEAKER_02]: other friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the only people that I've ever
met that I can sit there and nerd out with
[SPEAKER_02]: like that and dork out for hours on the
phone and just talk about genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and our wives all hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually have a buddy who just
mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's I have a buddy who's like as old of a
seed weird breeder interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process as you'd ever meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people scattered throughout
Mendo and Humboldt here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never been a majority anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely a weird offer.
Shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to have I want to have Uranus
come on sometime and talk to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I know he's a big fucking nerd
like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He he is, you know, a bunch of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like even fucking Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's people that aren't
comfortable talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: In public as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a hard thing, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do believe, you know, because
you're alive, like in person, just sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: around with a couple of buddies smoking
joints and shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could capture that, it's amazingly
conversational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the party is like even even for me to
sit back and watch everyone like talk
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like like even some of the people
like everybody that was involved with O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush, except for Big Ricky, was it one of
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like everybody but him was
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can listen to all of them talk all
at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people should know the guy that's
famous for Irene Rudeboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he came out with his whole crew
one night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and brought his herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had our you know, we sat around and
we saw we shot the shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and exchanged a bunch of stories and,
you know, confirmed a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so yeah, not so does not
need to grow mustache.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the thing is about mustaches,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is no prejudice whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 46.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in my 20s and 30s, I would say
the only people that had mustaches were
[SPEAKER_00]: like police, firemen and gays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no dudes just now it's back in
style and there's a bunch of like 20
[SPEAKER_00]: somethings or whatever, just rocking
massive 70 stashes and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like it went out of style like
the station wagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looks like he literally looks like
a Tom of Finland character when he has the
[SPEAKER_02]: full stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do Superdog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do Superdog before we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Superdog.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting close to being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will people but we're bugging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will give a brief synopsis of
Superdog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt sent me some stuff that like blew my
head off about Superdog and in some forum
[SPEAKER_00]: posts and stuff like that that we won't
get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But needless to say, I think what happened
is, is that there's a there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: versions and there's a few things that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened over time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy who I never mentioned,
I just call him Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly it's a it's a it's a bunch of
it's a bunch of his story, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, the story starts,
I guess, with he gave the super skunk to
[SPEAKER_00]: chem doc to Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 93 ish, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 94 ish, Greg calls him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's super excited because the super
skunk had permed onto the chem doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got a bunch of seed and he grew
this seed up and he said, this seed is so
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing this stuff instead of the chem
doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was this aspect where get
where my buddy Staten Island thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, maybe we could blend these two things
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't know shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't know shit about STS or reversals
or anything like that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so pre pre that it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, homie 3000 miles away just had
an accident and got some seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so homie out here thought,
oh, maybe I'll have an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he basically started the project and
he took a Hawaiian plant and crossed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the super skunk hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got he got like a super skunk
line for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bred that a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he took he took some males of
that and tossed it on the we tossed it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the super dog was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was helping him a little bit in the
middle of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then him and I worked together on
hunting through a bunch of super dog
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing further outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some stuff on the East Coast
that might have had a similar name that
[SPEAKER_00]: came about in a very different fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but, you know, get the fuck out
of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell I'm going to tell one
real quick story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was obsessed with finding that super
dog cut because I was a big fan of diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: and supposedly they were similar genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was chem 91 super skunk supposedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was supposedly Chem D super skunk
according to the Canter Bible at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had already had diesel and I loved
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the super dog really interests me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't sure if maybe they got it
wrong and it's the same cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remember asking Greg back then chem
dog about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of inferred that he had bred
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw another post today where he
again inferred he bred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that it was the same genetics
as your guys's out in the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's still no pictures,
no provenance, nothing for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I asked for any info about
it, all I get and with diesel as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: all still, all I get is let me check my
notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to do a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like chem dog a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've met his wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's, that's as far as I can
get with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think in my opinion, I think they
didn't know much about super dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: They heard about it and that he may have
taken credit for it back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was probably what was going on with
Gabby and you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we did a bunch of work on it and it
took us and we, and you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of projects like that where
when you don't have some specific goal in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of like timing or anything,
it's like we popped off a rip here and
[SPEAKER_00]: then four months later, six months later,
we did another stage of it over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it's kind of like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it a long while you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up, what happened is what
most people, what most people know of is
[SPEAKER_00]: we started picking phenos like the seven,
the three, the 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pictures of it in the Canna
Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started spreading it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started giving out selected cuttings to
friends and we crossed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time when we did, you know,
we were trying to do, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we basically took out of, out of
hundreds of seeds, we took like our four
[SPEAKER_00]: or five favorite males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Combined with about seven or eight of our
favorite females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put them in a room and we bloomed
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we threw in literally every good
cutting that we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actual chem 91, actual super skunk,
the warlock, my black Dominica,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Maui, uh, the, the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, we didn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before I didn't have a Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I didn't have a Kush quite yet or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but we, so we did basically just
like, it was like bred amongst itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we bred it to like every fire cut
we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, I, uh, uh, that one
totally distracted me, but I, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: I did do that herbalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did do that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, uh, what I call the skunk
spring cam line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only other one besides,
um, the early math, getting line that I
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently can, can make skunky shit
come out of really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, uh, he doesn't
really like to chat in public or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he probably, uh, um, my buddy from
Staten Island is probably should get the
[SPEAKER_00]: most credit for the super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he put the most time into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, him and I did do projects with it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, it was the projects that him and
I were doing together that ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: getting spread out and getting
photographed and getting traded to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of, I think where it
started popping up on the forums and
[SPEAKER_00]: people started talking about it and seeing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a bunch of super dog hybrids to
Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's kind of the basis of the
males that he started with his,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Emerald, Emerald mountain seed company
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that, so it started, it got,
it got mixed into stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other things that are pretty
famous too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we won't go into that right here,
but it was what we were trying to do is we
[SPEAKER_00]: were trying to get the density and the
potency of the camp 91 combined with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the color and the crystal content and the
nose of the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted potency and density from over
here and we wanted a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: looks and frost and turps from over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was killer, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it probably would have,
it probably would have taken off a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: more if the purple and then Kush and
diesel craze hadn't started where everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to grow the exact same strains to
get the dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, yes, the super dog would
have been in, in disposed in 2001 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bay, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that would definitely be an era that,
uh, there would definitely be an era where
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have gotten, uh, a lot of super
dog went to the bay a whole bunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, uh, uh, you know,
I've talked before about how we lost it
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the different things and been
hunting for it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, uh, you know, it exists in a bunch
of children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, skunk and chem seemed to
be a great combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, I know, I know that at least
in 2011 or 12 that Maui super dog was
[SPEAKER_02]: still being grown up North that weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you know, Karnak the
weirdo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's Finos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends from Trinity County that
grew for years and their boss,
[SPEAKER_00]: his favorite strain was a Maui super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Maui super dog hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, some of the Maui super dog,
uh, Mandelbrot wrote about it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he found out of seeds that I gave him
something he ended up calling the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was Maui by super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just a straight Maui by super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think better is still holding that
cut view too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's, there's a number,
there's a number of Finos of that that
[SPEAKER_00]: float around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and there's some other stuff we won't
get into right now, cause that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother movie where it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's, it's, it's blended into
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's one of those gigs where it's
like weed reinvents itself every five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every 10 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people only like to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy and popular and it would
probably knock people's socks off today,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it came out at a time when it wasn't
able to get as famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause it was coming out in 2000,
2001, 2002, 2003, you know, it's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was just like a different era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things didn't get like naturally typed
very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it just couldn't spread people that
couldn't communicate as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones didn't spread as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't clone trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't clone mailing, anything like
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so there's an aspect to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That someone's asking if you, uh,
what did you all find out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find a line on anything that you
thought was lost recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so that I thought was lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, uh, there's, you know,
we did get something that I considered to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the Trinity or at least, you know,
extremely, extremely close to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, so, and we, that was lost
for 15 or 18 years to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still not sure if it's the exact
right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if it's even the people that seem
to think it might be not think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly closely related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an S1 or, you know, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's the real one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and now what gets hard is that,
uh, because old things are becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: popular again, everyone's coming out of
the woodwork with old things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that goes back to the fucking
question that dude had about a smear
[SPEAKER_02]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely consider diesel chem skunk
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, diesel and sour diesel and all that
is, is chem is, is chem skunk blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we close it down, I want,
uh, someone wants you to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: Francine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kept, they kept mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Francine was an extremely tasty indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and obviously that's the, that's the
cut that facilitated the trade for the
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, my buddy ended up,
we ended up letting it go because like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of amazing Afghans, uh, it had
horrific rot issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could, it could grow all these big,
beautiful colas and then there'd be gray
[SPEAKER_00]: rot running up the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people had fine had had
issues with breeding a lot of early
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghans because Afghans bred in rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they grew up in a, in a dry,
cold Afghan environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get brought to like moderate
sort of humid California at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just, they just couldn't handle
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it's one of those things where
it's part of the lore, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally dropped for issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's long before any of us thought that
any of this weed that we were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: would matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure too.
You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so yeah, I mean, we've now been
talking two hours and six minutes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's probably, we try to keep it two
hours every Friday, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe now it's a good time if Matt,
if you want to do any plugs or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, go to Google, type in radio
syndicate, Patreon, if you want to go join
[SPEAKER_02]: us on the Patreon, um, probably watching
fights tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, we're always on there
shooting shit, ask us questions there,
[SPEAKER_02]: join in, and we probably going to have
some contests coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, check out speak easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They help us produce the podcast and the
audio version.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go check them out, show them support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, all my stuff's right at cco.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we didn't get to not says manscaping,
so I'm kind of owned about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a, it's probably a two or a
three part show, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, at least it needs props and
pictures, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in general, in general,
two or three parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two or three parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, thank you all for your Friday
night as always, as always for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: give suggestions, give, give ideas,
reach out to us, DM things you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is all about us chatting and
interacting and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, but again, thanks for the Friday
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night.
Okay.
Okay.
