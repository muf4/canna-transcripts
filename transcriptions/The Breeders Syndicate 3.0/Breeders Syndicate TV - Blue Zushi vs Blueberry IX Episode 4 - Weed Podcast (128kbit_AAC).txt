[SPEAKER_01]: What up fam, it's me Chuck Dog,
and I'm back with the episode four of
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders Syndicate TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, YouTube tried to take us out
with a seven day little ban.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't post videos for seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put out a little mini episode the other
night, Friday, when we finally were able
[SPEAKER_01]: to post something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back and watch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back and watch episode one,
two, and three of these Breeders Syndicate
[SPEAKER_01]: TV episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sure would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would mean a ton for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a heads up, I do have a chicken in
this garage right now walking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if she squawks or something,
that's what the sound is.
[SPEAKER_01]: She might jump up right here on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get her out of the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mom kicked me and the chickens out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm living in a garage down the road at
a buddy's house, freezing my balls off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dropped from like 60, 70 degrees to 40
last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm out here with a few sheets and a
pillow, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I got the hoodie on,
because I'm freezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do got a space heater, so we're all
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got the space heater off right now
for sound quality purposes, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to bring you guys the best
quality, the best show, the best
[SPEAKER_01]: entertainment that we can do over here on
Breeders Syndicate TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's some people in the
community who might not like me that much,
[SPEAKER_01]: might think I'm a little bit arrogant or a
jerk or whatever, or play around too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm here to rock out for Breeders
Syndicate when no one else is willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to lay it all on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm willing to leave my ego in the Mozilla
hot tub, get up here and say and do what I
[SPEAKER_01]: got to do to further the Breeders
Syndicate way of living truth,
[SPEAKER_01]: justice in American way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a fork in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost done, but not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a couple of things on this episode,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to be careful, because we can't show
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to re-film this whole episode on the
blue zooshies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I showed macro shots and all this
other stuff in the video I had already
[SPEAKER_01]: filmed for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a rerun or a redo, I should
say, a few hours before it airs tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do apologize if it seems a little off
or the pacing is a little weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freestyle, and it's essentially like I do
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just more freestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got some growing tips for the new
people out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about a couple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not real heady stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to some of you OGs watching,
I know we had a couple people on the last
[SPEAKER_01]: episode say a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's other ways to do a lot of
this stuff that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind, we're trying to make an
episode or a show that will bring in some
[SPEAKER_01]: new faces, some new people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't have the most hideous,
craziest topics for these people at all
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not the one to give it to them
anyways like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to drink some beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to look at some titties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to smoke some blunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what anybody thinks about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can kiss my butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to get hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a jet flying over top of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a jet doing out here?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're here to have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about the drama.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not into the whole breeder drama.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it I find funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will I joke on it occasionally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, but I don't get into it like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really my scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in the middle of the country in
Kentucky, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think I give a shit about what Jimmy
John has to say out in California about
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else or this or that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to give you some education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to entertain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue sushi, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't even know still to this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: My old lady, she picked me up a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been out of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost to harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three or four weeks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've been seeing my
pictures or videos on my little Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm working on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some freaking really good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some blue sour going in there
that's smelling ultimately funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back sour baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I get one sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get freaking, I get going, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the sour comes out, man, I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm freaking getting pumped thinking about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple of blue sours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got skank dog going, one smells raunchy
as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got skank dog going, smelling raunchy as
hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got TK times lupa's headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got lupa's headband times pure OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Kim 91 S1 for Kim dog, for sour,
for OG, for hazes, all that shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got all kinds of stuff going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of Pac stuff, some H&L
genetics going, Southern gothics.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Pac, we got sleep disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Kim dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got all kinds of blue dream crosses
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're rocking now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Matt stuff going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost to harvest time, but I did
have to get some weed from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should kick my own ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really should, but your boy has to get a
head change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't drink anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn into a wild animal if I drink that
tequila.
[SPEAKER_01]: I end up cheating on my wife and doing
crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all see me on TV if I get on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do it and I can't do it,
but I do miss tequila.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get a head change.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes to this new place I've never been
to when she was out grocery shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, you never been in this shop,
Chucky?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something from here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go online and Blue Zushi pops out right
on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Blue Zushi?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt makes fun of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see him mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We joke on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Matt smoked it or knows
anything about it, whatever, but I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be funny and kind of a fun little
episode to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Blue Zushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a whole episode on it and now I'm
here refilming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I open up the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, this machine trim looks like
anything else from a freaking rec weed
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little purple on it, frosty,
giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks are all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't expecting the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't expecting a Blue Zushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry smell of all things,
even though Blue's in the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is rec weed, mind you, so I'm
expecting nothing, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't help but realize I'm getting
the same exact Blueberry Terps,
[SPEAKER_01]: but toned down, way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if this was a grow of a Blue Zushi,
homegrown, maybe on the same level,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as far as what I had there was not on
the same level, intensity wise or range.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was that Blueberry Terp,
but there wasn't a spectrum, if that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: any sense, on the Blue Zushi, but it
brought me back to my grows of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry iX of Matt's.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like Blueberry Terps, if you want
one of the best expressions or the best
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry strange cultivars, whatever you
want to call it out there, pick up the
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry iX or some of the Bluebonnet
work from Matt, but I would recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the Blueberry iX.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to give you the most Blueberry
plant you could really find that I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown a lot of Blueberry stuff,
but definitely can smell Blueberry in a
[SPEAKER_01]: range of Blueberry Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm talking candy, Blueberry pies,
maybe even all the way to muffins,
[SPEAKER_01]: to a sharp candy kind of smell,
and this is what that Blueberry Zushi kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of reminded me of, more of that kind of
sharp candy, Blueberry Terp, or smells,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that didn't really translate to the
actual smoke itself, but the Terps brought
[SPEAKER_01]: me back to the Blueberry iX, which made me
think like, man, like all these people are
[SPEAKER_01]: out here getting hyped off this Blue
Zushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, my boy Matt got the best
Blueberry Terps in the world over here on
[SPEAKER_01]: the iX, and people might say I'm biased,
but I grew them out and they are a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they are some of the best
Blueberry Terps I've had in life,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the only other ones that can
compare would be more of the Bluebonnet
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff through Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the iXs were delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want some Blueberry, that's all for
you right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the high on anything Blueberry to me
is never crazy from the expressions that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just haven't seen crazy potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm not trying to knock on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I smoke a lot of weed,
so a lot of the buds I'm smoking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I need some real potent stuff,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I will say that kind of weed there is
great for going to work because you ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get blasted, blasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to function and still talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that weed is great for waking and
baking, maybe if you like got to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: work or if you got, maybe you ain't trying
to get blasted and laying on the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get blasted hardly any ways off
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I do want some potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say if you want to experience
that Blueberry stuff, check out the iXs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's something I thought was more
important, if you're growing weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're picking up Blue Zushis,
just get a pack of Blueberry iXs,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're regulars, and do some chucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and Matt's telling me I can get
that Blueberry turps to express on a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of different stuff pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me being a chucker, I was standing
there thinking like, why would I even grow
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Zushi if I could grow Blueberry iX?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes some chucks and you can
really pretty easily make your own cool
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry-esque plant with little to no
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand the hype on it,
on the Blue Zushi stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to each their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe if I had a homegrown version of
it, I would speak differently on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's hard to compare one plant
that's grown recreational to four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, homegrown with different
expressions that were all, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did find it interesting,
to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think moving forward, you know,
we're going to talk about more modern
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff to get up in the algorithms and
spread the breeder syndicate message,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we got to be, let's be realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us watching this shit are like 35
plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get some new blood in whether
you like it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next generation is going to have to
take the torch at some point, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to educate, we got to edumacate
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to teach them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to tell them, like, look,
bro, there's other ways to do this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be out here looking like
a weirdo smoking a Blue Zushi,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just grow some blueberry IX like a
normal person, a normal grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're all gravy, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If y'all got a strain that y'all want me
to look up or look into, put it down in
[SPEAKER_01]: the comment section.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go into these weird places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a freaking sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the money rolling in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it to the most,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate to say it, but I think we might
try the watermelon martini.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they should call it watermelon
disappointment, I would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you guys go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: This feels real dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally smell nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe like, yeah, I don't smell anything,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: This ain't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get this mug lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too cold to be lighting lighters in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get her lit up, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that dude wasn't licking on this
before he gave it to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a shake joint right there,
boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a shake joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do y'all do this shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you own a dispensary, don't do this
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nasty, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: God.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like y'all ever run out of weed
back in the day and you scrape all your
[SPEAKER_01]: shake together and smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's like, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hit one more just in case.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want me to do, y'all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they even bother with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just disappointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've been fucked and used up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of weed you fucking just
throw behind you and say, oh, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more wreck pre-rolls, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably lost your respect in this
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shame on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to roll something that
actually gets us high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to jump into the
growing tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be in the comment section on this
video talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you got questions, ask me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking nasty, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like smoking attic dust,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like dust from an attic right off the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the actual fuck, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I just deep-throated a
porcupine or a pine cone or something,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just offensive, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're running game on Chuck Dog up here
in Michigan in some of these spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, shout out to my local spy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I visit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all take good care of me up there for
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of places up in
Michigan in the Battle Creek area that are
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them suck, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, let's get into some grow
tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to roll me up one up while we're
working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For y'all tuning in that are old school
that have been growing for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry this is boring to y'all,
this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do some edumacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And teach the new generation of growers,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, I have two things for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, three, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really got three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've talked about sulfur before,
and I'm sorry that I'm rehashing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wanted to give you guys a visual
that you guys asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have people message me on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't get back to you in time,
I'm sorry, but I do got a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: writing me at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants a piece of Chuck Dogg
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got sponsorships rolling in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got people asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got people sending me dick pics,
titty pics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like titty pics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man or female, I do not discriminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I am particular about nipple
shape, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I might say you got weird
nipples, but don't take it personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we talk about, you know, protecting
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about pests and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, I wanted to talk about some
sulfur because I feel like we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: it before, but people were a little bit
confused because I know I'm a visual
[SPEAKER_01]: learner, too, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see the boobies in front of me or
you telling me the double D's and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: under a shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might think they're A's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see it to believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I think we needed to talk
about to what kind of person would want to
[SPEAKER_01]: use sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a tent, if you got two tents,
if you got a few tents, but they're spread
[SPEAKER_01]: out in different areas of your house,
you know, depending on your climate,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe there's a few different things where
your average little new grower ain't you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really need sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people all the time saying,
my plants get everything they need,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they don't need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a difference, bud,
from growing 10 plants versus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, somebody met the hypothetically
growing a lot of plants, 100 plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe in a small smaller room,
you know, you really at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you were running a lot of plants,
you're really a dummy for not running
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur unless you're just got the super
best climate ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have problems like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at home back in Kentucky,
I'd never had PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never have any kind of problems
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've talked about sulfur before for
using it for PM powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you, it works like a
charm.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have one tent, two tents,
you don't need to sulfur out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't even recommend doing it really
if you're just got a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are in an environment,
I'm next to a swamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm next to woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm next to decaying matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm next to all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to prepare for the worst up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never experienced this in my life
back in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this stuff I'm learning for
the first time myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figure we'll share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're getting PM, especially if
you first off, you need to get your
[SPEAKER_01]: circulation going a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get your fans going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the bottom, blowing on the bottom
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, you won't need to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me up here, I have to have me a
fan on the bottom blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have me one up on the top of the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to have me one blowing up so I
can blow warm air up and out with the
[SPEAKER_01]: exhaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to increase your flow for
starters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're like me and you got plants
crammed and they're so damn tight,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you got too many where you can't keep
up with the full in like you should or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, or you're not training on maybe,
you're going to get running into some
[SPEAKER_01]: problems sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started getting a little PM in the
winter time this season, or this winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get any in the summertime,
except for outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the climate being colder,
shift all cold one day and shift warm the
[SPEAKER_01]: next, Michigan's got crazy weather where
I'm at, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to talking to Bitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen Bitter talking about sulfur,
like using it for plants to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Bitter, home dog, what the heck is
up?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know who Bitter Sweet is,
he's in our Discord, the Breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndicate 3.0 Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the OG God, the goat of the OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's super knowledgeable, probably one of
the most knowledgeable people I even know
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the guys that really knows his
shit and one of the guys I pretend to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, he got to talking about
sulfur one time and I ended up asking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, how you use that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you implement it in your garden to get
a little PM?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck, it's simple, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he recommended Bondi, or whatever you
say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hold it still there for you so you
can look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple different versions of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is gonna be your cheaper version
of powder dry sulfur, whatever you wanna
[SPEAKER_01]: call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can get a better brand that's more
fine that really all you're getting out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it is not having to use so much and it is
finer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the water itself, it's just smaller
particulates or particles, I guess you
[SPEAKER_01]: could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it stays suspended as well,
more in the water too, I'd imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different things, but I actually just went
with the cheaper stuff and it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: working great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way you wanna use this in your
garden, let me finish this up,
[SPEAKER_01]: y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just take care of PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: PM as well takes care of russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think maybe one other thing,
but I know for sure Bitter was saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes care of russets as well,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never experienced russets,
so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some better stuff and I forget
the brand of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe Bitter or somebody can drop the
brand down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe if you guys got some brands of
microized sulfur, put them down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: comments for people to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this one here just because it's
cheap, it's affordable, it's off Amazon,
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes a long way, and it gets to my door
in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I need it, that's what I happen to
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I would have bought the better stuff
if I had more time or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's what I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately that's what I'm probably
gonna use for now, because it works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna implement it into my gardens
outside this year, because we did have
[SPEAKER_01]: some PM outside last year on a few plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that helps me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way you wanna use it in your
garden is if you got a little bit of PM,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanna use one tablespoon per gallon,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a real bad case of it,
you can do two tablespoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really wanna put you a little drop
of soap in there, a little emulsifier,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And put you one little drop of dish soap
in there, and you wanna mix it up real
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's best to use it right after you
mix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have used some that sat around in a
spray bottle for a day or two,
[SPEAKER_01]: it still does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way you wanna use it, at least the
way I do it, as a foil euler, I can't talk
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, you guys, you wanna use it as a
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mix up your little gallon or
however much you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing a half gallon,
you could do half of a tablespoon or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You break it up accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to use these right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zet bottles, I really like Zet,
not because I'm sponsored or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but they just last a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had literally one of these since I
started growing again for the last five or
[SPEAKER_01]: six years and it's never broke on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried some of those little pump,
little tiny half gallon pump ones and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, little gallon ones like,
you know, it's got, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see them in like Lowe's and like the
gardening section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those always break on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seals go bad, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also like using these.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a two gallon one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like these WAND.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the brand I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I ordered this in like a two pack
off Amazon for like 20 bucks or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like these cause you can really,
if you got a tent, you can get up
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath, cause you wanna spray
underneath the leaves and on top and the
[SPEAKER_01]: stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me, I didn't really get much on
my leaves, but I would get it more on my
[SPEAKER_01]: stems, my lower stems, like at the very
bottom, just above the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really liked those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing too is you really want,
you really want to do this at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you do it with the lights on or
in the sun, it'll burn the shit out of
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trust me, I tried it and it not,
I didn't try it, but I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've experimented a little bit and I found
out, yeah, it definitely will burn your
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not by choice, but by accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did burn a couple things, not too
terribly bad, but you can burn them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you don't want to use it if you
have any kind of oils or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put anything like neem oil or
anything oil based on it, you want to give
[SPEAKER_01]: it a few weeks before you put anything
else on it or it's going to mess it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing too is if you got clones,
you can dip your clones, especially if you
[SPEAKER_01]: got like a rock wool cubes, it's really
easy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just take that thing, turn it upside
down and bring it all the way to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, don't put your roots or your,
your actual cube down in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but right above it and just bring it right
down, dip it in real quick and pull it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give a little shake or so,
so it's not real heavy, especially on a
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a bunch of water sitting on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and then what I like to do is when I
do the clones like that, I'll let them
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of dry out intermittently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a chicken in here chewing on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you he's going to make racket at
some point and now she's chewing on
[SPEAKER_01]: styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit chewing on the styrofoam there,
chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eating, eating styrofoam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the weirdest chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, let me shut this thing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, why are you eating styrofoam?
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it, boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mom says don't put me in a messed up
situation, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got chicken living in here with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, damn, my old lady don't even want
to come kicking with me as I've got this
[SPEAKER_01]: chicken hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can dip your clones in it and I really
like that, but something you need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful on, on what that is, if you got
your clones domed, the water is not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to really evaporate off of your dipped
clones that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I like to do is I kind of
occasionally, for like the first 12 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, I kind of keep them more in
the shit, like not in direct light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll kind of put them in ambient light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run some ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're like 35 watts a piece or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a rack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll kind of sit them off to the side a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And occasionally I'll take that dome off
and let that water evaporate or even put a
[SPEAKER_01]: little fan on them, just a little bit
increments at, you know, a little bit at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time, because you can dry your shit,
dry them out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is easier to probably just spray them,
you know, but dipping the clones and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, that's the way I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a paintbrush of some kind,
too, if you have to just hit a few spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you got a plant somewhere and you
want to, you don't want to spray it down
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, whatever, you can go in
there and kind of hit it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: paintbrush, a little bit of that sulfur,
just dip your paintbrush in and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you want to do this like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could do it right as you flower,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right when you flip, you can spray and let
it chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to be doing that shit
like really like after a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: because some stuff will flower faster on
you than others, and it'll burn your buds
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want to sulfur it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a preventative thing,
you know, right when you flip,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's probably going to be your best
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can do it like a weekend,
but you want to do it really before your
[SPEAKER_01]: buds start to, you know, your flowers
start to form and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, man, if you, so if you got
problems with russets or if you got
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with pym, pick you up some,
Mike Rized, I can't talk tonight,
[SPEAKER_01]: y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur, I think this is a, you know,
you could dust it on too if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing it like bitter said with the
soap, because you know, the water in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soap, because it kind of all helps it
stick to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, man, I think I covered
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't use it with the lights on or,
you know, you burn them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a little drop of soap, one tablespoon
per gallon, two if it's real bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it, at least I would say seven
days after flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it anytime after that,
but try to do it right when you flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be better for somebody
that's got a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're running into pym,
get you some sulfur, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff is so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing's like a five pound bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is an extra bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ordered a bunch of them because I'm
not going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have it till I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm always going to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always going to need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, if you got russets,
I can't really tell you how to implement
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming it's the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to know more information
like that, jump over in the discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join through the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's five bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a soda pop nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to know more about
russets, jump in the discord and talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitter or some of the other guys like that
and they'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very thankful for guys like that and
gals, peaches, all y'all to help me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all saved me a lot of headaches,
a lot of time, and a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had a good time doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, another thing I see people talk
about, and this might seem silly for some
[SPEAKER_01]: of you old school growers, your old heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I see a lot of people asking,
when are my plants done?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know when your plants are done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you've grown for a while,
you know by visuals, you know by looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the trichomes, you know by the look of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeding it right, she's fading
pretty good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: She ain't dark green on you when you're
done, or at least she shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most genetics, if you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I like to use one of these
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see people say all the time,
you know, I use my phone and this and
[SPEAKER_01]: that, and that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, they got little things you
can attach to your phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like to cut off something and
take it over to the microscope or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: the heck you want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to use a microscope to see my
cock, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can relate to you guys fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is from AC Infinity and I'm not
plugging them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I use a lot of their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a lot of other people's products
too, but I really like this jeweler's loop
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried an actual jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got even got some, I got this one that
even goes across your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, y'all, I can't see shit with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one actually here, I really like,
because it's got, for one, it's got two
[SPEAKER_01]: different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is a 50 times and then a
hundred times, but I'm not a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent sure on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have already known that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something I really like about these
ones here is it's got a light on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got a light for one side and then
you got a light for another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually get pretty good results
with this and I'm able to actually see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wear glasses sometimes and I can
actually see with those without glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can see with that, y 'all should
be able to see with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that thing's like eight bucks
or something on AC Infinity or through
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only have to go through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure they sell them in
different places and different brands
[SPEAKER_01]: probably have more like these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went with the AC Infinity one
because I was already ordering some stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: from them and they generally make pretty
good products.
[SPEAKER_01]: All their products are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only product I didn't like from AC
Infinity is y'all's dang cheap trimmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody sells cheap trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna show off a good brand of
trimmers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denali gave me a good pair and I swear by
these, I'm gonna give me a couple more
[SPEAKER_01]: pairs because all the ones that grow
companies send you for like freebies are
[SPEAKER_01]: dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They break, the springs go flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw George Jetson, shout out Canada,
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw him, he got him a pair of nice ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, man, I need to give me a pair
of nice ones like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heck, I might go big and go order
something from Japan, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some Damascus steel ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever seen some of them over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those shears they use for bonsai
trees and shit, bro, are thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars, crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna come over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like y'all's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all my little sick cunts down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wasn't from here, I'd be from there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to New Zealand as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Africa, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got that South African, bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate y'all tuning in and watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But get one of them little magnifying
glasses, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at your freaking trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for, I don't know, some people want
5%, 10%, 20%, 69%, 3,000% amber trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at them freaking things.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if they're milky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna look through that little
microscope, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're all clear, you're not ready
to rear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're milky, then it's silky.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a little amber, that's what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's simple as that, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really all the tips I got for y'all
other than, yeah, sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I do got one more tip for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for demonstration educational
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'd be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we got some dabbers in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know some of you old school heads
out there are like, man, dabbing's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little weird too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do got a dab right here that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally when I pick up some of
Peach's stuff, I wanna try something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta have something for when I pick up
some homey stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna try out some concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big concentrate guy,
but occasionally, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: a homey will send me or, you know,
we'll get something going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see people all the time,
they're talking about the old days when
[SPEAKER_01]: people hit your dab rig with the torch
full blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5,000 degrees, fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ain't the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna teach y'all today about cold
starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know what a cold start is,
it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dabbing, a form of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't torture lungs, my guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get this over here so you can see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put some tobacco oil in here,
you know, for demonstration so we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I think they call us a quartz
banger is what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the little names of these,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not really a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I don't know the names of
anything, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anybody to talk to in person
about this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, a cold start's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you're doing is warming up that
tobacco juice, wink, wink, until it starts
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not smoke, I should say vaporize a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll start to bubble and vaporize a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So turn your torch on and hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might take a second or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're watching it start to bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not be able to see the smoke,
but you can see the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see them bubbles?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hit it, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy, simple, simple like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you gotta do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lift it up if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lift your finger off the little
rush hole, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Push a little water, some Kool-Aid,
Mountain Dew, whatever your preference is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you save your lungs, guys,
gals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of the old school guys are
like, what is this guy on talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, we're gonna teach them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna teach them the ways of a chuck
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna save y'all's lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be like me smoking blunts,
smoke cold starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save your lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really all we got for education
today, y'all, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figure we go into a few,
maybe one story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've dragged on a little bit about the
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna maybe just do one story,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tonight, I figure we'll jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see which one I'm gonna give y'all
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do, I think the running through the
field one's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people have heard this one before,
but the viewers that aren't in the Discord
[SPEAKER_01]: probably have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll do that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I dragged down a little bit too
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had three stories planned, but we're
just gonna do one for tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to live in a cabin in Kentucky
with my old lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of lived out on a one lane
road up a gravel road, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: off a beaten trail type of thing,
which is often the case in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I like to be, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be out there in the woods or on
a farm, just away from people,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, because I'm fucking around with
pot and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had three tents rolling,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just flipped, had some really cool
genetics, had some stuff that a guy like
[SPEAKER_01]: me probably shouldn't even really had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people, you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: People give you shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a new bro in a certain community and
give you some shit that you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm growing some of that kind of
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the time, the best run,
the most money I've sunk into a run up
[SPEAKER_01]: until this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm chilling, me and her are chilling
one night in the middle of like summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like, the dog starts barking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the country, when you've got a dog
and a dog's barking, it's supposed to live
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's coyotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or somebody's coming up to drive or
somebody's ram or, you know, maybe they
[SPEAKER_01]: see a deer or something, but usually,
you know, somebody coming up to drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look down, bro, and we're perched up
on a hill in this cabin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the bottom, probably four or 500
yards down, there's a creek, a bridge,
[SPEAKER_01]: a mailbox in the main road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could see the bridge and you can
see people coming across, they're driving
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look down there, bro, and I see two,
like, this is like right at nighttime,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can still kind of make out the shape
of the vehicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two SUVs down there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spotlights on them, like on the driver's
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the hell is that,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her, I said, there's two trucks
down here or two SUV looking things with
[SPEAKER_01]: spotlights on them down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, her dad would come up there
sometimes because we have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: fields up there and stuff that we work and
stuff and grow tobacco and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, are they coming over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they drop big combines and
tractors and shit off all the time at
[SPEAKER_01]: night, like random times for the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, are they supposed to be
over here or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, no, not that I know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like on a weekend night or some
weird shit, bro, like sus time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking and like they're just
sitting there, bro, and they sit there for
[SPEAKER_01]: like 15 minutes, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole time I had just gotten high,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like fucking harvested some
mushrooms, like all shits for myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like I'm tripping because I'm like,
man, like, what the fuck is going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm partying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little bit of, I think I had like
a pina colada or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally I'll drink a pina colada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll drink a pina colada with her or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll make me one and reliving tequila
days, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm sitting there like kind of
paranoid, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just building, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ain't ever got caught doing shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sitting here like, this ain't gonna
be the time, especially when I ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: hustling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just trying to grow some fucking
few plants for me to smoke and just stay
[SPEAKER_01]: out of streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting there looking out the window
and bro, I'm like, these motherfuckers
[SPEAKER_01]: have been here way too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I heard like yelling and like,
or not yelling, but I could hear,
[SPEAKER_01]: I went outside, I could like hear shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could hear talking and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why I didn't think of it
like, but a different way, but my mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, man, I'm about to get raided,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I think, or robbed, one of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her, I said, that's either the cops
or somebody's coming up here to get some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cause I ain't never had really anybody
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's weird that they're even there,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told her, I was like, all right,
flush the mushrooms, get all the weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: get ready to flush the weed and just hang
out in the bathroom and wait for me to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, close all the windows up and the
shades and everything, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So she did it and while she's doing it,
bro, I'm in, this is the most clones I
[SPEAKER_01]: ever had at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in there fucking grabbing clones,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the cubes, grabbing them, grabbing
them, throwing them in buckets,
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon buckets and trash bags,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I run, I get all of them in a bucket,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go to my big tents and I just start
whacking them, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm thinking like, at least if I
hack them down, like I could say there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something else or like, what are they
going to do if they come in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bunch of stumps laying around,
like whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just keep my mouth shut and tell
them, do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm cutting these big ass plants
and then I get to my final tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these motherfuckers back then,
I was growing in five and seven gallons,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're huge, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pots are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I grabbed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's four of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grabbed those four fucking plants,
drag them to like the back door where the
[SPEAKER_01]: back porch is, it faces the fields and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get all those buckets right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just start pushing shit through the
dog door, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we had a big mastiff, so we had a
big dog door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I start pushing these, all these bags
of fucking chopped up plants and all this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit through the dog door, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I take off running out the back door,
open the gate, and I just run as fast as I
[SPEAKER_01]: can, like along the tobacco, like trying
to hide my silhouette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause there's two tobacco fields,
I can run along the barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I run to my neighbor's property,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I dumped him the trash bags over the
field and I run back, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm running back, I like kind of
look down there as I get to the back door
[SPEAKER_01]: and look down at the road and these
fuckers are coming up the driveway,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, fuck, they're coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her, I said, get ready to flush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, if you hear a knock or anything,
start flushing all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, fuck, adrenaline's pumping,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sweating, you know, in my underwear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm like, you know, I think we were
about to hook up or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm in my underwear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running through these fields with the
weed or the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I run back, grabbing them buckets
and I'm running as fast as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go back and grab them two of them
plants and run back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sprinting to hauling ass cause
these fuckers are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming up the driveway,
but it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like coming up like a cop,
bro, like real slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got the fucking spotlights and
they're like looking around for shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if they gonna come get me,
what the fuck were they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm running these plants and run back
to the crib, get all of them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to clean up the tents,
turning all the lights off, shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing random shit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's been there for a while,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm waiting, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they come up, I watch them out the
window.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come up the driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told her like, they not flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, but we ain't open this goddamn
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, and then they come the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna tell them like, Hey,
I'm in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hands are up, you know, kicking the
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a fucking warrant, dude,
you know, and, and I thought I said flush
[SPEAKER_01]: the shit if you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm watching out the window,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they coming up and the driveway kind
of runs in front of the cabin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm running out the back and all my
shit on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got to come around though,
to like, cause we're on a hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to come around to where you can
actually park.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come up and they come around,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they come up behind our truck and
they're sitting there for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard like talking bro, but I'm
like, I ain't going out there or whatever,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogs are barking and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sit there for like 10 minutes shining
spotlights everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the lights off in the house and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling her like, what the fuck is
going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like, I look out the window again
and they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I look out the other window and
they're leaving the driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it dawns on me like, maybe I go look
at my phone real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't looked at my phone this whole
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm shitting bricks, you know,
and I go look at my phone and I got like
[SPEAKER_01]: six missed calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was my neighbor, Tom from up the
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and his wife were in their,
uh, Range Rovers or whatever the fuck they
[SPEAKER_01]: drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're always got weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're up there with spotlights on
their SUVs looking for their cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll call them and, uh, I'm like,
yo, what's, I said, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, oh, you know, sorry to come
up here, you know, on your property,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my wife lost her cat and we got these
spotlights and we were up to just up here
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive around and try to see if we can
find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had him for, you know, 19 years or
whatever it was, some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, you know, that's cool,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, you know, I was like,
man, you scared me, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I know who was pulling up the
driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I didn't come out or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, oh, it's cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And little, he don't know this,
but I'm fucking mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm being, my anger is starting to
build, not really at him, but kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation just cause I just thrown out
probably, you know, two, $300 worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, you know, at least three,
$400 worth of CSI gear, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed kind of growing from seed,
you know, and throw away some really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that I got real early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't have had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, dude, just a gut punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about depressed and not
wanting to grow for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were one of the moments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for like a month, I was just like,
dude, like I'm an idiot, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about feel like a dumb
ass, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When somebody, it's shit like that,
that when somebody calls me a dumb ass,
