of just depends on what the guest or
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't wanting to talk about that being
said You know, we're not I'm not a
[SPEAKER_02]: professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you are happy,
but I'm not a professional So take
[SPEAKER_02]: everything we say with a grain of salt
This is more just kind of you know to hang
[SPEAKER_02]: out in something a little bit less serious
than Matt's show on Fridays and Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's go ahead and take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can start at the beginning with
you happy and maybe talk about your first
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time you heard about weed or the
first time you smoked or maybe your first
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction with it And you know as far as
back as you can remember First
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions was always family because
whenever family got together They'd go
[SPEAKER_01]: sneak off and when you're 10 years old
trying to figure out why everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back into the house happy and
hungry and You know, my dad wasn't the
[SPEAKER_01]: most pleasant son of a gun sometimes and
that family get together He and I are two
[SPEAKER_01]: peas in a pod but When you get him coming
in happy and hungry like oh shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the smell that's where I smelled it
first with that family get-togethers First
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with it was probably 15 years
old with friends Of course all bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean my experience I we didn't get good
stuff out here till probably Right when I
[SPEAKER_01]: started right when I graduated high school
in 92 was when we started Being better
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff because other than that,
I mean dude, we didn't even get the
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas but like when it would come in
green All we got was the brown bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It either smelled like diesel fuel or rain
or something and I mean heck you would buy
[SPEAKER_01]: a quarter hoping for a bug and join out of
it because by the time you got the stems
[SPEAKER_02]: and seeds out, that's what about what you
had I Can relate because I mean growing
[SPEAKER_02]: up, Kentucky You know not super super far
off from where you were probably That's
[SPEAKER_02]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience was all brick we do just
press brown brick we for years probably
[SPEAKER_02]: from I think I didn't really start buying
weed until probably 17 or 18 but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: because I was around older people that
smoked a bunch mainly Reggie and I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really need to pay for it because When we
growing up we would all just stayed each
[SPEAKER_02]: other's houses all the time, you know I
mean fucking as long as I can remember
[SPEAKER_02]: staying over my buddies houses So and I
was real poor dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all my buddies I couldn't have bought
weed until I had a job anyways,
[SPEAKER_02]: really so So but yeah, most of the weed
for the first, you know, four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: years of me smoking Was Reggie brick shit
we pressed up but then we started seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: more like kind of light green stuff that
didn't have as much as many seeds in it
[SPEAKER_02]: and That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had that for About a year or
two and then then we started getting this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff called $10, but or 10 a gram or 15 a
gram 20 a gram and then as we few years
[SPEAKER_02]: into that we finally started getting some
good shit, but Yeah, when you said you
[SPEAKER_02]: said your dad and your family and them
smoke Did you ever was your first time
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking a leftover joint or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it actually just oh, no,
they were way too secretive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean They were way too worried about
covering their tracks and they're damn
[SPEAKER_01]: good at it Because none of them stunk
horrifically when they came back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: house because I think my grandfather to
put a kibosh to that shit real quick beat
[SPEAKER_01]: their ass My grandfather was not a big
guy, but my idol anyway, I Always got mine
[SPEAKER_01]: from buddies because I grew up roughers
And a cop and with some of my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were always the outcast pick on
group, you know And that's why I
[SPEAKER_01]: gravitated I think more towards cannabis
than I did anything else because I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: when you were the cool kid You were
bugging fighting pounding Mac Boone's farm
[SPEAKER_01]: and fucking Mad Dog 2020 I didn't like
drinking all that damn much that don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly enjoy a good bourbon But I don't
sit there I'll have A drink I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to drink the damn bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Put a freaking nice tab in front of me
and now I'm in trouble See I you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say now ain't a drinker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not drinking anymore, but It runs in
my blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: My grandfather was alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother's like said I told you before
we started a recovering addict sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes he's a full-on addict but man
tequila was always my I mean, don't get me
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong We couldn't get bud a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember droughts still I'm sure
you experienced this Yeah, like there was
[SPEAKER_02]: times where we couldn't get bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we couldn't I mean tequila was my
Dude, it made me a problem not a fighter,
[SPEAKER_02]: but man I just get wild and and at goofy
and chase girls and you know, but But we
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't even cheaper it was Natty light
Natty light Milwaukee's best Or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: we can get cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I you know, I've never been a
fucking beer drinker, dude I you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've drank beer before and I threw them
back when I was younger, but I just I've
[SPEAKER_02]: always had a Problem just drinking all the
the fluid, you know itself the fit like
[SPEAKER_02]: the foam and everything I'm sitting bird
and got a piss a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like I like I like shots dude if I'm
going I haven't like I said, I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really drink Anymore I'll have a my old
lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll make me a pina colada every once
while that's a that's about as far as I go
[SPEAKER_02]: nowadays but I'm in the same way though
once I did once I Had a job in a car
[SPEAKER_02]: especially and I was able to get bud all
the time I just as I would rather go to a
[SPEAKER_02]: party and just roll up some joints or some
blunts or Whatever and pass them around
[SPEAKER_02]: and just hang out, you know And you know,
we make friends do you getting drunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: He in the fist fights and your old lady
Oh, yeah problems with the old lady and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that shit, you know So heck I I had a
hiatus because of my kids Because Ohio had
[SPEAKER_01]: such strict damn walls and I was a single
dad with three kids that I quit from right
[SPEAKER_01]: around 97 Till probably 2008 damn I mean
Did you go cold turkey let me ask I always
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder about this shit, yeah Because the
only thing is here I am a single dad and
[SPEAKER_01]: all it took was one of the baby mama to go
Hey, that's how I'm bet you're smoking and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I get pissed for some stupid-ass
reason and I lose all three of my kids I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, you know, I know not there's there's
no I don't care how good it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give it the best shit you've ever
seen In your entire life, you know comes
[SPEAKER_01]: out of a Himalayan fucking mountain man's
golden ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I get to make up for it I was
gonna I was gonna ask you if you had a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship with with your kids now be oh
god Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now my eldest boys in in Norfolk he lives
with his mom, but him and I are really
[SPEAKER_01]: tight and whenever I go see him I bring
him presents Yeah, he doesn't have to he
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have to rent the mason jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just gets them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me happy because I'm real close
with my dad and Maybe that's why I felt
[SPEAKER_02]: the kindred spirit with you a little bit
Just uh, you sound like you're a good good
[SPEAKER_02]: pops and that's good and I understand dude
if I ever had a kid that's something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's probably stopped me from having a
kid is just is Growing I wouldn't say my
[SPEAKER_02]: parents were bad parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were great parents but just when it
comes to financial decisions In life,
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't weren't the best about it the
decisions they made and they had kids when
[SPEAKER_02]: they were young So stuff was you know,
it was rough I mean we grew up taking
[SPEAKER_02]: baths out of buckets and boiling water and
you know Taking shits out back and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever all the bills were cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that being said I had a great
childhood a great upbringing But my
[SPEAKER_02]: parents as far as my parents apparently I
talked to my mom about this recently But
[SPEAKER_02]: she had smoked maybe three or four times
growing up my parents weren't drinkers or
[SPEAKER_02]: drug drug people really my dad smoked when
he was a kid did mushrooms and shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like that, but I wanted to ask you,
uh, did you ever Get a chance to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: with your dad or did you do you have a
relationship with him says you still?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, him and I are very close very very
close now I had a I had a very rough time
[SPEAKER_01]: with him growing up because he was a
little more physical than most I mean fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, I weigh 300 goddamn pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to be a buck 80 Look at me every
time I come over there gig would like god
[SPEAKER_01]: damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you don't believe in revenge I'm
like, why would I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean You know even though my dad got a
little physical with me at times He's
[SPEAKER_01]: still one of the two people that I look up
to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's him and my grandpa and that's what
made me a manual laborer than I am today,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Funny thing about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned your brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I actually work now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a counselor at an addiction outreach
That's cool I work I work in a suboxone
[SPEAKER_02]: clinic That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom's that's what my mom does.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's uh, you know with my brother being
in and out treatment he uh, that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: she's ultimately doing with her life is
kind of just Working in that field and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know just working that's where she works
at a hat like a recovery center Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge she brings is so beneficial
to the people that will come through that
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even funny and She knows how to
read tells Yeah, I mean that's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: thing about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know anybody can sit there,
you know, I mean You've been around your
[SPEAKER_01]: brother, you know, and I'm sure you love
him to death But you know damn good and
[SPEAKER_01]: well hopefully sit there and lie to you
when he's on a bad in a bad spot
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with him, you know, you can't even
lend him $10, dude Cuz you know that $10
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think I'm helping him out by
getting him a cheeseburger or whatever He
[SPEAKER_02]: he'll go off and use that for something He
don't need to get into him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah not to take it into a dark tone
But yeah, that's I think everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: affected by these types of things nowadays
I think everybody family member or a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend that's going through this kind of
shit So I think it's it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: important to talk about but and then
Everybody needs to remember that if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's somebody in treatment man,
give them their prompts Even if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling still give them their prompts
because they're they're trying to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: change Yeah, I mean dude, it's it's rough
man And I hope anybody that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: through that kind of shit can get the help
that they need dude I talk and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: that you got to want to change man You
know, we've we both lived rough lives and
[SPEAKER_02]: made mistakes I'm sure but you got to want
to change to get better when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of stuff Don't matter how many
people want to help you You got to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make that decision to get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, maybe back will steer back
towards marijuana is here but uh Maybe uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: so as you you're smoking with your friends
and stuff like that Maybe did you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: ever attempt to grow or at what point did
you decide?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I want to try to grow some of this
shit So we live I grew up in the suburbs
[SPEAKER_01]: and We had a huge community center behind
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 15 soccer fields behind us in
Harrison, Ohio and Behind it was a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried growing in the woods,
but we were so damn deep into the woods
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean And you know we had found some
seeds in a bag of I think one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy's brother, you know You know his his
older brother stuff And that's where we
[SPEAKER_01]: got most of our stuff from was his older
brother in the very beginning But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we put it in the ground I don't
think any of them ever sprouted and then
[SPEAKER_01]: after the tornado came through Harrison
and that's a neat fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the first ever episode of rescue
9-1-1 but back to eat We moved out into
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle of nowhere and Harrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it it country out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it But it's in the woods so there's
no farmland So all you got to do is go
[SPEAKER_01]: find the biggest tree that just fell down
and I mean we've got some scraggly stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing Like I'm getting the privilege I
mean it was barely above the brick If you
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me the bullshit fucking mylar stuff
they got today and I'm talking to BS stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the stuff that you can find it still
decent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather smoke I'd rather smoke the
brick because I got high as a damn tight
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was shit weed and It didn't look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But damn did it get you baked?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say I missed those days because
the shit we were getting bro look like the
[SPEAKER_02]: got Coca-Cola poured on it and fucking I
mean You smoke a joint bro and the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: ash is black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah Yeah, I mean I can't say I miss
Miss that but I do know what you're saying
[SPEAKER_02]: There is that those mylar bags nowadays
that are fucking track and I've seen some
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get some shit at some of these
Dispensaries that's like the cheapest shit
[SPEAKER_02]: they got it's like $20 ounces $30 ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks damn near like that shit just
without seeds do you know all oxidized and
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking dark looking shit, but but it's
just Okay, I'll ask you your opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: because you do go to a lot of dispensaries
and I've had to hear also in between grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and different shit like that Oh,
yeah, everything smells like nothing Like
[SPEAKER_01]: packing peanuts almost like like there's
no smell to it It smells like the inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the mylar bag and I don't know if
that's just from the cures or the strange
[SPEAKER_01]: selections because they're trying to flip
them at six weeks every strain they get a
[SPEAKER_02]: hold of because it's Well, it's probably a
combination of multiple factors right you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably pull they're probably pulling
early just because of The industry and how
[SPEAKER_02]: it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably probably You know pumping
them full of nutrients do they're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: cure is probably quick or or or not slow
enough or whatever And also are they
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying for stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's so many things that could go
into that Now I will say like I've made it
[SPEAKER_02]: a mission to explore all the fucking
dispensary That I can find in my general
[SPEAKER_02]: area, which is you know upwards to like 20
plus and in my oh Yeah, sit in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably You know 15 minutes away
or so I'm in the country myself So I do
[SPEAKER_02]: after driving in town, but over the last
year I've made a an effort to go check
[SPEAKER_02]: everything out and you know I've made
multiple purchases that several of them to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure I get a good Idea of what they
offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean when you're talking about my what
you were talking about specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier They all offer that prepackaged
mylar shit, you know real colorful
[SPEAKER_02]: packaging Usually sold in eighths,
you know, they're trying to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: attention with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're trying to get Indiana,
Ohio, Kentucky Pennsylvania and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: up sits up there coming up to get the
fucking cheap ass mid Yeah, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, of course and and that's a big
that's the thing I I even talked to I
[SPEAKER_02]: asked some of these people shit man like I
asked this girl that wasn't working and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever I was like, you know,
I've been busy today because it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think and she's like, yeah, and you're
the She's like you're the first person
[SPEAKER_02]: that from in state that's come in today
out of a hundred people So that that right
[SPEAKER_02]: there is telling you a lot a hundred and
some people I'm talking this is a like 10
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 or 11 o'clock in the morning or
something and they open up at like 9 or 10
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all out of state people and this
is during the summer So I mean during the
[SPEAKER_02]: summer they're crushing it because you got
out of people out of town people come into
[SPEAKER_02]: boats To fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Michigan is a great place for
that, you know To finish up my point about
[SPEAKER_02]: the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this you are gonna find a lot
of that stuff, you know I call it soulless
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, you know, a lot of it's machine
trimmed a lot of it is Early pulled early
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that, but I will say that often
you can find at least one or two things in
[SPEAKER_02]: that store that Even a seasoned person you
might not walk away Extremely satisfied or
[SPEAKER_02]: blown away, but I have tested this out
with people that that I mean some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys in the discord even I've when I met
up with them in person at parties I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: slip some of the shit into some of the
smoke and not many people can tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference if you if you got the right All
right thing or the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the right strain or cultivar
whatever, but I will say lately I've I've
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like try to go to the more
expensive places People that are more I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't say it's not Fully integrated
because they have separate locations,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they grow their own stuff along with
other stuff local people local farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus they have the prepackaged stuff now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say like on that stuff Yeah,
it is worth an extra ten dollars on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce to buy by that if you are gonna buy
anything I will say that a lot of that in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and a couple of these stores and I
won't name them but that was pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke dude is it better than Yeah,
would I grow or what my buddies grow your
[SPEAKER_02]: is what I prefer that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll know but You know if I was coming
here out of state For a day or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be pretty satisfied with the
overall experience now going into going in
[SPEAKER_02]: these places looking for experience on
Strains or or how to grow or any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not gonna get that I don't think
for most part, but yeah, what about your
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences with with with rec?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Ohio just went rec not so long
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's I I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that I've bought in God I
want to say four or five years that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever actually been able to smell is is
always The the Jack or the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing I've ever been able
to smell Everybody's like oh this smells
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm like dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so full of shit You want to drag
that kid into the house and bring him into
[SPEAKER_01]: the shed like hey Why don't you come in
here and stick your nose in this pen?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you what that it's like I got
to grow some amazing stuff in the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning when I first came to the discord
I was getting into CSI pretty damn heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean, there's so many people here
that grow Caleb stuff, too But my god the
[SPEAKER_01]: different smells that came off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome Yeah, I mean I should
excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say In the last year,
there's probably only been two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I would ever think about
Potentially growing or even really wanting
[SPEAKER_02]: to smoke again or one of them I had
recently was the I can't ever say it
[SPEAKER_02]: right, bro, cuz I got like a third grade
reading level.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the Dolce de uva or whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't ever say yeah that that was
actually decent I've seen some of the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: in the discord out and Cali talk about
that too if it's the same cut it's It's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty decent for what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you were saying bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing compared to you know,
a good H&L pack of seeds that I pop of
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, you know, it doesn't even
compare especially when you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about if you've cured it, right It was a
good grow if everything went perfect,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I know it's hard to do when you're
growing but but yeah You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'd rather I'd rather grow home girl
smoke home growing all day if I can,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but So at what point did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a little bit more serious about
growing I guess or or maybe start Buying
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics because you said you were getting
stuff out of bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't you know little bags and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always smoking backseat once I knew
that I wasn't gonna get in trouble with
[SPEAKER_01]: the kids cuz I mean I had The Rob Clarks
indoor grow Bible that was the first book
[SPEAKER_01]: I ever bought and it's just before I mean,
I just wanted I just wanted and Did
[SPEAKER_01]: really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, yeah, sorry named the wrong one But
then I bought the other one with the two
[SPEAKER_01]: fellas that wrote it the indoor grow Bible
the white one blue letters and then that
[SPEAKER_01]: one I bought those both from a place
called high on the hill in Cincinnati That
[SPEAKER_01]: place always made me laugh because you
couldn't say bong those people would lose
[SPEAKER_01]: their goddamn mind if you said bong Like
come on man, but I got it they could get
[SPEAKER_01]: in trouble But so I started reading and I
am one of those people that loves I am a
[SPEAKER_01]: DD like a son of a gun So I want to make a
t-shirt with a chrome squirrel on it that
[SPEAKER_01]: says on the back of it Oh shiny and on the
bottom of the shirt says squirrel But But
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana itself is always always had a
place in my heart and I'm always trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn about it and and Where I really
started getting into it honestly was the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast the first couple episodes when
Duke got on there and you know was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: it up and then skunk BA was the second one
Matt was on right after that and I fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: I Taked his ass down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's when I started really
listening to Instagram and everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: with Matt and you know Religiously
watching his lives on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't know how much the patreon
would cost and I was strapped his tail
[SPEAKER_01]: back then and You know Anything I could
find that was giving me information and
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and all the guys would give you
places to go look So, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been at it in the shed probably four
or five years now And I it's just it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that I think I'm doing all that
great It's just I'm taking the knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm learning from these guys that I
really look up to That's that's exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what this podcast was all about bro,
it's not for me I want to get people on
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe I'm not saying you just in
general, but myself hell I fuck grows up
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time Just people who are actually
out doing it enjoying it more on a smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: scale people joke I hear all these fucking
podcasters talk about we doing it for the
[SPEAKER_02]: tent growers at home and all this shit and
but then they interview like the worst
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the world, so and of course
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can't bullshit a bullshitter no,
you can't I just you know, I I just wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to do something that is more at home with
like what we're actually Doing it in
[SPEAKER_02]: people like us because it's like you said
it doesn't matter if you're the best
[SPEAKER_02]: growing the world I mean work,
you know, I'm learning every day myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned from everybody in the discord
and it's a journey really I know it sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: corny, but I don't think I was talking to
one of the guys the other day about this
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember who it was but it was
somebody in the discord, but it's growing
[SPEAKER_02]: weed You know you were learning until
basically you're you're about to die when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're old enough You're you're at a point
where you're a master at it and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: die a few years later But but no,
you know, it's just a learning process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm like you dude I make mistakes
too, but sorry to cut you off there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh No, no, you're fine Yeah, I wouldn't
I'll be I'll put it out on front street
[SPEAKER_01]: and be completely honest with you I would
have never known that I had strips unless
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the guys in the discord would have
pointed it out to me and I respect the
[SPEAKER_01]: hell out of this dude and I'm very
thankful we did it because now I know what
[SPEAKER_01]: the hell to look for and now we're going I
live on a farm dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm constantly having to do work on a farm
I mean and it's 82 acres and it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's five houses and it's all family
and I'm the man You'll labor that knows
[SPEAKER_01]: how to fix shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fixing shit out in the fucking weeds
constantly, but then I think oh shit I got
[SPEAKER_01]: to go water Yeah, I think you know and now
I take that a hell lot more serious,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know guys are always like I gotta
change clothes before you go and fuck that
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 hours fucking fixing a cattle fence,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not No, I gotta go water and that's
that's what caught me in the ass is is
[SPEAKER_01]: from mowing and weed whiff and I know
that's what it's from and I just Infected
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants, but if anybody's curious That
right there Like a sound bitch I was about
[SPEAKER_02]: to pull my bottle out but I I got a couple
bottles Hanging up here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was you're talking about thrips man You
know, I've also been fucking around since
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like 14 15 16 growing bag seeds I
like I don't even consider myself a grower
[SPEAKER_02]: back then because I never even really
would Get to harvest a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was I was growing in my mom's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hidden remind you in a fucking
closet I was growing in rental property.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would get to certain points where I'm
about to flower and of course I'm learning
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time too back then I was on 420
Chan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what just at the time That's what I
was using to learn and I watched a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the horror Jorge Cervantes grow videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would download them off like love lime
wire and shit, bro pirate Bay and And 420
[SPEAKER_02]: Chan, that's how I was learning and But
back to my point I Over these last
[SPEAKER_02]: probably about a year and a half maybe two
years before kovat hit I started fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: around with growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say serious, but I had a tent
right and Over these last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing it non-stop and some of
the I've never really had some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: issues that a lot of the guys have gone
through with thrips might shit like that I
[SPEAKER_02]: just got lucky I had a few spider mites
with one of my first grows because I was
[SPEAKER_02]: taking Stuff in and out like a dumbass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But but this summer moving up to
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a totally different environment,
dude It's it's it's a lot more challenging
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say for me inside and out Humidity
is a little different humidity and Mold so
[SPEAKER_02]: out last year last summer last season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Did some of H&L stuff outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: and Didn't have really I saw a few spider
mites here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're nothing crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also had never seen a threat
before bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bring everything in back in October
and harvest everything and you know I try
[SPEAKER_02]: to clean all the leaves that stuff off and
much as I could outside before I brought
[SPEAKER_02]: them in I Kind of would do showers like
you were saying that especially I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely change clothes maybe not
shower all time, but anyways month Or two
[SPEAKER_02]: after outdoor harvests, I brought
everything in I've had everything in for
[SPEAKER_02]: about a month and stuff My plants are
doing shit, bro and one dent specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was an H&L girl that I was doing
and What the fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: I started looking at the leaves and I see
these little things crawling around them
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little spit looking Marks all over
all over one of my bubba crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And bro, I was like what the fuck so
I get to look in and I'm like man I got
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of look online and look in the
discord shit Like that, you know how it is
[SPEAKER_02]: you try figure out what you got going on
diagnose the problem and sure enough had
[SPEAKER_02]: thrips dude and I fucking You know barely
made it to the end of the harvest my
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest was fucked But I still got some
plants out of it and some seed out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, dude Just fuck my but long story
short not short I guess you should say was
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the first time experiencing that
dude and it just was such a depressing
[SPEAKER_02]: time for me because I didn't know how to
manage it and something I do I use some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that spray that you got the what is that
called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. I always forget what it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah Bondi's or blondies or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some sulfur shit I ordered
recently, but anyways H&L accident high
[SPEAKER_02]: lonesome recommended me that same shit
when I was going through the my throat
[SPEAKER_02]: problem and it and it kicked its ass to it
like I Could within a few days maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: What what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice Yeah, dude, so yeah, man,
thanks to H&L I kind of shut everything
[SPEAKER_02]: down took everything down to clones
cleaned everything out spray to fuck for
[SPEAKER_02]: like three or four weeks didn't really
grow anything really fucked my Harvest up
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's why I recently did had to go
get some we do cuz I fucking ran out I
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked all my pea haze I smoked I smoked
it all dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bunch of butter left But sometimes
and I'm not that type of dude or I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna ask my buddies for favors I
just I'm not that type of guy really so
[SPEAKER_02]: for me I'll just go pick something up and
deal with it, you know, but uh Back to my
[SPEAKER_02]: point thrips dude that shit sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It taught me a lot and I feel like
failures bro make you the better grower
[SPEAKER_02]: Than not have failures because now moving
forward I I don't have an issue to worry
[SPEAKER_02]: about thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you can agree You know how to
handle it, you know what to look for
[SPEAKER_02]: that's something you probably look for now
for now on like oh, yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the snail trails is the instant
giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you've got many snail trails on
your leaves, you got strips You could see
[SPEAKER_01]: them to at least the ones I If you flip
over the seed or flip over the seed if you
[SPEAKER_01]: flip over the leaf and are normally on the
bigger fan leaves That's where they go
[SPEAKER_01]: first because there's there's more for
them to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah You'll see the really tiny little
white flecks and then when they get older
[SPEAKER_01]: they turn to black and then they start
flying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep Yeah, and I think too what I think
word what got me fucked up is I seen a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple flying Originally bro, and I and I
wanted to say I just thought they were
[SPEAKER_02]: mats, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't really Pay much attention
because but if you get to looking at them,
[SPEAKER_02]: they look totally different They almost
got like the ones I have were almost had a
[SPEAKER_02]: reddish hue to them Kind of looking things
once they were flying very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't stay up very long and
they're yeah Like you said, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different color where the
fungus mats are a little darker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, almost black Yeah, that's the thing
is I when I I realized that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: terrible flyers so I just increased my
fans doubled up on fans and Sticky trap
[SPEAKER_02]: the fuck everything out dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean sticky so many goddamn sticky traps
You could couldn't walk an inch without
[SPEAKER_02]: getting one on you, dude I get them in my
hair and everything, but uh, but then see
[SPEAKER_02]: I get those taken care of and now I got a
tent right now That's fucking p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, not extreme stream, but just on the
lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done stripped everything out I've
increased my airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've my fucking humidity is right on
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: My temps are on point the only thing I can
think of is I'm middle Winter I have an
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced winter up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a little different I'm actually
installing an airbox with a filter a
[SPEAKER_02]: filter box today and another exhaust up
into my attic today so hopefully that will
[SPEAKER_02]: help and then I also got some sulfur shots
some powder sulfur showing up and I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna take clones of Just I don't it's
just one fucking tent, bro I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: understand not not a single lick of it in
the rest of the fucking garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just is 110 in the corner is I've
cleaned this motherfucker two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: times it's just Just a little bit of p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, so I'm gonna fucking you know What's
funny is I had I was reading and I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember my grandpa and them using fucking
milk dude Like what is like a third to
[SPEAKER_02]: two-thirds water?
[SPEAKER_02]: and bro out I Was already I already got
the sulfur on the way bro, and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some redneck shit right here I
said, I wonder if this is work and I and I
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the plants I had it Bro,
they were like on their last little leg
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a couple on there right up and
bro, and I'm not recommending this to
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody but for me I sprayed them dude and
sure enough the next day not even eight
[SPEAKER_02]: hours later, but I'll come I look in that
tent took all the mold out bro,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course now I got this fucking dried
milk on everything right took all the mold
[SPEAKER_02]: out and the new growth the new growth is
Is coming through the greened up?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of surprised me now I don't know
if that's gonna affect when I go to dip
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for if I need to or not,
I don't know I you know and I need to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: to a couple guys bitter gave me the
Recommendation of using sulfur because
[SPEAKER_02]: that takes care of molds that takes a
meal, you know mildews for p.m You know
[SPEAKER_02]: mites russets or whatever and a few other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So If I can't get it with the milk,
I'm hoping the fucking sulfur takes care
[SPEAKER_02]: of it If not, I'm gonna cut them all down
and start start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I don't know But well,
that's the beautiful thing about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: too If you really think about it just from
the damn patreon package is alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this going out on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yep Okay, if you're watching this
join the discord, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't go in on the $5 going in on
$50 You're always gonna get more than what
[SPEAKER_01]: you pay for I can take I can attest to
this I'm a damn nobody and I'm giving some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the greatest damn seeds to grow well
Hey, maybe people don't might might not
[SPEAKER_02]: know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So So in the breeder syndicate discord,
we actually Have tier systems and you
[SPEAKER_02]: could join for five bucks that just gets
you the discount on everything on
[SPEAKER_02]: riotseeds.com Or not everything but most
of the stuff on there specifically Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt's gear and a few other guys and then
there's a 15 tier and then there's a 50
[SPEAKER_02]: tier $50 tier which a lot there's
confusion on this I wanted to say This
[SPEAKER_02]: here so people understand It's you get a
pack per month at that $50 tier But
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes Matt will do it, you know once
there's two to three or four built up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it saves on Is what he's trying to
shoot for is every every month he tries to
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot one out and and I mean If you grow
what the hell you just got from him in
[SPEAKER_01]: that patreon package There's no way in
hell you're gonna be ready for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: picture In there right now and the
blueberry I actually I mean I got the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry I a T 1000 and I got off of bone
toads for Jesus and The granddaddy first
[SPEAKER_01]: time space queen and the hash plane time
space, please And and the good thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is is I was actually able to give
the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you in the Vegetative state
because of where I had to flip the click
[SPEAKER_02]: the last time to get in on the contest
Yeah, man Speaking of the blueberry IX
[SPEAKER_02]: dude Those things are the more squat and
chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand we're talking about
vegetative growth and in my run,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude I enjoyed all I did four of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest are males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Enjoyed that the blueberry so much man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The turps were spot-on blueberry And dude,
I actually am like you dude I don't feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like I did it justice because I actually
took the mail and hit it to him so I can
[SPEAKER_02]: get some more seed and I'm a cheap bastard
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm chucking everything I got I want more
seeds dude, but uh So I made more of it so
[SPEAKER_02]: I could kind of do my own run in my own
little little hunts I guess if you call
[SPEAKER_02]: them, but yeah, I also feel I want To veg
mine out or even do one outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be fun to do outside,
but Apprehensive of growing anything
[SPEAKER_01]: outside around here because of our damn
humidity it I mean once it's October we
[SPEAKER_01]: get so funky here That I mean I'd almost
have to dig out a six inch deep freaking
[SPEAKER_01]: platform and put sand in it But then I got
to worry about everything else Put a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse over top of it to keep the
humidity down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean That's how we used to do it at the
farm when I was growing at a farm that I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to work at we'd grow winter plants on
float beds, but you had to have Sand in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle of the aisle to help take the
moisture off of the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had last season up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Just was a little hesitant about growing
stuff because it was my first season so
[SPEAKER_02]: and I didn't know what to expect so what I
I just Said hey, I'm gonna put stuff in
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna add any soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna add anything I'm just gonna
see what it does on its own just to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: base idea and Dude, I put it some hypey
stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put some Some some stuff from the
discord a lot most stuff that I put out
[SPEAKER_02]: was from H&L the rank strangers,
which you know, those are a haze a Mango
[SPEAKER_02]: haze cross that's the Kim D times the
mango haze and dude I I didn't think it
[SPEAKER_02]: was gonna finish but it ended up finishing
up here and it was the least moldiest
[SPEAKER_02]: plant I had I don't think I really had any
mold maybe like a nug or two but do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that was purple for some reason
just fucking Molded the fuck out bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that bad like that Yeah,
yeah, but that being said I had a what was
[SPEAKER_02]: it the dog walker snacks from Cronzo I
think and I'm sorry if I'm Getting that
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's I can't keep track all these
names and shit, but I think is the dog
[SPEAKER_02]: walker snacks That was a little bit more
dense, but that came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't purple, but it did come out
Didn't have much mold on it like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but yeah, man Growing outside is
fucking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a new experience and probably the
most fun I had I went in into it thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: like man None of this is probably gonna
work out because a lot of guys are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh dude You're gonna get mold shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some but it was fun, bro
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted they're telling you it's gonna
mold it but shit you're learning You're
[SPEAKER_01]: not trying to freaking harvest a bunch of
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's see what the hell happens Yeah,
the whole verbiage of throwing shit on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wall and see what's this Yep, and you
you're hella lucky up there compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: where you grew up It's like my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't nothing but fucking play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and you get up there and there's Yep,
you know It's yes, it's all sand It's all
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking sand, dude That being said this
year, dude, I'm gonna run H&L soil mix He
[SPEAKER_02]: gave me his little recipe that he runs
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna run I'm gonna mix that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think and this year I'm gonna be fucking

[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean go to Harbor Freight and get
yourself a fan Yeah, and you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily get a greenhouse fan,
but you want to move a shitload more air
[SPEAKER_01]: than what you're comfortable with People
understand once you put that damn once you
[SPEAKER_01]: put that plastic up how much moisture that
trapped in there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this year I'm gonna cut me a big
Swaff I'm gonna cut me a big cut all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way around my my area far get all the weed
shrimp way way way down And just yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: just really just try to do it to the max
this year, you know Because last year I
[SPEAKER_02]: saw what I was shocked because dude I had
plants that were big as me bro or bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: than me And I put out I put I want to say
I put everything out Mid-july or late,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was late for what they could
have been in there huge but but let's get
[SPEAKER_02]: into some These questions here,
man We're getting on a long rant here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get this fine, but we'll get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get in some of these questions I got
a little Compiled some stuff here and
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll go through Maybe we'll start with
what's your all-time favorite strain and
[SPEAKER_02]: why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pack strain rack Hands down this smell the
effect the gross the fucking the absolute
[SPEAKER_01]: beauty of that plant is unreal I mean
You've not grown true trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah blocks who gives not When
you're done and you harvest that that is
[SPEAKER_01]: something I think you can keep in the jar
for 15 damn years and it feels good I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: this cardboard turps BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a beautiful damn plant and right
damn behind it This mango haze can 91 that
[SPEAKER_01]: we had for the H&L 500 stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have literally made
[SPEAKER_01]: My first flower test a week in the drop so
it still has a little poor for me It's
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it doesn't I don't think it takes
any different because you're pressing it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Have not hit it That's awesome Today
like when I smoke it tonight, I would
[SPEAKER_01]: still get the same effect that I did on
that first day You can't knock that you
[SPEAKER_01]: got two beautiful crosses You got like
like H&L said the whole reason he put them
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two favorite screens and Neither does
mango haze and the funny thing about it
[SPEAKER_01]: The more mango I get the more funky and
leaning smell But the longer I'm burping
[SPEAKER_01]: these jars in the longer it cures the more
that fruity Almost fermented mango on the
[SPEAKER_01]: more family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's permanent mango That's awesome That's
awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got goat farm with the train wreck,
which is the Arcata the s ones I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: assuming right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got three of those When people say the
port when people say support the discard I
[SPEAKER_01]: got those because I bought the Santa Cruz
blue dream Are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Santa Cruz blue dream off of him
when the s ones first came out That was a
[SPEAKER_01]: thank-you package that I got for buying
the blue dream off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with the damn train That's awesome
Talk about cooking it up the blue dream
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcast we might as well talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the ones and all those all those
crosses dude super metal top hazy smell I
[SPEAKER_01]: have personally in the three plants that
I've grown I have not gotten the blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: and mine have all been that metal shop a
amazing Holy smoke stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah before we before I forget The Kim 91
times the mango haze is part of the H&L
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 That's a little grow competition that
it's kind of concluding actually will be
[SPEAKER_02]: concluding tomorrow officially on the
fourth their little grow competitions that
[SPEAKER_02]: we do where Like this one specifically we
grew out H&L's 91 times the mango haze and
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's 15 or so contestants in
this one and Basically what we do is we
[SPEAKER_02]: run run the plants we send out the We send
out the seeds and everybody runs the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and then we judge based on visuals
and things like that The overall winner
[SPEAKER_02]: and we do like, you know top three with
prizes And then there's a belt as well
[SPEAKER_02]: that we always have on the line It's like
a little not a full-size belt,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's a little miniature kind of
wrestling Championship belt with that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a solo cup competition with the
belt previous to that one and We're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 and actually we just sent out All the
pock stuff speaking of pock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had just sent all the goat farm pock
stuff for the most recent contest Which is
[SPEAKER_02]: a mystery grow and we got I think probably
I think there's nine different cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, whatever have you people's choice
of Terminology, whatever the fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, we Got nine different
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 30 some people are running in this
one and I just popped mine my sevens and
[SPEAKER_02]: my fours are all popped a hundred percent
Germination brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to rock And that's the thing any
of the stuff that I've done for a buck or
[SPEAKER_01]: high-end lens and the germination has
always been a hundred percent now if I've
[SPEAKER_01]: watched anything for germination was
completely on me we've been enough when
[SPEAKER_01]: the seedlings were coming up because I use
the No, I don't know if I have one in me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just need to kind of lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought them off a team unit And they're
just a little Frick can seed starters that
[SPEAKER_01]: are like that tall that they have the
clear plastic lid and then on the top and
[SPEAKER_01]: I put cocoa in there and put it in my darn
clone tent and the one that I showed you
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, it's double-shelled and I've just
got freaking Stoplights because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: 6000 Kelvin and I remember how many lumens
but yeah, I'll do days for yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you put them and it's just as bright
as an HLT because I've got two of the HLT
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I uh, yeah I'm always impressed
with how much you can get out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: space, dude I mean I've seen what you what
you're working with and what you do I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: always impressed dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome I Understand dude,
it's my peace and serenity my place where
[SPEAKER_02]: I chill and get high and think about stuff
Maybe we'll rock on to another one of
[SPEAKER_02]: these Questions here What strain would you
recommend to someone new to cannabis maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: for beginners That you that you've grown
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I should say Girl's best friend
because you're gonna bring in it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: hype enough Because you've got the warm
cookies times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna introduce them to him Is the
chem dominant in that one and it grows
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievably inside I mean Or any of any
of the bubacrosses But now, you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you know because I wouldn't suggest
trainwreck Because you're gonna freak out
[SPEAKER_01]: when it starts flopping But I have to get
a burger 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would point anything talk or high
and lose them Do in don't play gas and
[SPEAKER_01]: only put one And you then of course any of
my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that blueberry stuff But that's
another one you almost wanted a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: under your belt because you
[SPEAKER_02]: Know I would have to agree on The
blueberry and the trainwreck really is
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries easy to grow But I feel like
yeah, I mean If you were I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd want to do that my first if I was
recommended I would actually recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said it's a million times skank dog,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an easy pleasure Dude, you could grow
that with low inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can I'm doing full strength Tara Tara
canna right now and it's eating it up dude
[SPEAKER_02]: big chunky leaves I mean in this the stock
on one of these plants bro, I kid you not
[SPEAKER_02]: is this is the Thickness of my finger
while all the other ones are like maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: pencil like it's a plane, dude and dude a
Stacks nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chunky dense stinky raunchy skunky
kind of coffee bitter smell to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, it's just It is what you know,
it's one of my favorite favorites to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: and dude it comes out pretty consistent
That's another thing too, you know Just
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out really consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but another one you said that bubbles
I think H&L has the pre-98 bubbles Times
[SPEAKER_02]: the Kim D times Appalachia dude,
that one was another easy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was raunchy It's stacked nice all this
stuff that I usually talk about is from
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do run clones of stuff I try to but man
I'm usually going through so many plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that I usually just will and I like to run
the seed plant or you know, the the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: from seed first and then I'll take cuts if
I like it and then run, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just the way I do it Some people like
to take cuts for more stability and shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like that and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just On everything I see everything that
I pop from seed I try to take three to
[SPEAKER_01]: four a Redneck version of an area hundred
or very upon a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've literally got how many fights on that
day and just a 27 gallon that I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: weather on the top of the lid and then you
know, I On four and not four corners,
[SPEAKER_01]: but two on each side because they handle
quick But I've got enough hot When you run
[SPEAKER_01]: that on pump in the spreader emitters,
it'll move down So you want to put little
[SPEAKER_01]: plants on the side to do it against the
thing or against the weather so things
[SPEAKER_01]: like I Try to run coins on everything that
I do and then I'm done with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that to be I'm not looking
at breathing The only thing I ever want to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to do anything like it's gonna be 500
stuff because I know there's no more seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: of it Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my spray I'm gonna do my business
on probably two runs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a five by five of nothing but
of that And I mean just yeah, I'm not so
[SPEAKER_01]: much of a nice killer stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's another thing too for me
like I want to work through so much shit
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can't keep every fucking thing bro,
and I'm not So much of an expert on weed
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think I got everything I pop is
fucking the greatest So I I I mean is
[SPEAKER_02]: there some stuff that I've lost that I've
popped that I'm like damn I wish I had
[SPEAKER_02]: more of it but sure but it's like you said
dude I'll just go get more seeds of it
[SPEAKER_02]: dude right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that being said though bitter and a
couple of the guys were saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Your you think like that until
you do lose the one of the greatest ones
[SPEAKER_02]: you've had and then you feel like shit but
but I'm kind of like you I want to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through seeds and I want to look through
different shit and if I find something
[SPEAKER_02]: great You know, I'll pop more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know also I like to do a little
chucking, you know, I don't like to I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't call it breeding I like to just
chuck a little bit cuz a lot of stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: the guys are Making our rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean some of it's been worked too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But You know, I always have a mail around
or at a stage where it might as well do a
[SPEAKER_02]: little dusting bro, so And obviously the
offspring aren't gonna come out exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: how you want or maybe they don't may they
come out shit Maybe they don't come out
[SPEAKER_02]: close to the parents whatever but yeah,
you know, it is what it is but that's I
[SPEAKER_02]: got so much seed at this point that I've
gotten from homies and the discord and the
[SPEAKER_02]: patreon and that I've chucked my stuff to
look through probably a couple lifetimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I Get it I get it because you're
always gonna have but the thing is to my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites I know I can go to both of them
something very comparable You know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, yeah Like dude, I don't want this so
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know both of those fellas Yeah,
and it's just the Discord is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We act like asses in there sometime,
you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not afraid to admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fun because For five minutes And
that's what I love about this one because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why And and the reason I joined go
back to
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the the mat and the podcast and the
discord and everybody in there has been so
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful Helpful to me, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, could you before we keep going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you bring your Mic or whatever
you're picking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you for some reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear your voice coming through that
speaker a little bit or your speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: All I've got is my phone on speakerphone
Okay, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand you and everything It's
just I didn't know if you could get it a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a little bit better when you
lean closer but so Yeah Yes, we could be
[SPEAKER_02]: dickheads in the discord a little bit,
but I like to look at it is like Like a
[SPEAKER_02]: book it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we all we all cut up like brothers like
I don't know if people It's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: reminds me of working in a mechanic shop
or auto body shop Like if you can take
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of resin, you're gonna be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, don't get me wrong what I do
appreciate about the discord There's
[SPEAKER_01]: people like yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah, yeah, I mean that You know
When you got a bunch of guys and gals and
[SPEAKER_02]: discord that are really knowledgeable and
have been growing for 10 20 30 40 years
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you're gonna butt heads on
different opinions and things,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know And not to mention in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean right now everything's a little
crazy So and depending on your stance on
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff so but but something I love about
our community and and what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: do is just You know focus on the plants
Focus on you know learning focus on having
[SPEAKER_02]: a good time I mean if you're a person that
gets your feelings hurt pretty easily or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe Maybe you're you're made out tissue
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably shouldn't join the discord
said because Are you really looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: discord if you're that if you're that
soft?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not probably not but that also
being said that that kind of environment
[SPEAKER_02]: often kind of for us at least produces the
best People and that's what Matt's after
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt's after good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about people that You know are
the the got the most shit or the best cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: or the best growers all the time Yeah
Everybody will answer you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got the godfather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on Come on and one of the most humble
people and
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's the guy got the other day I
didn't he didn't ask for a penny for that
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean know what those cards are worth
and I'm still freaking out about Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah Yeah, he's uh, he sent me some seeds
he another guy a bitter H&L pock of course
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt And there's a lot of other guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably forgetting About but they've
helped me a lot, you know, and even though
[SPEAKER_02]: other people that we just hang out and
talk it's kind of it's it's a it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: community, you know, we all cut up and
hang out and I know you've met up with a
[SPEAKER_02]: few people probably and I've met a few up
with a few of these guys and met some of
[SPEAKER_02]: her real life and They're all they've all
been really great to me, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Well, that's one thing I really wanted
to propose to you and now we're on the
[SPEAKER_01]: spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly think this summer we And meet up
and I wonder something yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that's what I want to pass on to you
I want you and your message to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: asses up to Holland to see the cool Well

too far away from where you're at maybe an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour Yeah Well in a once-in-a-lifetime
experience because I know there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: shit going on there that you guys may have
to move, but you know Definitely try to
[SPEAKER_01]: get up if you're still wearing this thing
get your ass up to Holland I've been up
[SPEAKER_02]: there actually talking about with the

[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, but see that it's unreal and of
course, you can go buy some berries.

there last night thinking like about maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: like some kind of meetup of some kind,
you know I don't want to say anything In
[SPEAKER_02]: stone, but maybe as we go through I'm
gonna have guests on and maybe as we work
[SPEAKER_02]: to guess we'll start you know arranging
something figure out something for the
[SPEAKER_02]: summer because
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you can't travel with anything,
you know, we can go get it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary Sweet peach and we all come
with Yeah, we'll figure out a way well,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's other ways we can get we can get
shit there Y'all I'll rent a house or
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll do an Airbnb Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be fun because that last
summer I did that with the guys and I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that this summer I know there's a
couple meetups maybe happening at some
[SPEAKER_02]: point I don't know if I'm going but that
would be great to have something in my
[SPEAKER_02]: own, you know somewhere here in Michigan
There's close by a man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may and I'll bring bring There's a
lot of people that that the one fella has
[SPEAKER_01]: been talking with us a lot on the stages I
mean, I know he's right there
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, there's quite a few Oh,
yeah, that'd be great to get together like
[SPEAKER_02]: midsummer bring some smoke that we've all
harvested from stuff We've grown out and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Maybe I could ask you what's your
preferred way to smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like joints bongs vaporizers or
something else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that's your dab rig Yes,
sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm I'm I am the weirdest person on
the face planet that likes cannabis I've
[SPEAKER_01]: never liked it I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: You know quite a bit of around but I I
prefer Mine and I got to pack streets with
[SPEAKER_01]: the silicone the dasher I put it because
But yeah, I like it through the same rig
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I I did really I've never been a
fucking dab motherfucker really much but
[SPEAKER_02]: recently my friend he he showed me how to
do cold starts because Back when I learned
[SPEAKER_02]: about dabs growing up these motherfuckers
would torch this shit and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not me, bro And recently my buddy
he told me how to do cold starts and I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually really enjoy that I will say this

[SPEAKER_02]: have shit on a v-rip, dude I have to use a
v-rip last summer at the party bro in that
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was It depends on your temperature so
when you're doing cold you're kind of yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll put the booger on The bottom of
it and what the bottom I give it either
[SPEAKER_01]: the kind of one minute or three And when
it bubbles and I know it's not gonna be so
[SPEAKER_01]: harsh But you can back the truth at one to
three seconds Gives it to the point where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually still keep the curfew
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, you probably also giving yourself
throat cancer dude fucking fucking burn it
[SPEAKER_02]: my buddy I don't know that really but my

[SPEAKER_02]: Any Went through that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you said you're not much into the
breeding but If you could have a dream
[SPEAKER_02]: strain if you could create your own strain
What which ones would you what two plants
[SPEAKER_02]: would you cross together or if you can
have any cut maybe any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothetical I Wish I wish my bubblegum
process would have worked

[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, excuse me keep burping on the
Mets In that site, there's a picture
[SPEAKER_02]: called I'll put maybe I'll slice some of
these pictures in this video But there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: real pretty plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called turp Queen and dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some of those going I'm hoping to
get one of those purple ones like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big purple weed guy,
but that plant in particular I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wow, it's beautiful and something to be
said about all those dream Blue dream
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses is even at this tall bro six
inches if you break off up broke off a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple little leaves you can smell That
blue dream bro, and I know it because I've
[SPEAKER_02]: grown dryer sheets in the previous pock
mystery grow Like a year and a half ago or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that our year ago That was
the most that particular cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember drying in this tent I
cleaned the tent out and then I did a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole nother dry on a whole nother run
like three months later and that fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: tent still smelled like that dryer sheets
is the strain that or the Cross that it
[SPEAKER_02]: was But yeah, dude, just the blue dream is
awesome from pock, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it I I think he said he I don't I
think the s ones are sold out right now on
[SPEAKER_02]: that site But I think he said he's working
on getting some more up, but I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_02]: but Yeah, man If you had a dream grow
setup, what would you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that was 10 by 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can I say that is because I
would Five by five because then I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have a dedicated Not the bed, but then I
would do by fours on the side So you do a
[SPEAKER_01]: mom room you could do a corn You'd have
your individual fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be it because I don't
regularly like I mean So there's my
[SPEAKER_01]: gorilla there's my And then the the two by
right there so I mean I keep everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: here regulated by dehumidified But and
that's the mistake a lot of people know is
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've run your DC with a fire Don't
let it go into the track.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never gonna keep up with that trip
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can worry about it as much
right here well, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity is cut through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep Humidifier jumps into that five gallon
bucket and there's no way that's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: fill up by the time I get home Yeah Shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I'm about to rig my my drain for my
dehumidifier out the window, bro I'm tired
[SPEAKER_02]: of fucking even the five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so weary about about I got a
cheaper dehumidifier, bro And you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I could probably obviously you know check
check what's in it and shit like that but
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that shit for outside like I'll take
it out so like You know like plants
[SPEAKER_02]: outside or whatever and also We're we're
on a whale too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just dump it on the grounds going back
into the fucking Well at some point,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, well I have to worry about cow
mag Yeah, well actually you do here bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it's more iron and dissolved like
metals that are in the water so Yeah Right
[SPEAKER_02]: so back home bro, I didn't realize how
good I had it You know, there's been some
[SPEAKER_02]: people that will shit on Kentucky about
growing but the water and the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything for me Even in the winter
time was perfect never really got p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never really had pest problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing dude, but here bro The water is
different like there the water had tons of
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium and different different things in
it and I knew it you'd see it build up on
[SPEAKER_02]: your fish tanks and shit, you know,
whereas here it's iron and different
[SPEAKER_02]: metals you see it just building up and you
can smell it and so You know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people say well just you know,
I'm running like two to three hundred PPMs
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out the faucet So I I personally
don't know what's in it I know obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: you get up to like four or five hundred
your you can go all the way up to like
[SPEAKER_02]: four or five hundred to the point where
it's not safe to drink probably but hey
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just I want to start at a base level
with the RO that way I can put in even if
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to spend a little bit more money I
don't mind because I know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how you know exactly what my inputs
are And that's kind of where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a dream grow set up I would
probably have rooms but still like
[SPEAKER_02]: individual sealed rooms, but still have
tents but maybe bigger bigger rooms bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: tents, but just individual sealed rooms
cuz you know, I Don't know a big building
[SPEAKER_02]: outside like a big fucking warehouse or a
building would be great, dude What I know
[SPEAKER_01]: I can afford eventually and a 10 by 20
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up my damn self I'm gonna put in
either two by six walls or honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I might go as crazy as put in two by ten
miles because I'm building it once for me
[SPEAKER_01]: for my breath I put in two by twelve
floors with spray foam and put
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure-treated wood on the very bottom
with a regular plywood on the top because
[SPEAKER_01]: then you don't get to worry about that
this year and then spray foam the walls
[SPEAKER_01]: with two by ten miles dude you're gonna
look at it ours 35 or 40
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could have my next spot and I'll be
moving not not I'll be moving here pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: soon my next spot I want to find a Drain
on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it to be concrete with the drain on
the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to fucking sink right there I want
at least a few I got a few finally got a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple 55 gallon Reservoirs up here that
I'm gonna start I've just now I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking around with this RO system and I'm
dialing it in I'm dialing it in but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not where I want it to be just yet,
but I would have a big reservoir or a few
[SPEAKER_02]: and Yeah, man more power bro, that's
another thing more power bro, cuz you
[SPEAKER_02]: could never have enough fucking power.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you know and Preferably a
really nice Some kind of well that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be good enough A sink in a drain and in a
door, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the second floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So carrying soil and shit, dude It's a
fucking it's fun, bro I don't have a shed
[SPEAKER_01]: door My step door is great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know that was a major problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I Came across a freaking weapon for
my next my dad's next door neighbor for
[SPEAKER_01]: free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I'll take I mean I just put it on
the shed and It has made all the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in the world by airflow because
you're never gonna seal a shed door No,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can see behind me that white Is
really the stuff that you put under metal
[SPEAKER_01]: roofing on top of our computer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm getting double
insulation Great and I'm not paying too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a window unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of their sheds that had two
windows on it and a small heater,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as long as I run my life It stays
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's I mean dude redneck ingenuity
brother
[SPEAKER_01]: These days I can get a 3d printer and I
mean, I know I've talked to that nauseam
[SPEAKER_01]: on the discord But I want to make my
bucket system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know and you know it blue
match meets redneck basically Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's the individual blue mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's each bucket has it been read to be
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, I uh, we were maybe before I
forget I we were talking about grow dream
[SPEAKER_02]: grow rooms earlier I There's a point where
you get to where you got too many plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know you can always make it
better and More efficient but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: something I learned last year do just like
there's a limit where it becomes not fun
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore at least for me Yeah, and maybe
like maybe that would be too big if I
[SPEAKER_02]: could just have a nice little spot A room
or two that has a sink in a drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But uh enough power But yeah, I mean dude,
I'm like you bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I grew up poor shit so anytime I could
save a buck and if I got to put a A little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of work and some elbow grease into
something and to make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm gonna do it It's like those
drums.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were holding the brown rice syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I paid five bucks apiece for
each one Yeah, and I mean a brand new one
[SPEAKER_02]: with the lid is like $160 shipped to you
and I think at tractor supply they're like
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred bucks So I cut a hole in it with
the saws all bro, and they're both of them
[SPEAKER_02]: that's power washed them out You know put
some soap and bleach and stuff clean them
[SPEAKER_02]: all out real good and dude I got two 55
gallon reservoirs chilling up here for
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking ten bucks, bro I mean it took me
an hour to fuck with them
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's where redneck we
freaking somebody like bitter Guys you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, but you know That's where you take
the information from guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look up to like that or you know,
it's not like when I say look up to it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not like I'm God Right burning from them
and I'm happy to say that I'm learning
[SPEAKER_01]: from Through the process of oh shit read
that one up, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: And and if anybody joins the joy sports
and And you're in there in the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: with a gold name gives you any information
listen to it because One of this one here
[SPEAKER_01]: because we've proven that they deserve
that gold bank and if you join Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you know, that's well a good way
to put it dude I think Denali put it even
[SPEAKER_02]: better leave the egos in the mazola tub
No, no, I mean at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a ego driven Hobby, you know are
not ego driven, but there's a lot of ego a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of egos in this in this shit so I
could get why you don't like somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: thinks they know the best ways,
but I I'm like you dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be a sponge, dude I want to hear
what you got to say cuz hey, I mean maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll run into that problem like right now
I wish I would have listened about the
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfur when bitter was talking about it
the first 30 fucking times Then I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have had to write him and be like,
hey, how do you do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So do I need to dip my clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do this that that so?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you see these you're gonna giggle
because these have been mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna admit I am I'm the most generic
general hydroponic with I mean so my
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic Recharge and
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly God it is I know they talk about
a bunch of stuff until eight years down
[SPEAKER_01]: the road That that is bio available
because you get to the point where I know
[SPEAKER_01]: enough about plants and in growth
structures It's worth it because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: go from a stem that's that big around the
stem that's that damn big around it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, what was it something you
yield if you don't know if you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: share this But there was something that
yielded for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the blue dreams?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was insane Something crazy was crazy
and and so is the train wreck the train
[SPEAKER_01]: which was unreal but then Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if you've longed in this corner las
Okay, Tony, let me George all those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: come Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it's oh, yeah, that's myself bro,
I don't think I'm anywhere near the best
[SPEAKER_02]: grower or the most knowledgeable person if
anything I'm the opposite but and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: why I do the shit that I do in pursuit and
in in the discord because I want to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be around these guys like I mean
I remember being 15 16 17 years old
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking like watching some of these shows
and downloading some of these Pot times
[SPEAKER_02]: cups and shit and yeah, a lot of that shit
was crooked or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me as a Kentucky kid Like out on
an island by myself with nobody to look up
[SPEAKER_02]: to really or talk to about marijuana or
weed or whatever And not knowing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I didn't you know when you when
you're you don't know that everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking out to get you or it was a lot of
Scammers and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to be a part of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean to be honest I mean, I probably got
$4,000 worth of teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never damn grow right
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy said that that's every grower,
you know, I'm getting too much property My
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics in the very beginning and then
you start listening to Matt telling you
[SPEAKER_01]: the truth and it wasn't the fact that I
Was trying to prove a point the reason I
[SPEAKER_01]: liked Matt
[SPEAKER_01]: False information back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He instantly corrected himself and I'm not
saying it happened a bunch but Never got
[SPEAKER_01]: in the way of truly and I've Always
respected the hell out of that Right,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're going back to the what was
it the third episode of the podcast Matt
[SPEAKER_01]: was on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's pretty fun I never really what
I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched I watched a few Panels with CSI
years ago, dude on YouTube and literally I
[SPEAKER_02]: think I watched Maybe One episode it was
the episode of the origins of og cush or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the one on what they're talking
about from Florida or whatever and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just that was the one time I watched
something and then I literally saw Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: and not so talking about Some one of their
podcasts and I just started watching that
[SPEAKER_02]: so I got real lucky and didn't I mean I
don't get me wrong I brought my share of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit seeds, but a lot of things that I
bought were like your Crop kings in the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love marijuana shit like that You know
because I I was using Google because you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, you're thinking, you know,
we use Google for everything So you look
[SPEAKER_02]: first thing you do is you go on Google you
know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who best marijuana seeds in like the
fucking top?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three pages are like the dumbest shittiest
scammy like websites.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could you could think of right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever not, you know to give two props
to him But I mean like I said all the all
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that I bought from were faggots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sometimes And you know who I'm
talking about I'm not giving a new prop is
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big dude whether he's a good guy
or not He's got a bunch of asshole fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know That's the weed world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I learned and really
surprised me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I you know, I'm so appreciative of having
a living out my Sounds corny but being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to live my dream of hanging out with
other people who love weed as much as I do
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders Growers smokers just people enjoy
it But also, you know, I didn't know that
[SPEAKER_02]: there would be so much drama and stuff in
the weed world as well, too That kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: was like caught me off guard, but I don't
let that make my experience though either,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean thanks to the guys
thanks a thousand and Denali and Matt and
[SPEAKER_02]: And bitter not showing up actually to the
party I was able to go to on that fishing
[SPEAKER_02]: trip with Rob Clark and Denali and local
and Dan and and all those guys and and man
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a dream come true and I had to
pinch myself it sounds kind of fanboys cuz
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like I said The first time I ever
got a fucking autograph bro was yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Clark in this book.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was I Mean that would like that
would be like human and I know it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: happen I know it's gonna happen and I
don't give a shit if they take them and
[SPEAKER_01]: cards that I got and make them the value
that they are which I know what that Raven
[SPEAKER_01]: will do what they were worth What be to
sign those name cards?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want his signature on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't That matters to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how much I respect that you I want
to charge and I don't care It makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: worth two dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is worth the world to me And you
believe it my boy Already knows who being
[SPEAKER_01]: without ever being in the discourse Yeah,
and he knows because I talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody so so positively And he sees the
way I get like what after after our Friday
[SPEAKER_01]: night?
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube and when you do the stage now and
I'm still appreciate that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: stage every week dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's watched to you I mean made the profit
My boy sees the way that I tell me no,

sees the way that I'm going to listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: people that I look up to understand Yeah
Yeah, I mean dude Denali and a few other
[SPEAKER_02]: guys are I mean Denali specifically he
He's he's like my grandfather passed away
[SPEAKER_02]: like three four years ago, and he's
alcoholic and he we weren't super close,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the times that he was around were
really important and meaningful to me and
[SPEAKER_02]: Having D has been like having like almost
like another almost like a dad or a
[SPEAKER_02]: grandpa he's been so good to me and taught
me a lot of shit and Keeps me up keeps my
[SPEAKER_02]: stick on ice keeps me on a straight narrow
path for a lot You know, I get a little
[SPEAKER_02]: wild sometimes but uh, you know and as far
as the voice chats that we do after the
[SPEAKER_02]: show Yeah, I mean dude I could be doing
other shit, but I know that that means
[SPEAKER_02]: something to you guys and it's not about
me It's it's just bringing Sometimes the
[SPEAKER_02]: community sometimes we need people to just
be that first person to get something
[SPEAKER_02]: going and then you know other people join
and we all have a good time because it is
[SPEAKER_02]: it's awkward getting on the internet
especially sharing some people are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this still in the gray area of League
always so Yeah, I get how it's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But um, yeah just getting on there And I
don't know how many people want to listen
[SPEAKER_02]: to my dumbass talk But I get on there and
haven't cutting up with you guys and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know sharing stories and getting to know
you guys Believe it or not has been one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the better and surprising things that I've
enjoyed about the discord for sure,
[SPEAKER_02]: man Hey, that's what I wanted to do man
not Joe Rogan, but I wanted to just have a
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast or a show that was more Yeah,
just chill dude and just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about different Yeah,
and feel very honored that you asked me to
[SPEAKER_02]: be on here, I mean it means that the world
Well, yeah, I was gonna say that You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you were the first person I talked to Matt
about doing it in one of these little side
[SPEAKER_02]: shows or and I don't know how often I'll
do them But maybe once a month,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe twice a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see I had a lot of fun doing this
one, but my my thing I was gonna say was
[SPEAKER_02]: you were the first person that came to my
mind There's there's tons of other people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are just deserving and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let me get it Fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to bring on as many people as we
can from the discord and highlight
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody But you came to mine first
because you're one of the people that I
[SPEAKER_02]: see you always have a positive attitude
You're growing the stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not that you I don't think anybody
should have to grow stuff that they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to grow or no one's making you grow
shit in the discord, but It's awesome that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing the guys That we support
and that we rock with and also your
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude about everything to you You're
always got a positive spirit and I knew
[SPEAKER_02]: you would be a great guest to do and plus
your dude We're both thread next man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta gotta gotta gotta get a redneck on I
was gonna say you got the breeder

dude There's no falsehood that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm doing a good job, I mean And that
was my first interaction with me is when I
[SPEAKER_01]: first came on the discord, I think I had
the sister wifey In there all three of the
[SPEAKER_01]: trains that I'm gonna mention are gonna be
CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I miss your wifey Going back now sister
wifey was 1000 Wi-Fi and the three queens
[SPEAKER_01]: was And it was my third ever in their
group Denali said I was doing a good And
[SPEAKER_01]: now that I know it's deep more but you
know when you're first in there That you
[SPEAKER_01]: look, you know Up the tears and you've
given it felt really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that I know it's a lot more to me
Yeah, D's the OG man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean D has been doing it for a long time
D's kind of like the godfather discord and
[SPEAKER_02]: usually he people don't know this but a
lot of times when somebody new joins he'll
[SPEAKER_02]: reach out to him and kind of You know talk
to him and shit He takes care of
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the same thing For me and you know,
a lot of those guys have taken good care
[SPEAKER_02]: of me and I can't tell you how much I'm
appreciative of them and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's why I want to do the show to
add value to match channel and the breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate because you know, I think this
is this what we do in our discord I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that other discords aren't doing it
right either or whatever But you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: we do and focus on in our discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means the world to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, we can highlight that and put
that on A platform to where other people
[SPEAKER_02]: can see it and enjoy it and learn from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a win-win, dude And there's
not a guy on the discord and I don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've mentioned some of them like
look and and and Kristen and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys and And of course pack and high and
lose them
[SPEAKER_01]: and the that
[SPEAKER_01]: the right
[SPEAKER_01]: the And that's the one thing about the
discourse that I don't get mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: enough everybody loves And I'm not trying
to get you about it But everybody keeps a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit about throwing it whether it's no for
whatever motive it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not looking at a You know,
I've mentioned many
[SPEAKER_01]: But It's nice to see people that give us
about We're doing this for And the people
[SPEAKER_02]: close to us, yeah Yeah, I can't agree I
couldn't agree more, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going on I think It'll be like two
and a half years in a couple months in the
[SPEAKER_02]: discord, dude And it's been the best thing
that's ever happened to me as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: growing is concerned and just knowledge
and you know, I'm not the most
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledgeable person when it comes to
history or strains or cultivars things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, but I do that's why I'm here
just to learn and enjoy Weed and to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: with guys like you or girls, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out peaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out miss Jill No, but but you know
just share share knowledge and have fun
[SPEAKER_02]: and hang out and you know Some I talked to
you guys more than I talked to some of my
[SPEAKER_02]: childhood friends that I know for going on
30 plus years now, I feel some of them so
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so but in all honesty And the
reason I think that I have so much more in
[SPEAKER_01]: the discourse Especially when I get a
couple minutes at work, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's may not be patients there today or
I'm in between patients and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you take a breath of fresh air and You
was being talked about if I can have my
[SPEAKER_01]: two cents, I have my two cents and they
come up and a dad joke I mean 51 damn
[SPEAKER_01]: years old one of the older guys,
you know And you know It's just awesome to
[SPEAKER_01]: feel welcome and not only that,
you know, you're going to a place that
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's like me like I said Hardless
of the political view and that's one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I like about the discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get too political right,
you know and And that's that's one thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate you know, there's some guys in
there that are very opinionated And and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's fun Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean dude, I mean, yeah, I mean the
discord is You can't for five bucks,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean so nowadays that's like a fucking
Coffee or a piece of gum or pack of gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's it's bumpy Yeah, I mean,
I wish there was I wish there was a way
[SPEAKER_01]: That it would be more public on YouTube
Obviously not
[SPEAKER_01]: Controversy People are following the shit
out of them because they can say the right
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but that's one thing I wish about
about readers indicate It's never stooped
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those if you know,
you know, and it's like, you know when
[SPEAKER_01]: people ask about If I'm perfectly honest
with you, I know he's part of the city But
[SPEAKER_01]: if I were to tell a new brand new broke
the first place I'm gonna website it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be the first one because if you
can't pick
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, see us as the goat dude,
I mean I mean I know he's can illuminati
[SPEAKER_01]: and But when you're talking about
something that can bring somebody into the
[SPEAKER_01]: discourse, that's the guy I would send
them here.
