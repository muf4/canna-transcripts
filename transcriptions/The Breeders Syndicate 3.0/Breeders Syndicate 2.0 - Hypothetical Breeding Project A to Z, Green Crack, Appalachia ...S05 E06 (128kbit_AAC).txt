[SPEAKER_00]: Recomment How about them recumbent
genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: She kills me What's up everyone welcome
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasabi are you doing good?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you look tired.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do don't I?
[SPEAKER_05]: They are I think this light is not the
most flattering either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to change the dynamic That's
a little better maybe not You're right you
[SPEAKER_02]: just look like you've been punched in the
eye sockets a few times I did get up
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty early today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah early for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for sure early for me Yeah early for
you All right, so tonight I was thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about maybe we could talk about a Breeding
a to Z but in the form of like maybe I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: give you A set of traits and that I want
out of an end goal So just teaching people
[SPEAKER_02]: to start using goals and breeding right
give you traits for an end goal
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetical end goal and you build it
with In your in your hypothetical toolbox
[SPEAKER_02]: what what have you and you talk about?
[SPEAKER_02]: The ways you would go about this project
and then vice the verse you can give me
[SPEAKER_02]: some surprise Traits, and then I'll do
that with a feminized version of whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: you give me You sound like you're
underwater today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the deal is Is this is
it coming clear for everyone or just you I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know Maybe we get to ask who's
fucking on right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you guys hear him super clear as he
muffled?
[SPEAKER_02]: How we sound in testing testing one Two
three, I didn't use the cool microphone
[SPEAKER_02]: and shit this round because I thought it
was just not doing anything different But
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe that's why Okay Well, maybe it's
just me so I'll suffer you suffer through
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll suffer through it Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm gonna so basically it's like
one of the maybe I'll throw like my spiel
[SPEAKER_05]: on it or whatever but For a minute there
Probably the last five to seven years,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially there was like this explosion
of seed making right and You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've talked amongst about it's probably
like maybe even to the point where like
[SPEAKER_05]: 90% of the current people selling seeds
started in that era Yeah, right and so in
[SPEAKER_05]: that time like there was this big
explosion of monetary value and all that
[SPEAKER_05]: and so The that that economics changed how
people bred Yeah a lot not everyone but
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly a lot of people right and like
what used to be like side projects You
[SPEAKER_05]: know that were that could take some time
or have goals ended up being like mashing
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of famous things together Yeah,
not that there's anything wrong with that,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it just changed the dynamic of like,
you know a lot of multi-stage breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of went like to the wayside Yeah,
I sure did you sure did right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we're talking about this
evening is sort of like, you know I mean I
[SPEAKER_05]: guess you can get lucky and just knock it
out of the park one step but for the most
[SPEAKER_05]: part like it would be a multi-stage
process to get to where You want yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean over several years over several
several years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to knock it out of the
park Consistently all the time unless
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing certain kinds of fem breeding
of known clone to known clone,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, but yeah Yeah, you know and so,
you know One of the benefits of like
[SPEAKER_05]: what's happening right now in the
community might be that like the people
[SPEAKER_05]: that do decide to keep breeding People are
into like longer projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah You know and so it used to be there
was a minute there where people Would be
[SPEAKER_05]: like well, you can't get skittles and you
can't get chem 91, but if I make a hybrid,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe you'll buy that yeah, right and so
rather than like Skittles has these things
[SPEAKER_05]: that I want and so does chem 91 and is
there a way I can blend these two things
[SPEAKER_05]: and Eventually end up with this plant that
has the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right I mean that that's still like
If I can blend these two things I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: that's still an end goal if you have an
end goal of what you think they might end
[SPEAKER_02]: up at in the end But that's still kind of
like the process the beginning process of
[SPEAKER_02]: making crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a plant a plant B I want
the best of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what happens, you know,
but having an end goal We're like I want
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant to end up like this for this
environment for this this XYZ is super
[SPEAKER_05]: Detailed, you know, yeah Well,
I mean it depends on how similar you want
[SPEAKER_05]: them to be like you might only care about
Like for instance a couple of the traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah that you're trying to combine and not
Need it to be like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I obviously like the more things you're
trying to achieve the more the more
[SPEAKER_05]: difficult it becomes Yeah, but if you know
a simple way to think about it would be
[SPEAKER_05]: like what if I want to combine the Terps
from this plant with the potency of this
[SPEAKER_05]: other one Yeah, then you're only searching
for two things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can be defined by your goals,
too Yeah, right in that in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think about it so differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think that like to me that I
don't consider that Its goal But it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm necessarily referring to when I
say goals sure Because one one is I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: predicting I want an outcome desired
outcome and I'm picking many I'm picking
[SPEAKER_02]: from my library to make that outcome
happen and the other is still I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: hit these together and try to get the best
out of what results Based on what I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying one is more legitimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that like There you know
there it's like a little bit different to
[SPEAKER_05]: try to create like a line that has certain
traits Yeah, and what I'm gonna ask you to
[SPEAKER_02]: do is gonna be the hard one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gonna be the hard one The hard one,
you know, and then and then on top of that
[SPEAKER_05]: too, like, you know It's kind of
interesting but like if you have breeders
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt's one, you know Like that have been
at it for a long time and that keep
[SPEAKER_05]: certain plants around quite a long time
Right, like our buddy Caleb or flight or
[SPEAKER_05]: whoever, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: What they get to do is the more you breed
you actually get to start to see which
[SPEAKER_05]: traits of the plants That you breed with
follow up in the kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because there's some really amazing
cuts out there That suck is breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, very nice So like the individual cut
itself is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great smoke and all that but it's not
a stable or a solid thing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then there's other things that just
seem to breed true for certain
[SPEAKER_05]: characteristics almost no matter what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot that are just shit
growers that people normally wouldn't keep
[SPEAKER_02]: but our amazing breeders And don't breed
for the traits they visually express
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody just said yes turpentine is very
hard to breed out Yeah, once once it's in
[SPEAKER_05]: there Boy, it's really difficult finding
what you want without it in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really dominates Yeah, it does if she
throws her weight around you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's interesting too because there's
aspects where it's like Since I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_05]: the hard one You know what used to be
fucked up about breeding especially if it
[SPEAKER_05]: took multi-stage is That you have to make
sure that you save seeds from every stage
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because you can totally fuck up a
line and do something that you didn't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to do and it's a real bummer And if you
don't have a way to go back one generation
[SPEAKER_05]: and go in a different direction,
then you're just stuck with that mistake
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely and and I don't think
most people when they think about breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: realize that they would ever have to go
back a generation I don't think that even
[SPEAKER_02]: comes into the equation in their in their
minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it didn't when I was young.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Yeah, I mean it can be Most most of our
friends wish they had there's at least one
[SPEAKER_05]: project They did that they really like
that They feel like they fucked up a bit
[SPEAKER_05]: along the way and they wish they could go
back and redo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, yeah, so He feels like DJ
did that DJ stuff is DJ stuff is his own
[SPEAKER_05]: story in itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unique But you know, I mean there's
an aspect of like different people have
[SPEAKER_05]: worked his stuff in different directions
at different times.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's given It over to seed companies and
then get gotten back seed stock So it
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely is like what era you got it
from it could vary quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's so Yeah, you know,
so, you know, but yeah I mean there's
[SPEAKER_05]: there's an aspect of like I think for like
most hobby breeders really having some
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of goal is Is probably good,
you know, cuz I tell people all the time
[SPEAKER_05]: like the most important thing of what
you're doing Is that like you're happy
[SPEAKER_05]: with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right in the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's That's it Well, yeah, I mean we for
a lot for a long time we bred we just
[SPEAKER_05]: tried to breed weed that we like to smoke
Yeah, because it was it was long enough
[SPEAKER_05]: ago that like we just never really felt
like any kind of seed company was was even
[SPEAKER_02]: realistic Yeah, I never thought ever about
getting a famous seed company ever in the
[SPEAKER_05]: history of my company Yeah, I mean when we
were when we were breeding in the in the
[SPEAKER_05]: 90s and early 2000s and stuff like that
like the people that started seed
[SPEAKER_05]: companies back Then literally still went
to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you had to go there to make it big
So it was like a massive life shit like it
[SPEAKER_05]: was, you know, so a lot of us we just bred
we just bred for ourselves Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know now it's cool with Instagram,
you know and all these different various
[SPEAKER_05]: platforms You can do some a lot of people
can do small breeding and then offer it up
[SPEAKER_05]: and reach people Yeah, and so there's this
commercialism aspect that was like hard
[SPEAKER_05]: before so like before a lot of times
people were trying to just please
[SPEAKER_05]: Themselves or their buddies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's more like please the public
Which is fine and there there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain era to where it wasn't even just
pleased the public It was a much smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd and it was pleased the forum crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah tiny era of well,
it may not be what I like but it's what
[SPEAKER_02]: sells on the forums and even that is a
Vast difference from what sells on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram now, you know, so I think I
remember those I remember those eras and
[SPEAKER_05]: What was hot and like the pressure to
breed with all that work because it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: people want it and I mean I you know We
there's even posts from Neville when he
[SPEAKER_05]: was when he was posting in like 2009 or 10
that even in the 80s and early 90s He
[SPEAKER_05]: would get shit for everybody would be
like, oh, I want the purest indica
[SPEAKER_05]: imaginable Yeah, he'd release something
that was like that and then they would
[SPEAKER_05]: suffer and yield and he would get endless
bitching Yeah, so there's always been a
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial aspect of it, you know and then
you end up having to Like you end up
[SPEAKER_05]: having to please people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in some ways All my friends anybody
that breeds for non-commercial purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just get to do whatever the fuck you
want Well in this case, you're gonna do
[SPEAKER_02]: what the customer wants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here we go So this is a rather picky
customer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that obviously has to work
in the modern market since this is 2022
[SPEAKER_02]: they want something with eight weeks
flowering They don't want none of that
[SPEAKER_02]: long flowering shit that you love they
want eight weeks flowering They want a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of purple right a little bit of
purple The most important thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're missing in their arsenal is black
licorice mixed with gas They want they
[SPEAKER_02]: want some gassy back end on it and black
licorice and like I said modern market and
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want any og or cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man So where do we start?
[SPEAKER_05]: So right there right that makes it every
everybody just heard like they want like
[SPEAKER_05]: six different things Yes in the same line
so that everything you add Make
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially makes it harder or longer of a
search to try to figure it out Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: or you have to get luckier to find it
quick or you have to have a large library
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're very familiar with You know
that helps too because obviously like if
[SPEAKER_05]: you know how your plants breed that could
narrow It down a bunch that would be
[SPEAKER_05]: helpful like for me, but if you were just
trying to smash plants together to find
[SPEAKER_05]: that Aspect it would probably be pretty
rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and so basically what they want is
something that's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want quick purple They want good
turps Frosty frosty is shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh My god, it's a modern market.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need something that washes they need
something that washes No og either not
[SPEAKER_02]: just cookies no og No og and they're
trying to turn that corner like burners
[SPEAKER_05]: doing and they wanted to be feminized or
regular No, you're doing regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god You're gonna do the same for me
in reverse with feminized and you can pick
[SPEAKER_02]: the traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah He just said here we go he just
fucked me um, so the hard part obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: is that okay, so just break it down Right
you need something you need something
[SPEAKER_05]: frosty Terpy fairly attractive you need it
to come in relatively quickly and The the
[SPEAKER_05]: hardest one out of all that is probably
like the black licorice turps Because
[SPEAKER_05]: that's pretty specific and fucking rare
And then the other part of it that sucks,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know is that it has to be a regular
seed line Yeah So in that in that regard
[SPEAKER_02]: what you would have to do is you would It
can't be several it can be a multi-step
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean so that's what I'm
saying is like you would end up You know
[SPEAKER_05]: one of your first steps probably would be
like you would have to figure out what
[SPEAKER_05]: what kind of male you wanted to use and
then you would cross it to you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the One of the females that you want to
use and start there and then you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: male female blend inly because now at
first you need a pollen source Yes,
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of the attractiveness of
fucking Everybody like doing feminizes
[SPEAKER_05]: because they can create their own pollen
source and they knew pretty much what
[SPEAKER_02]: traits were gonna probably Pass because
they could smell their pollen source and
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, so there's so there's basically
there's a way to where it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Once you once you and that's
where all like the BX or BC is people
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about like that's where it started
Yeah is people needed a pollen donor to
[SPEAKER_05]: start working on their line idea Yeah,
and then they could start playing with it
[SPEAKER_05]: once They had pollen they could make
pollen every generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah is really what it boils down to so
Realistically speaking probably what I
[SPEAKER_05]: would end up doing is that My buddy is
throwing me off by answering but what I
[SPEAKER_05]: would probably do is I would cheat and I
would My buddy that just made me laugh him
[SPEAKER_05]: and I made some a bunch of hybrids with
some old maple leaf Indica seeds from the
[SPEAKER_05]: early 2000s right and one of the things
that they we did is we crossed it to the
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendo P Okay, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Mendo P has some color.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got crazy turps It doesn't wash that
well or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the very least It's something old
and basic that you could start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right so You know one of the things
you need to start with is like an idea of
[SPEAKER_05]: how you're gonna start and how you're
gonna finish Yes, right because whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: you finish with The cross is 50% back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you know And so you're starting that
you're starting and your ending is 50 50
[SPEAKER_05]: and in the middle you get to play.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so And it's not potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, that's the thing is you're
starting with limitations We don't we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't need it I don't believe potency was
a part of it because in today's market you
[SPEAKER_02]: can wash it and everything's potent So
potent's not a part of the equation So
[SPEAKER_05]: probably what I would do is I would take
that maple leaf Indica by Mendo perps,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would grow it out and I would pick a
male probably one that leaned like in leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: structure and all that and especially one
that turned colors on its male flowers and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff and I would probably pick the most
Mendo perp leaning Mail I possibly could
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, which it should be relatively easy
because the maple doesn't turn colors and
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaf structure is way different,
right and and Mendo P kicks certain kinds
[SPEAKER_05]: of turps, doesn't it and Mendo P kicks
certain kinds of turps?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Well, the other two is that it's like a
basic Indica that I started with and then
[SPEAKER_05]: you cross it to something extremely unique
So hopefully you can pick out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: that unique Right in your mail,
which makes it a lot easier than if it was
[SPEAKER_05]: like two similar things Yeah, so take some
pollen of that and I would probably throw
[SPEAKER_05]: it on Something like the snow Yeah,
well the reason is is that when I was
[SPEAKER_05]: doing that project down south,
you know, I got to run a lot of Caleb's
[SPEAKER_05]: gear Yeah, and I probably ran half a dozen
snow hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and the shit just consistently kicks
nice Pretty colas covered in frost it
[SPEAKER_05]: shortens up the the flower time and all
that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah You know the Mendo perps would
bring some color and some turps the snow
[SPEAKER_05]: would bring Structure and crystal and like
a nice look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good that's a good choice I
like and I've seen it and I've seen it
[SPEAKER_05]: work consistently on a bunch of hybrids
already Yeah, throw that kind of traits
[SPEAKER_05]: through a bunch of different crosses that
I like So the chance that it could do that
[SPEAKER_05]: in this one is probably reasonably high I
think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So boom now I have a snow by by maple by
purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right so you Grow up that now it's
more complicated because you're looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for traits So now probably what you're
doing is because you're it's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_05]: as easy to visually pick it out It would
probably get shitty and you'd probably end
[SPEAKER_05]: up picking like three of the nicest males
you could find Yeah, and separately
[SPEAKER_05]: pollinating like the female of your choice
Yeah, then you grow them all out and you
[SPEAKER_05]: see which which of those three hopefully
passed the most traits that you were
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for because there's An aspect with
males where you're like really not gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, so the wider male pool you
use the the better Yeah, but you can
[SPEAKER_02]: isolate it and see which one goes to it
Yeah, for the sake of this argument not to
[SPEAKER_05]: get like crazy esoteric and stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just say three triplets Yeah,
you know and so now I have a snow Mendo P
[SPEAKER_05]: maple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, right and So I take a male of that
Are three males of that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm, and I hit it to I hit it each
separately to my Maui Because the Maui is
[SPEAKER_05]: in the Maui.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the Maui turns purple in the cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super frosty It's got chunks all over
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you've got a quick maple a quick
Mendo P a quick Maui You know the snows
[SPEAKER_05]: reasonably quick so you all of a sudden
you start upping your chances that like A
[SPEAKER_05]: fino that you want is gonna be in that
That 50 to 60 day range of what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going for I guess right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know And since the Maui turns a
little purple and the Mendo P is purple
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have a lot of purple in there
But you have some definitely and you can
[SPEAKER_05]: start looking for it and the the snow and
the Maui end up having like You know the
[SPEAKER_05]: structure and the frost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so then I would hunt through that
But that's let's see so maple onto them
[SPEAKER_05]: Maple onto them under the Mendo P. That's
one stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right and then that onto the snow
that's two stages and then a Mail out of
[SPEAKER_05]: that onto the Maui You're already at three
stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah You know, and where's your gas coming
in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's my gas coming in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, you know, the gas is gonna be hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think because I think right there you
probably have your your Wait, you said gas
[SPEAKER_05]: and Yes gas and licorice gas and licorice
rock dude, that's fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna have to do this What if I
just take one?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna pick one and you're gonna
have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Okay, so now we have Now we have a
like what is it like it's like a four-way
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrid now it's like maple maple started
the pollen maple Mendo and Snow and Maui.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so if we wanted if we wanted now,
it's gonna be 50% of the cross,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a bunch of early shit a bunch
of frosty shit a couple purple things if I
[SPEAKER_05]: really wanted to jack up the purple and
The licorice I only have one thing I could
[SPEAKER_05]: do I could put it on the anus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes But then that would be but then I
would be that would be fucked because then
[SPEAKER_05]: there were dead the chance that you would
also get gas Would be kind of hard The
[SPEAKER_05]: anus and the anus these star unknowns,
you know, because black liquor is really
[SPEAKER_05]: hard So I don't think to be perfectly
honest anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going for gas anymore We're just
dropping that going for all black licorice
[SPEAKER_05]: and modern people are talking about Yeager
that the anus is actually extremely close
[SPEAKER_05]: to the Yeager the fit Oh somebody who said
the fishermen who the fuck just said the
[SPEAKER_02]: fishermen That's why what's that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: So my buddy My buddy and I we used to grow
a bunch of anus Together and he used to
[SPEAKER_05]: take it down to the bay and give it to
certain crews, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was a professional tuner fisherman
Yeah, so they used to call they used to
[SPEAKER_05]: call when we sold them that we they used
to call it the the fishermen Nice because
[SPEAKER_05]: my buddy's nickname was actually tuna
Tuna.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, was he in the movie blow?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he was not in the movie blow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he but yeah, I mean he's he's actually
like You know, he's actually a big part of
[SPEAKER_05]: that stuff story really But yeah the the
fisherman he That was probably back in oh
[SPEAKER_05]: six or something like that So just so
people know right like I didn't even talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about like you could get really lucky in
what I described and you could do it all
[SPEAKER_05]: and in that many steps Or you could grow
shit out and realize it's not at all what
[SPEAKER_05]: you want and want to go back a step Yeah,
that's like a best-case scenario right
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that definitely is a best-case
scenario, you know because that that's
[SPEAKER_05]: assuming that like each stage And then you
could talk for a little bit about like
[SPEAKER_05]: well how many?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah You know because every cross you have
a female is the certainty Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: but does the male pass what you want of
the hybrid?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I always call it the shotgun
method.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you called it the shotgun method and
it's right but like what they people used
[SPEAKER_05]: to do in the old days is they would They
would cross like their three every stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would cross their three favorite
males yeah to the same female and Mark
[SPEAKER_05]: them different and then when you grow them
out You look yeah, and whatever one gave
[SPEAKER_05]: you the best females You picked males from
that that donation You know what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: saying yeah, you know because you were
because that that was the way that we
[SPEAKER_05]: tested back then if you just did one male
you're just hoping Three isn't even all
[SPEAKER_05]: that great, but it's like let's be
reasonable about people's ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually do shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know yeah, yeah, so You know and then
you know It doesn't I mean it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_05]: to be huge it just depends on everybody's
size it depends on what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: do You know 50 or 100 seeds held back is
probably plenty for most people's purposes
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know stick with and then you'd
probably and then you put right there
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd probably have a situation that would
be there would be plenty of purple plants
[SPEAKER_05]: There would be a lot of frosty and
visually attractive plants the licorice
[SPEAKER_05]: would be in there But what might be a
little harder to find you know and the gas
[SPEAKER_05]: we'd have to do one more stage to
something yeah to get lucky and They asked
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're naming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's gonna probably call the
obvious the purple annus is the purple
[SPEAKER_05]: annus But but that's how I mean in a sense
like you know when when we were planning
[SPEAKER_05]: the superdog project it was like we We
were trying to get the the the looks and
[SPEAKER_05]: the greenery and the smell of the skunk
Combined with like the density and the and
[SPEAKER_05]: the power of the chem dog yeah You know
and so what Matt just gave me was he just
[SPEAKER_05]: gave me like what was it a five or six
requirements It was it was several yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that makes it a real pain purple
black licorice gas eight weeks flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: Works in the modern market, so that's
that's like five five.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's yes It's half a dozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's half a dozen different things so that
makes it more difficult Yes, if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: only looking to combine a couple of traits
from from one cross then You can do what
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna do with Matt and you can do easy
and you can cheat and you not do don't
[SPEAKER_05]: even need a mail Yeah, you know,
but that's how everybody used to start
[SPEAKER_05]: things and then the traditional way Which
is like what got done to maybe like the
[SPEAKER_05]: c99 and other shit was that people would
now it's BC But back then it was BX people
[SPEAKER_05]: would just repeatedly cross males of a
hybrid to the same clone Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: one two three four times basically trying
to get an inbred Plant that was as close
[SPEAKER_02]: to the mother clone as they could yeah,
and because of that that explanation of
[SPEAKER_02]: c99 and there and and that long
explanation of how it was achieved and
[SPEAKER_02]: blah blah blah people have consistently
even myself I was trying to do px3s for
[SPEAKER_02]: years and finding that like I'm ending up
with way more bullshit than I started with
[SPEAKER_02]: why does this look like an f2 as opposed
to a Bx3 this should be locking in stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: not going way further away from it and It
just doesn't Sometimes things work great
[SPEAKER_02]: in theory in other plants that don't
necessarily apply as well in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's so variant and A lot of
people don't understand that because of
[SPEAKER_02]: c99 that the miss info given with c99
Yeah, and I mean people just think that
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know when you're BX and it's
like you'd probably need a pretty big
[SPEAKER_05]: population and then there's a reason why
They call it inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, it really takes big
populations to avoid that And so most
[SPEAKER_05]: people are doing hobby shit, you know,
and so what you just you know is like
[SPEAKER_05]: there's an aspect of like trying to You
know, it's like I always think of like
[SPEAKER_05]: what Neville's criteria was for his nl5
hazes Yeah, right is he didn't want
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that went over 16 weeks because
he thought that was way too fucking long
[SPEAKER_05]: and he wanted the potency and He wanted
nice enough buds and enough yield that it
[SPEAKER_05]: was worth going the four months it took
and it had to grow and grow Down a grow
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan Rockwell on the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean they and that's all
they used or whatever So that was that was
[SPEAKER_05]: the aspect but that's not he didn't really
actually breathe for turps He didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: breathe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't add in a bunch of extra shit He
was going for weight potency and it
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't take 22 weeks, you know,
like a lot of the hazes were so You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: he only picked really three things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know And you know, we just
picked five or six.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just goes to show that like don't
don't get discouraged, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: try to try to pick a reasonable a
reasonable blend and it's always easier if
[SPEAKER_05]: like if Matt hadn't given me like the The
licorice thing was a super bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like if because it really limits
there's only a few things that have it
[SPEAKER_05]: Cinnamon I would have just thrown my hands
up and been like what the fuck,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Yeah, I mean cuz you can get too
specific but I mean obviously there's
[SPEAKER_05]: there's scents like gas or like turpentine
or like citrus or whatever that Occur
[SPEAKER_05]: commonly enough in cannabis that you'd
have a bunch of pads to pick where you
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to get that turp from Yeah,
the turp that Matt picked was hella
[SPEAKER_05]: limiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you really are like grasping at straws
There are some good ones I thought of that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could have come up with it would have
covered all the bases I might have missed
[SPEAKER_05]: it, you know, it's hard to think off the
top of your head Oh my god a four or five
[SPEAKER_05]: stage project that requires a real male
because you know 20 years ago all Your
[SPEAKER_05]: buddy seeds it was like everything you had
in your collection had regular males in it
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and now most might not all of it,
but there's a good chunk of my shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's feminized Yes, so that's all I
don't want to say it's useless,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's like it for this particular
fucking thing It's like not very helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, how many people make reg seeds right
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you could have done a fem female
with a male Fem line female so I could
[SPEAKER_05]: have yeah I mean there's probably and
that's the cool part right is that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: Like sometimes past your goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like what you have access to yeah,
like the chem D LA Kush was one I was
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking of specifically for yeah,
maybe some some turps like Gas and black
[SPEAKER_02]: licorice, but it's not necessarily purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I actually missed that I didn't
realize that until a whole bunch of people
[SPEAKER_05]: started popping that hybrid the LA by D
Yeah, and and there's a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_05]: that got gas and headband aromas and all
that like I was expecting But I would say
[SPEAKER_05]: there's been a few dozen people at least
That have talked about anus turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they got the anus They got the anus
which was really interesting that you know
[SPEAKER_05]: to have that pop up Yeah, you know even
occasionally or whatever You know and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, I you know, I went on a mission a
while a little while ago And I brought
[SPEAKER_05]: back all those seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and my buddy just never never did
the fem So remember I was reading him do
[SPEAKER_05]: the other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's like a hodge because it's
like what males?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he have when and what was he using to
blend with what you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something I've noticed with like a
lot of Mendo breeding and a lot of like
[SPEAKER_02]: the old-school breeding As opposed to like
like with my mindset It's like I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: use something very very very basic like
almost as close to the land races I can or
[SPEAKER_02]: something very as stable as possible,
you know typically On the mainland,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I'm not seeing a lot of variation So I
know where I'm going whereas back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day it looks like they would do That
single stage cross the polyhybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: polyhybrid polyhybrid polyhybrid
polyhybrid polyhybrid even back then like
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just how it was done It was yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean there was a lot of like what I call
hill weed Where people would when they sex
[SPEAKER_05]: their plants their males would stay in
five or ten gallon pots off downwind in
[SPEAKER_05]: the wood somewhere Yeah, right and then
when they wanted to make fresh seed every
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of years or whatever They would
wait and they would go collect pollen from
[SPEAKER_05]: all their saved males and blend it
together Right and then they'd walk up to
[SPEAKER_05]: their patch and their two or three
favorite females that year They would take
[SPEAKER_05]: a paintbrush or whatever and they would
brush the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah of those plants and mark them So then
they're taking a blend of like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, whatever it is six or twelve or
fifteen boys Yeah, blending it together
[SPEAKER_05]: and then adding it to like the three or
four sweetest females.
[SPEAKER_05]: They saw from the line Yeah, and you do
that for ten or fifteen years and then you
[SPEAKER_05]: have You have a bunch of kind of unique
hill shit Yeah, you know it was like it
[SPEAKER_05]: was read relatively diverse and they
wouldn't do it every year Most people
[SPEAKER_05]: would just try to make fresh seed stock
every two or three sometimes some people
[SPEAKER_05]: were nerding out and doing it all the time
and Some people like seeds was like the
[SPEAKER_05]: only thing that they knew about so they
just tried to freshen them up every other
[SPEAKER_02]: season or so You know, it sounds like I'm
talking down on it But I actually like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the kind of stuff I hunt like if I
hear about someone having old hill weed
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds on something I'm like I don't know
why but it's always the most appealing to
[SPEAKER_05]: me for some reason It's also from an era
where there was a whole bunch of diversity
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it was before like the same 45
clones get blended together in innumerable
[SPEAKER_05]: ways Yeah, so even just going back that
far opens up the gene pool in a way I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean, that's kind of why when I said like,
you know what my buddy that I made those
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds with or whatever He breeds seeds
every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, he's got stuff going back.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got all kinds Of odd stuff,
you know, I'm sure people would love to
[SPEAKER_05]: hear it But he but you know, he breeds for
him or whatever and so he had these,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Roughly 20 year old like,
you know, probably from like right around
[SPEAKER_05]: when sensei was starting to go south Yeah,
he has these maple seeds and they were you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, we crossed them to we actually we
actually grew a bunch of them out in Five
[SPEAKER_05]: six years ago the Mendo perps maple.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some really pretty pictures of
them, but they burned Damn they burned,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so they got all the way to like
October 9th and then and then they went to
[SPEAKER_05]: shit, you know But that's kind of how you
have to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you have to like figure out
where you're gonna get it from and For me
[SPEAKER_05]: it was a little easier because most of the
plants I've mentioned I've had for a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time Yeah, so I know how they work for
someone that's just getting started or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever like that kind of complicated
thing Not knowing how the plants they have
[SPEAKER_05]: in their stable Might even breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it could be there could be more
missteps Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucked up a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, so don't don't there and
there's and that don't mean fuck up I just
[SPEAKER_05]: mean like you breed things you hope that
these two things come out of them and they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't Yeah, so it's like you just have to
try it a different way You have to try a
[SPEAKER_05]: different pairing you have to see if they
blend You know and the more stages you
[SPEAKER_05]: have to do that, you know, the you have to
get you have to get bigger, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so Anyway, they uh But yeah,
that's that's roughly how you would do
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that Yeah, you know and
then you want me to pick something out for
[SPEAKER_05]: you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can go ahead and fire off some
traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll write it down Fire off some traits
and I'll do it from the fan angle from the
[SPEAKER_02]: fan angle Or I could do regular tube and I
just figured I'd do fan No, no,
[SPEAKER_05]: you should do them because because that's
that's more direct and it's easier for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to to get right so I wanted it like
the main reason I wanted to do it was I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to illustrate to people How hard it
truly is to be able to say my seeds are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to deliver XYZ And to be consistent
with what they say they're delivering it
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more that goes into it than
just I'm gonna make a cross and these
[SPEAKER_02]: things smell like this And that's the way
the seeds are gonna come out It's just not
[SPEAKER_05]: one way one way for people one way for
people to look at it is like how genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: work is When you're crossing two things
that are pretty simple or especially
[SPEAKER_05]: things that are widely divergent from one
another Like say for instance Neville
[SPEAKER_05]: crossing nl5 and haze Or me crossing maple
and Mendo P like you can see the
[SPEAKER_05]: differences Yeah, because there's certain
things to look for like it Neville's
[SPEAKER_05]: growing some shit and it's super tall and
thin-leafed and grows like a tree It's
[SPEAKER_05]: hazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it stays short and wide-leaved and
Afghan and stout and you know all that
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably nl5 haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know and for Mike the hybrid I
was talking about you can look at purple
[SPEAKER_05]: You know and and some of the traits that
are unique to Mendo P, but If you cross
[SPEAKER_05]: things that are similar to each other,
it can be a real pain in the ass Yeah to
[SPEAKER_05]: try to figure out which one leans what way
which one's breeding which way You know
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly, you know, and so there's there's
an aspect there where I guess what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: saying is that we have entered the era
where Most things are like a mass
[SPEAKER_05]: hodgepodge unless you go older strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a big mix of genetics these
days Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people start putting these things
together and you try to put a like a
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, you know, like a frickin Cush
mints, you know by soured soured up two
[SPEAKER_05]: things with like huge histories.
[SPEAKER_05]: What could you get?
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a mass amount of shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes for those two especially push mints
and yeah, and the sour dubs Britain not
[SPEAKER_05]: too uncomplicated or whatever,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So So let's say let's Let's say you were
gonna hunt something.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right You know, what are you gonna
hunt?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of traits do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you're a customer and you're buying
for Some big corporation and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: these certain wants you may you don't even
have to want them But someone wants these
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're giving the direction on what
these traits are that they want Okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: so they want something that's gonna be
high yielding Yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay high THC potency high THC potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah got it Can can go up to ten weeks up
to ten weeks up to ten weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and And let's see here give me three
more give you three more All right,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then so I don't want to say purple
because I just did that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Let's just say that it has to have It
has to have citrus turps
[SPEAKER_05]: Brutal okay, why and wash well Because
they're good because they want those those
[SPEAKER_05]: high yielding citrus extracts as well as
that Okay, and so what do we got now?
[SPEAKER_05]: We got it's got a yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well one more Well high THC up to ten
weeks citrus wash as well High THC wash as
[SPEAKER_05]: well that should pretty much cover it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you those Okay, okay The high
THC let's see I'm gonna give myself a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna have I'm gonna give it density
because otherwise I would just say let me
[SPEAKER_05]: do that it I mean as long as it yielded
well Yeah, and and wash as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the fucking I don't think
the client is gonna give a shit Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this this like it would be probably
lemon G or like lemon G Something like
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon tree but if I were gonna make a fem
line from scratch without the obvious shit
[SPEAKER_02]: and also leaving out like cookies and OG
and stuff like that and I'm not I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: remove lemon G because it's just too
obvious and with citrus, let me see here
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go
[SPEAKER_02]: One second see 99 grapefruit as the start
and end Oh, man, there you go on the male
[SPEAKER_02]: side because I know that this is the
dominant Oh wait, I'm not doing male doing
[SPEAKER_02]: female but so it's even easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's also the dominant Sent
expression from c99 the seed lines going
[SPEAKER_02]: around so it's gonna be more commonly
occurring So when I'm choosing this female
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's showing that it has a citrus
grapefruit turps It'll likely also breathe
[SPEAKER_02]: for those knowing c99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I do So we know we've got that
covered but we also know c99 is like a
[SPEAKER_02]: seven to eight weaker So we've we can
allow ourselves to bring up the THC with
[SPEAKER_02]: something a little more a Little more
typically sativa and I would do I would do
[SPEAKER_02]: a clone from Appalachia Appalachia green
crack trade on You got the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the wash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you got some Somebody actually just
said Appalachia by c99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah in the comments hilarious That's
that's what I would do a good cut like a
[SPEAKER_02]: green crack dominant cut with a little bit
of gas of Appalachia and to a c99
[SPEAKER_02]: grapefruit reversal and I would probably
you know Do it under metal halides on
[SPEAKER_02]: tables small plants More plants In numbers
for the reversal as opposed to bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd want smaller and more And yeah,
that's how I do it That's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No c99 doesn't wash super well,
but green crack washed pretty good and I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe Appalachia will too especially
because the trade dog And I mean the other
[SPEAKER_05]: thing that you could do too is that if it
ended up not washing well Then you could
[SPEAKER_05]: have a c99 Appalachia hybrid that gave you
some Citrus and some bag appeal and some
[SPEAKER_05]: weight You know and and was gonna come in
within the time and he could go another
[SPEAKER_05]: step.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say he failed Yes, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say that failed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say that got you high yielding
plants Right that had some citrus But it
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't wash very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but you got high potency high yield
and you had citrus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but you're short They're trying to
they're trying to run it they're trying To
[SPEAKER_05]: they're trying to make ice water.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing all this different stuff BHO
and it's just coming out at a percentage
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not making their extraction happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah now you need another step.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need one more step for resin production
I'm gonna cheat and go for the white The
[SPEAKER_02]: white you're gonna go for the white the
classic boost resin production The turps
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't that great, but I've seen it
combined well with stuff that is really
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant like c99 So I'd probably add the
white In there because it was also it also
[SPEAKER_02]: has that that huge bag appeal and it does
have good THC Do you think the c99 citrus
[SPEAKER_05]: is strong enough?
[SPEAKER_05]: That it would carry through and a lot of
those hybrids still and still be dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do I think you can't wash it out I think
it's kind of like deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you think it would be it would be one
of those things where like the the sheer
[SPEAKER_05]: blandness of the white Yeah, wouldn't
dominate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep So then we'd have a c99 by By
Appalachia by the white Appalachia C99
[SPEAKER_02]: white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the way I do except reverse
the white because I also know the white
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse as well That was the other thing I
was thinking all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the other part is you get a
failed reversal And I know the white
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse as well rascal did it
consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it a few times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a good one interesting,
I mean I And that ladies and gentlemen is
[SPEAKER_05]: when you start talking to corporate guys
about what they want Why things like Jack
[SPEAKER_05]: Herrera and Jack Herrera hybrids are
blended into everything because they're
[SPEAKER_05]: like I want three pounds of light Mm-hmm
gotta look pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be quick You know, I want it
sativa high and it's gotta be eight weeks
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and so then they're like,
oh c99 Jack Herrera like I remember when
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado I was gonna make fun of you but I
held off when Colorado went legal You
[SPEAKER_05]: don't think like I remember that everybody
was getting three pounds of light,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it was all hybrids of Jack Herrera
Durbin poison green crack and there was
[SPEAKER_05]: one more because it was anything that
threw like big long for all Golden goats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and they would just hybridize things
looking for phenos that they would get
[SPEAKER_05]: three pounds of light Yeah, you know and
so everything was crossed to like one of
[SPEAKER_05]: those four things because they all looked
at it from like mathematics You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think Realistically why c99
still is popular today even is even more
[SPEAKER_02]: so than Even more so than Jack Herrera
even I think c99 still dominates is
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the outdoor scene in California
and because of that demand for a sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: type that's super fast lowering the
finishes in time in NorCal and I tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: think Appalachia is gonna be what totally
wipes c99 out when enough people run it it
[SPEAKER_02]: had a good it had a good run for a while
By a high and lonesome when he originally
[SPEAKER_02]: made it and then Bodhi did a bunch of
crosses with it But I still think it's got
[SPEAKER_05]: its its big run coming Jack does carry the
turpentine turps for generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, you know Green crack is actually a
really nice strain grown Well,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah most people have got a bad name
because there was a bunch of people that
[SPEAKER_05]: would grow six to ten pound outdoor plants
kind of be great of it and got blown out,
[SPEAKER_05]: but If you grow a nice little four to
eight ounce plant And you know and you
[SPEAKER_05]: treat it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got some nice turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a sweet high It's not like knock
you out like but it's it's pretty You
[SPEAKER_05]: know, it might be like if it is mostly
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be my favorite example of scum
Yeah, yeah I would I would say like just
[SPEAKER_05]: the way sometimes like when it comes out
really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bud is really green and the Crystal is
really silvery You know, and it's it's got
[SPEAKER_05]: a nice sweet turp to it You know,
there's a good there's a good chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a Mendo perp skunk one of
sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that Green crack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, holy fuck that would trip me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean it's mango terpy It's very
purple with even a slight bit of cold But
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's like black people say where
can I find it?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing is that real green crack
was so common that all of a sudden It's
[SPEAKER_05]: like really hard to find the real one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and you know, it got renamed honestly
in like the Name because real because
[SPEAKER_05]: we're green crack got a bad name like
brokers put off on it But then when the
[SPEAKER_05]: extract era happened, I'm convinced that
there's a bunch of papaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just fucking green crack It could
be yeah, you know, I'm not saying 100% all
[SPEAKER_05]: of it But like when you extract green
crack and you wash it it has nice tropical
[SPEAKER_05]: fruit turps Some people get papaya some
people get mango some people get whiffs of
[SPEAKER_05]: other things depending on their nose or
whatever But you know it it has that
[SPEAKER_05]: similar profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah in that regard, you know But I I
think because of certain traits there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: good chance that Mendo perp stand to be in
that lineage I'm surprised you never
[SPEAKER_05]: noticed that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would I would honestly trip out if that
was the I mean, I've been wrong before
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll say that and I we've had good
friends of ours that that told me things
[SPEAKER_05]: that I was just like Oh, no, and then
later on I was like, whoa, whoa,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so it's it's possible but You
know, I the story of that one is pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: mysterious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very mysterious because there's the
tale of Cecil and when I when I first
[SPEAKER_02]: encountered it was through through James
Holland he had green crack but we had it
[SPEAKER_02]: labeled as green Kush with the C in our
room and it actually said green Like
[SPEAKER_02]: written out Kush with the C So because of
that when I first went online people were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about how well Cecil C has a Kush
with the C so for a long time me and Cecil
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to meet up so we could talk about
this stuff and figure it out and when we
[SPEAKER_02]: finally talked it sounds like his Kush
with the C was very skunky like he says
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that he said to San Diego was very
skunky which is not Like the green crap or
[SPEAKER_02]: the green Kush that was in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it originates in San Diego
I don't know if it originates in Mendo or
[SPEAKER_02]: up up in Humboldt It could be from frickin
Oregon for all we know with a different
[SPEAKER_02]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it made it to SoCal with the name
Green Kush with the C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, and then It became green crack
after that people are throwing around
[SPEAKER_05]: different things people are asking like
well How do you source what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding with and to be honest?
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like I never really did a bunch
of breeding projects where I had to go out
[SPEAKER_05]: and like have a Treasure map and find the
things I wanted Mostly you end up breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: with stuff you have access to yeah,
let's be real We were creating a
[SPEAKER_05]: hypothetical situation and I tend to have
a so I tended to pick things in my library
[SPEAKER_05]: not hypothetical things that have to get
but like actual things that I possess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's just where my mind goes,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be infinitely harder to like be
like, oh well I need to do a project
[SPEAKER_05]: that's gonna take three or four steps and
I need to gather a Bunch of different
[SPEAKER_05]: things that are gonna be new to me,
you know, and there's an aspect People are
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about if I don't think phylos
phylos can't actually determine family
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships the way that we one day one
day we will sit down and a few of us will
[SPEAKER_02]: tell the story about how we put phylosis
science to the test by using known clones
[SPEAKER_02]: known parentage of these clones and
Submitted them to phylos to see if they
[SPEAKER_02]: could truly determine parentage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's one day Yeah, there's an aspect
to where people are saying green crack and
[SPEAKER_05]: blue dream got played out right at the
same time Yeah, you know there's there's
[SPEAKER_05]: an aspect, you know because I live in
Mendocino County or whatever like and for
[SPEAKER_05]: a long time it was sort of like the heart
of of You know outdoor and stuff in
[SPEAKER_05]: California before it spread A lot of times
you would have plants that were really
[SPEAKER_05]: nice on their own like the blue dream or
the green crack or the berry white or the
[SPEAKER_05]: this or whatever it might be and they get
there's an era where like they're really
[SPEAKER_05]: popular and they're and they're moving
really well and people are growing really
[SPEAKER_05]: nice examples of them and then there's a
point where people realize how much money
[SPEAKER_05]: they can make and they can throw out 99
plants and get eight pounds of plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: you do the math and so all of a sudden
there's all this B and C grade of the same
[SPEAKER_05]: Strain and it kind of harshes the strain
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of times people will be like,
oh that strain sucks and Really what
[SPEAKER_05]: happened is is the market got exploded by
a bunch of low quality enormous waves of
[SPEAKER_05]: it because it was super profitable and
Then the you know, the you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it moves on and so people move on You grow
a little four ounce plant of green crack
[SPEAKER_05]: or blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd probably be pretty happy Yeah,
you know you grow it nice, you know you
[SPEAKER_05]: grow a little Three four ounce plant of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you'd probably be stoked and so are
your buddies Blue dream because I was
[SPEAKER_02]: still very heavily involved in the seed
seed business when blue dream got real big
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that got blown up and What I saw
happen right before my eyes Was there was
[SPEAKER_02]: a few of us that made s ones of that
original cut and released it in some good
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids and then we saw major Spanish
companies Making seed lines called blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream that had nothing to do with blue
dream the cut they would combine like a
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry and and their hazes whatever
they had and put that on the market and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to name any names or anything
But certain companies would buy these
[SPEAKER_02]: import them to the US and all of a sudden
these blue dream seeds were Everywhere the
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude was doing giveaways with
everything you bought you would get these
[SPEAKER_02]: blue dream seeds So blue dream hit the
country in mass, but it wasn't blue dream
[SPEAKER_02]: It was blueberry haze from some Spanish
company with with the California market
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the majority of that actual blue
dream, but right and I mean there's an
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect too where I think that for most
plants there's a window of Of quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know it varies plant to plant
but I actually think a lot of the indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: look is Just because people are growing
relatively small plants compared to
[SPEAKER_05]: outside and yeah, you know So you're only
asking a plant to give you say like one to
[SPEAKER_05]: eight ounces it'll have a vastly different
Look, then if you're asking that plant to
[SPEAKER_05]: give you a pound or two pounds or three
pounds or eight pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I've had I've had times where it
was like when we were transplanting and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like some plants got broken off at
the stem Yeah, and so not used and so I
[SPEAKER_05]: would grow these like depths and these
plants would get like a pound and then
[SPEAKER_05]: Like helpers wouldn't want to throw away
the ones we broke So there'd be like a
[SPEAKER_05]: branch this big a stem this big with a few
branches coming off it and when we pulled
[SPEAKER_05]: that stuff Down that look stuff looks so
amazing compared to compared to like the
[SPEAKER_05]: the rest of it because it was like three
ounces Yeah, and it was just super frosty
[SPEAKER_05]: and choked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's an aspect certainly with
different plants of like there's a size
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet spot Yeah, where you get I like blue
dream at four to six ounces That's where
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like just fucking perfect every
fucking time most weed is if it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_05]: good weed You know, that's a decent that
it can say can get that big, you know Some
[SPEAKER_05]: plants can get to a half pound some plants
can get to a pound but there's a there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: point of diminishing quality Yeah,
absolutely You know where it's like the
[SPEAKER_05]: resin doesn't stretch or the turps don't
stretch or the plant just has to put so
[SPEAKER_05]: much energy Into its stem and its
structure and it's how it's gonna survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have enough to put into You
know, it's the quality of its weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean there's people that swear
that small little plants in one gallon
[SPEAKER_05]: pots You know or Or is the headiest wheat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's I know that When CSI was
talking about ship buds Sour that he talks
[SPEAKER_02]: about is like some of the best smoke he's
ever had out of it Millions of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's probably smoked He always says that
you know, it was you know, one gallon pot
[SPEAKER_02]: and a flower power flower and that's it
Yeah, I mean, so there's an aspect There's
[SPEAKER_05]: an aspect there where it's like you I mean
I used to actually do a bunch of breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: that way, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I got smart Smarter I suppose I
should say because I used to just grow up
[SPEAKER_05]: all these fucking seeds and Granted the
era was different But still you'd get all
[SPEAKER_05]: this random weed that you didn't like very
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, cuz let's face it when you're
breeding It's like you're only gonna like
[SPEAKER_05]: so much of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know And then I got and then I
got smart instead of like blooming the
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds I would grow them up and I would
take cuts and I would put them into like a
[SPEAKER_05]: one gallon pot and I would grow like on a
you know, I might grow Like 50 or 100
[SPEAKER_05]: plants on a four by eight and I'm just
going for like a single stock try to get a
[SPEAKER_05]: half ounce Yeah, but that half ounce will
tell me does it have the turps?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it have the high that's enough smoke
and then maybe I can grow out a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: things at once and It's small enough to
still know you're getting the quality the
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimate quality that you can get from
that plant without having to push it hard
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and you're starting from a clone
because that's the other thing that I
[SPEAKER_05]: realized is like a lot of times I wanted
to see like what a clone would do Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: because you only get one shot at the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you only ever see that seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's got a taproot It's gonna act
differently Yeah, so I got more consistent
[SPEAKER_05]: when I just like when I would just take I
would breed and I would I wouldn't flower
[SPEAKER_05]: the seed plants I would flower the clones
Yeah, I would want to see what they did as
[SPEAKER_05]: clones and then I could flower almost like
a sea of green style and Then you could
[SPEAKER_05]: have a hundred or a hundred and fifty
things and if they're like, you know Ten
[SPEAKER_05]: to twenty ounce ten to twenty grams each
maybe a zip Yeah That's one thing that's
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing I've been trying to teach
everybody that's watched like Breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: Syndicate or my my live streams Since I
started doing them is when you buy seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: when you buy seeds and you're popping
seeds You know a lot of people run into
[SPEAKER_02]: Sexual instability issues all kinds of
other issues or they like it the one time
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't like it the rest and they
don't understand Why you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I always tell them I always say don't
worry about blooming the mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about blooming the seed mom
blue blue The clone mom because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're gonna see every time and
that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that's what matters That's
where you need to make your choices from
[SPEAKER_02]: and it'll 99% of the time any sexual
instability issues are gone with the clone
[SPEAKER_02]: 99% time for whatever reason that's how it
works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just different hormones So yeah,
but yeah, I mean I used to get two ounces
[SPEAKER_05]: four ounces five ounces eight ounces all
these different plants all these different
[SPEAKER_05]: sizes all that all that and like it's hard
to do that, but you can actually go
[SPEAKER_05]: through a bunch of plants and you really
Don't need to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really don't need more than you know
10 or 20 grams should give you like a
[SPEAKER_05]: really good idea Yeah, whether or not
which ones you like enough to like work
[SPEAKER_05]: with again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be done on one or two four bytes
Yeah, it doesn't even take that much,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and then you and then you know I
would just toss the seed mom and I would
[SPEAKER_05]: just keep clump, you know clones is back
up Yeah, and as soon as they grew a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit just flip them and I wanted to see
like what the main the main stem Would do
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't top them just try to get spears.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, relatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know I mean, it's not the only
way to do it But it is a way for people a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of people these days They're gonna
have smaller size areas to work with and
[SPEAKER_05]: then if you did that into a greenhouse You
could look what you could look through
[SPEAKER_05]: three or four hundred plants if you want
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but the hard part is gonna be
testing it is Labeling drying it keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: it separate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know Caleb he's got fucking
hangers with all kinds Of color-coded
[SPEAKER_05]: labels on them notes and shit and then
you're trying to keep them all separate
[SPEAKER_05]: and different plastic bag or different
jars or whatever and then you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: like smoke and take notes so let's talk
about like the the downside of Doing too
[SPEAKER_02]: big of a pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was just saying,
you know, it's like how do you you you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, like there's an aspect of like Doing
too big of a pop is cool in the sense that
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're looking for certain physical
characteristics You're going through more
[SPEAKER_05]: faster Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can you can you can sift
through but then you know You know smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say you have 50 things Yeah,
thanks smoke testing all that takes a
[SPEAKER_02]: while and you usually got to engage
friends Yeah, let's say you have 13,000
[SPEAKER_05]: things though That was yeah, I mean that
was a at that point you're not really
[SPEAKER_05]: female.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean you're You're not really female
hunting you're doing some female hunting
[SPEAKER_05]: but you realize that like the vast
majority of it It's gonna get lost of
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, and that's the only time I
mean, you know, we have a pretty big thing
[SPEAKER_05]: going right now with some of Caleb's work
and It's it's like we really get to see
[SPEAKER_05]: what's in the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and how it expresses, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But the vast majority of them are gonna be
kept for any reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah vast majority can't be smoked I mean
it's just to get to that like if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say you're popping 2,000 like how
are you gonna smoke that within a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of period unless you just have
people cheapen for free all day And those
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfuckers don't go away, you know
Yeah, I mean there's an aspect where
[SPEAKER_05]: really like for a hobby gardener I mean a
lot of depending on how people smoke even
[SPEAKER_05]: if you did 60 or 70 things It would take
you, you know, if you smoked two or three
[SPEAKER_05]: of them a day You know, it would take you,
you know almost a month Yeah to sort
[SPEAKER_05]: through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and so, you know You know and then
you could also have certain kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: criteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe some things you smoke one bowl of
and it doesn't have the flavor You don't
[SPEAKER_05]: like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just immediately, you know,
but then it's like how fine of a comb
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know People say cut a clone late
and flower, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of euros that don't like to
keep backup clones and they'll literally
[SPEAKER_05]: do this thing where they'll leave all the
bottoms on their plants and they'll bloom
[SPEAKER_05]: them and their favorites they'll just like
move before the plants fully finished and
[SPEAKER_05]: Re-veg the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know the problem with that that
there's nothing wrong with that method
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of times the easiest things
to re-veg are like the poorly flowered out
[SPEAKER_05]: You know wispy shit on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm So you can cut a plant down and
smoke it and be re-vegging it But it does
[SPEAKER_02]: take months It does it takes a few months
To start kicking back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like I did it a ton for a long
time when I would do Fino hunts because I
[SPEAKER_02]: would try to do as big of a Fino hunt as I
could do and With as many different lines
[SPEAKER_02]: and what usually ended up happening was
that I couldn't keep you know four clones
[SPEAKER_02]: of every single thing that I was Hunting
through so I had to get really good at
[SPEAKER_02]: re-vegging I had to get it right every
fucking time and figure out how to do that
[SPEAKER_02]: and eventually I figured out how to do
that and be Consistent with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's hard and it takes a long fucking
time My buddy that I was mentioning that I
[SPEAKER_05]: did the maple project He was he that he
was just saying he does 50 60 things at a
[SPEAKER_05]: time and it's a bitch Yeah, you know,
it's like you have lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that easy to like it's one thing
to get baked every day It's another thing
[SPEAKER_05]: to like take notes and see how you feel
and you know be looking for certain
[SPEAKER_05]: aspects of things So you either have to be
a super harsh dick or it takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know and so And a lot of times
what sucks, you know is that You know the
[SPEAKER_05]: runty shitty fucked up plant that you
almost killed Ends up being the most
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting one to smoke and flavor Yeah,
and all the ones that had all this
[SPEAKER_05]: structure and growth and vigor that you
wanted were were just you know Okay
[SPEAKER_05]: compared to some of those other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's always this scrawny shitty one
that doesn't want to revenge the most
[SPEAKER_02]: stubborn one That's usually the one I want
to keep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean obviously like I mean imagine
Imagine if you know the og craze happened,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like og grew like blue dream Yeah
There really would be blue dream
[SPEAKER_05]: billionaires Yeah, you know and all that
because it's like that but that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the kind of intro maybe we could
talk about that for a minute because Well,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's interesting is that I was talking
about like when things went legal in
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado and all of a sudden all these
high-yielding plants started getting bred
[SPEAKER_05]: into all the indoor because That's what
met the model.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there is a risk as things become
legal that the weird Runty fucked up
[SPEAKER_05]: offshoots that we all know and love that
end up becoming like our elites get cold
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because they don't meet the
production model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I remember even even when sub cool
was at the height of Breeding fame I would
[SPEAKER_02]: call it even what he what he had what I
would call his genuine fame at one point
[SPEAKER_02]: that dude was pretty Famous and he was
putting it out there I'm gonna interrupt
[SPEAKER_05]: them for a second Our homie from Hawaii
was saying taking cuts two or three weeks
[SPEAKER_05]: into flower is nice They stay small and
about the time they revedge you're
[SPEAKER_05]: finishing up the round That's what CSI
does a whole bunch His primary method is
[SPEAKER_05]: to take clones clean up the bottoms about
two weeks into that into bloom and then
[SPEAKER_05]: that Slows down and they freak out for a
while, but they kind of are on the same
[SPEAKER_05]: timing as your room So around the time you
figure out which ones are good Or hope,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know there because they get because
you can get them too big and then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: chopping them back Yeah, I was gonna say
sub cool He would call a lot of seeds in
[SPEAKER_02]: the seedling stage like in the seedlings
things he would do major culling and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: always a big opponent of that because I
found it like a lot of the slower growing
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff can be just as Amazing a keepers for
different reasons, you know But for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while that that was in cannabis and still
kind of is a common thought that if it's
[SPEAKER_05]: weak as a seedling call it Well,
I mean there's nothing wrong with that in
[SPEAKER_05]: in in a certain aspect But then it's just
making it harder to find what you want
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're trying to guarantee that
it's gonna be in a strong and vigorous
[SPEAKER_02]: plant Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's one thing we know about
cannabis is that like the weak the weak
[SPEAKER_05]: shitty ones Sometimes have a tendency of
being like the markets favorite Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh gee kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even believe that wasn't called at
the beginning just to how floppy to end
[SPEAKER_02]: and it has so many traits that are hard I
mean, let's talk about you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: do you know the thing that I will put this
number one all time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe it was called The quays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah How how can you grow something
that takes that long and every bud is like
[SPEAKER_05]: a tiny fingernail sized Fucking Kalex
ripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it becomes one of the more
famous strains and in Holland That was a
[SPEAKER_05]: labor of love because there's a bunch of
people that would look at that halfway
[SPEAKER_05]: through and be like what a mess death so I
I got phenos like that or expressions like
[SPEAKER_02]: that from Alaskan ice seeds that I
purchased from Seed madness I want to say
[SPEAKER_02]: in the UK Yeah, it spit out phenos like
that and they were immediately called Like
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anything of it was before I
had ever seen or run the quay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you would just kill it You'd be like
this is super fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the worst thing ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is horrible shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like Elvis Yeah, this is fucking
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just kill it, you know,
and that's actually what Neville did to
[SPEAKER_05]: about half his hayseeds that popped Yeah,
they were so sparse and fucked up that he
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't realize what he had and he called
him and then he smoked it And then yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody was saying OG KB OG KB is an
excellent example of something that would
[SPEAKER_05]: never make a production model.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Super slow Takes forever to veg
doesn't yield that much, you know all that
[SPEAKER_05]: and so I always think of tomatoes,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's been this heirloom tomato
sort of Renaissance in America Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: but when people are like you go to the
grocery store, you see lots of delicious
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetables or whatever but tomatoes are
bred for size and weight and color and did
[SPEAKER_05]: not rot and did not split and Flavors way
down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the tomatoes that get stuffed into most
people's grocery stores are like big
[SPEAKER_05]: money-making watery It's like all the
production values are paramount Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the part where it's delicious and it
tastes good and has the flavors that we
[SPEAKER_05]: want like we can't force them to do that
Which is why a lot of people think
[SPEAKER_05]: store-bought tomatoes stuck suck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah So but what I mean by that well,
yeah But what I mean by that is that like
[SPEAKER_05]: as cannabis goes into a production model
and they start Looking at square footage
[SPEAKER_05]: and cost and yield and this and that and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: There could be very different Pressures
put on what strains make it to the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the OG would never have made it The
OG KB would never have made it the quay
[SPEAKER_05]: the you know The quays would never have
made it like there's a lot of varieties
[SPEAKER_05]: out there for one reason or another That
wouldn't fit somebody's production model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I was always surprised when cookie
showed up like the form cut because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: so low Yielding like so so low yielding
compared to what was typically going
[SPEAKER_02]: around even even most OG cushions had been
They had figured them out to make them
[SPEAKER_02]: yield their cookies was just so low
yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was shocked that it ever Got commercial
viable viability.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it would have without I mean
there was an aspect where prices were
[SPEAKER_05]: starting to fall Yeah, and and Instagram
was young And it was like a perfect moment
[SPEAKER_05]: where it gained a bunch of popularity and
then it sold for high dollars So it was
[SPEAKER_05]: almost kind of like the same thing with
Kush right like and our buddy resin It's
[SPEAKER_05]: like sure you might not get as much weight
as you were getting off other things until
[SPEAKER_05]: you figured it out But if you were selling
it for seven grand a pound you really
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah There was some there was some like I
can get lower yields off this baked into
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah You know, but and it's still yeah
makes way more money than otherwise Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's an aspect now where it's
like yeah biomass People are looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, like weight on you know,
wet weight how much I can extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's my yield?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's my this where the previous
selection process in cannabis was entirely
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer based Yeah, right almost all
these fads needed a bunch of people at the
[SPEAKER_05]: other end willing to buy it for top dollar
Yeah, that's what drove the purple craze.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what drove sour that's why sour was
the best-selling weed in America was
[SPEAKER_05]: because There was this massive corridor on
the East Coast that this couldn't get
[SPEAKER_05]: enough of it Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it became part of the culture It
became part of the culture, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then Kush had its whole moment in
Southern California and elsewhere Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know and then cookies was the bay and
then you know And you have skittles
[SPEAKER_05]: winning all these awards and stuff So a
lot of that stuff is I mean we used to
[SPEAKER_05]: joke when we first got the real skittles
Where it was like you'd start vegging next
[SPEAKER_05]: year's gap now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah You know cuz it was like odds give it
a good six month veg And it'll be three
[SPEAKER_05]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I remember the first time my buddy I
had a good friend of mine that got
[SPEAKER_05]: skittles kind of before it was it was
named that as much And he grew these
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had Lake County beautiful Sun 400
gallon pots, you know all organic really
[SPEAKER_05]: nice and he called me up all panicked and
wanted me to come out And I was like
[SPEAKER_05]: walking this was like back in the trees
era So I'm walking through he has sought
[SPEAKER_05]: diesels and green cracks and you know
different things and they're all You know
[SPEAKER_05]: nine ten feet tall trellised out,
you know scat all that and then you walk
[SPEAKER_05]: to this section and there's like five
skittles and They're like come up to like
[SPEAKER_05]: my waist Yeah, I bet that's and they're
all wide and like little chunks and his
[SPEAKER_05]: buddy was like I'll give you like four
times as much But you're looking at these
[SPEAKER_05]: like tiny little ruts.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all started at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and he thought he was fucking up
Yeah, he just didn't realize that it grew
[SPEAKER_05]: eight times as slow as anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah You know and so there's that aspect
too Where it was like skittles would never
[SPEAKER_05]: pass any kind of production model Skittles
looks like they've got a goddamn disease
[SPEAKER_05]: But skittles is ugly as flour for the most
part, you know, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind I am totally a pre cookie
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm fine with ugly flour that works
good But you know, it's very slow growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bit mold prone You know,
but none of that mattered when it was
[SPEAKER_05]: winning a bunch of awards for extraction
exactly Because you're just testing the
[SPEAKER_02]: extract and the hash was fired and that's
that was my point about the potency
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect, too It's like yeah I mean like it
used to be a major deal that if the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't potent But that's not such a deal
breaker anymore with the extract market
[SPEAKER_05]: thriving.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean in fact I'll you know I was
joking with you about citrus and it was it
[SPEAKER_05]: was a little I gave that me saying citrus
gave you a bunch of pads because there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of kinds of citrus and Citrus for
people that don't know also tends to breed
[SPEAKER_05]: fairly dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you know orange things a lot of time
Pass orange grapefruit grapefruit lemon
[SPEAKER_05]: lemon that kind of thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty dominant turf You know,
but a lot of times those Those citrus cuts
[SPEAKER_05]: are pretty moderate to mild potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah There's not really a lot of ones that
test very high or by themselves are
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly potent And so I almost think
that like tangy came along at a perfect
[SPEAKER_05]: time Because it was like a big skunk plant
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm shouting out DNA or whatever,
but it was a big citrus skunk plant at a
[SPEAKER_05]: time when a lot of people had forgotten
about citrus because it was so unpopular
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah coincided right with the extraction
movement and That citrus turp passed or at
[SPEAKER_05]: a time a lot of other turps kind of ended
up tasting like Axle grease and it also
[SPEAKER_02]: was not named Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh No, most importantly some people were
like, oh, yeah, it's not named Cali Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so and so I really I don't know if it
would have caught on without that BHO era
[SPEAKER_05]: being timed right then when people were
getting nails and dab kit and all the
[SPEAKER_05]: different little tools and accoutrements
that went along with it, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah And and then it's like you take
something that's like 15% THC and not that
[SPEAKER_05]: potent But if you extract it and it's 80%
well now, okay now we're somewhere Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it might not be a long-lasting high,
but it'll get you high I know there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something and we can keep talking about
this But I know there's something that
[SPEAKER_02]: people wanted you to cover and it's
something that we missed Last time two
[SPEAKER_02]: times ago and it was that you're drying
tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Man Well, let me uh, I'll talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just say because people are
throwing in Cali Oh, so in that big hunt
[SPEAKER_05]: that we were doing Down south or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran a number of CSI's Cali Oh hybrids
And I was actually amazed at how sativa it
[SPEAKER_05]: read Yeah, it really it really did like
even things that were pretty indica that I
[SPEAKER_05]: Thought would be would lean they were big
tall branchy orange smelling You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah the grandpa weed looking Fino's and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was it was a lot more in different
hybrids It was a lot more sativa than I
[SPEAKER_05]: was expecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right I'll say that and Cali Oh went
through periods where it became so
[SPEAKER_05]: unpopular.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost unsellable Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it's the only weed well A type of
Calio is the only weed someone ever
[SPEAKER_02]: brought back to me and said not not this
didn't get me high And there's an aspect
[SPEAKER_05]: with almost with a lot of very citrusy
weed That's like that where people find
[SPEAKER_05]: the high to be some some people find the
high to be fleeting or super short-lived
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they just develop a tolerance to it
after two or three days You know and and
[SPEAKER_05]: other people are fine with it But there is
a percentage of people that develop a
[SPEAKER_05]: tolerance and find it boring Yeah,
and there's definitely a difference
[SPEAKER_05]: someone said cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely a difference in citrus
There are some plants that are like sweet
[SPEAKER_05]: citrus that have almost a creaminess to
them Yeah, and then there's ones that
[SPEAKER_05]: smell like you just sprayed orange cleaner
in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, very stringent an orange just pissed
orange or a lemon, you know something like
[SPEAKER_05]: bitch is very like a Stringent and weird
and and like you sucked on a chemical,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yeah, I hate that that long
lingering Mouth-coding lemon like lemon G
[SPEAKER_02]: and lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you just burn out I I mean,
I'm one of those people I burn out like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's fine to have it in rotation But if I
was stuck with it as my only weed for a
[SPEAKER_02]: month, I would be so bummed I I get yeah,
I don't even put it in rotation I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: like the tip flavor at all and but there
was a moment where with bh o and certain
[SPEAKER_05]: things when that was super popular before
rosin was really hitting that those citrus
[SPEAKER_05]: turps came through really clean and clear
a lot of people made a lot of Money off
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking lemon G in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah lemon G and and the tangy I mean
tangy sort of rocketed DNA to being super
[SPEAKER_05]: busy for four or five years after that
Crockett.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, you know, whatever whatever
whatever combination.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Crockett, you know, so as far as
drying tech man, that's a That's a big
[SPEAKER_05]: subject, but I could chat about it or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I will say that Like, you know,
there's a lot of people that throw a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of stuff out there as far as like what's
drying tech And I think there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: like copycat stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so for me Because I've always been a
smoker I was always interested in making
[SPEAKER_05]: sure my weed came out nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right and curing it you know,
a lot of times people put an enormous
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of weight on what they feed their
plants And all that and like all these
[SPEAKER_05]: different environmental factors and those
those things can all throw in But if you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't cure it the right way A lot of that
gets overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you know And so there's an aspect
where there's no point in my career really
[SPEAKER_05]: really where I was competing on scale
There was always way bigger people than me
[SPEAKER_05]: So I always tried to make sure even if
there was a flood up in my neck of the
[SPEAKER_05]: woods That my weed was just good enough to
go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Right, like some of it's gonna move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah should be mine Yeah, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm right and and so as a result of
that you had to and then on top of that
[SPEAKER_05]: too it's like coming from like a My own
perspective is like I never grew my head
[SPEAKER_05]: stash super separate too much So like I
needed it all to be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah in that regard people are saying
let's hear the dry tech Well, there's like
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's it's just like the breeding tech
or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like there's goals like what are
you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one of the things I had to figure
out was that and this is kind of what like
[SPEAKER_05]: separately led to Curing is that there's
this thing up here that we used now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's permanent but there's this thing we
used to call that called the flood and the
[SPEAKER_05]: flood used to be November December January
and It was it was way too hard to sell her
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's because you know people would
go on vacation people would go to see
[SPEAKER_05]: their families.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's around the holidays Some people know
why some people are back home with grandma
[SPEAKER_05]: And if enough links in those chains
disappear People end up sitting on stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then people figured out that
there was a dry spell in spring And so if
[SPEAKER_05]: you were if you were smart you would hold
on to most of your stuff until spring when
[SPEAKER_05]: it would be both much easier and Much more
higher price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Is the flood happening this year this
year?
[SPEAKER_05]: The flood is the last few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flood is seemingly never stopped We
are we are living in water world.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been no receding.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been no price spiking going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been This is this is yes,
this is the ice caps melting as far as
[SPEAKER_05]: pricing goes on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So But what happened is is that you ended
up needing to figure out like people
[SPEAKER_05]: realize that if they trimmed all their
weed in in fall It both cost a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: money because you had to pay the trimmers
and then for the most part Unless you were
[SPEAKER_05]: really careful about how you stored it
your weed was worse in spring when you had
[SPEAKER_05]: to when you had to sell Yeah, and then
sometimes you're you were growing enough
[SPEAKER_05]: that like you weren't even with the size
trim crew You're gonna have it was gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: take you a while to even get to that weed
Yeah, so you had to be able to dry and
[SPEAKER_05]: cure it right in a way that it stayed nice
Yeah, for a period of time for a variety
[SPEAKER_05]: of reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right And then there's an aspect
where you can always like if you it's
[SPEAKER_05]: basically Like you get one shot to do it
the right way And you can like adapt along
[SPEAKER_05]: the way, but if you fuck up too bad,
you've just ruined it for that round.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah so I know that's like a I haven't
really said anything about the tech,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's like a Reasoning behind it of
how you get there, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So and for people that aren't growers that
are listening I'm sorry if you're bored or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, but because it's about to get a
little specific but basically what I what
[SPEAKER_05]: the way I look at it is that When you're
drying weed, I like to either cut the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant down whole Or chop it into chunks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay relatively relatively big
chunks, okay Someone just said it'll teach
[SPEAKER_05]: me your ways in an eight by four.
[SPEAKER_05]: So If you're worried about temps or you're
worried about water loss or you're a
[SPEAKER_05]: little extra dry You can leave it in
bigger pieces Yeah, because those pieces
[SPEAKER_05]: will hold more moisture because there's a
lot of moisture in the stem If you have
[SPEAKER_05]: really good control over your environment,
you can chop up into smaller mid-sized
[SPEAKER_05]: pieces and hang them that way And I just
hang them up people can you can use
[SPEAKER_05]: hangers you can use netting You can use
you know, it's just a variety of things
[SPEAKER_05]: that allows you to click create lines or
walls is basically how it boils down to
[SPEAKER_05]: and I leave all the water leaf on yeah
hundred percent I don't take off any water
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf and the reason for that is that the
things that fuck up your buds are are
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically air heat and light Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the things that start to oxidize
your weed and start to mess it up Okay So
[SPEAKER_05]: what all that fan leaves do is that they
fold down over the flower and they
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially like if you have fans for air
movement and stuff like that They're
[SPEAKER_05]: generally blowing on the fan leaves not on
directly on your flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's making your flower Darker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's protecting it from wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's protecting it from from white it's
protecting it from the various things that
[SPEAKER_05]: might degrade it and As your plant starts
to dry it'll suck that moisture from all
[SPEAKER_05]: those from all those leaves into itself
Yeah, and that's kind of what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to do is you're trying to get
you're trying to get How do you put it
[SPEAKER_05]: you're trying to slowly?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweat out enough moisture got enough
chlorophyll, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want this to be a slow process?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want it to be a slow process?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see all kinds of things where people
talk about 6060 You know 60 degrees and
[SPEAKER_05]: 60% humidity for two weeks I do disagree
on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the 60% humidity is fine But I
think that that's actually like a little
[SPEAKER_05]: too cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know and it really slows down
Transpiration at times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the 60s is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like I like You know mid 60s And
anywhere really realistically speaking
[SPEAKER_05]: from mid 60s the low 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're pretty safe Yeah, you know in my
opinion like there's ideal and then
[SPEAKER_05]: there's like what you're gonna deal with
and then there's an aspect of like There's
[SPEAKER_05]: a there's an aspect of When you're hanging
it the first three or four days a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of water is going to flow out of
those plants Yeah, so depending on how
[SPEAKER_05]: much weed you have and how much space it
is Like it doesn't really matter if you
[SPEAKER_05]: have a stuffed four by eight Or you have a
stuffed big garage or you have a stuffed
[SPEAKER_05]: warehouse or whatever, whatever size it is
if it's stuffed You know, it can be really
[SPEAKER_05]: hard to have enough dehumidification Yeah
in order to pull that much water out of it
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people lose control or
whatever like the end in a lot of D homes
[SPEAKER_05]: don't even like to work at 60 degrees
either Yeah, so having them a bit warmer
[SPEAKER_05]: really helps But that's one thing people
should all look at is that there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of dehumidifiers if you don't have a
low-grain refrigerant You probably don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have a dehumidifier that's suitable for
drying Yeah, and most dehumidifiers are
[SPEAKER_05]: rated for a certain temperature,
which is quite warm and a certain humidity
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is quite hot and you should look at
like where their operating temperature is,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the dehumidifier says it stops
operating at 58 degrees Yeah, don't run
[SPEAKER_05]: your room at 60 Yeah, it's too close to
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not working You should probably run
it at 70 and give your dehumidifier a
[SPEAKER_05]: chance to work, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so but if you have a low-grain
refrigerator It'll work at those temps So
[SPEAKER_05]: there's basically a mode where it's like
you're just trying to make sure your weed
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't mold and you get that humidity
You're trying to keep it cool and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to get that humidity out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some people vent You know some
people literally exhaust air and bring in
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh air because that's like if the
temperatures and outside or fine or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some people try to do with a
combination of air conditioners and D
[SPEAKER_05]: homes But you're basically trying to keep
it somewhere between the mid 60s to low
[SPEAKER_05]: 70s and temp and you know somewhere
between Ideally 60% humidity, but don't
[SPEAKER_05]: panic if it's 65 or 70 or even 74 or 5 for
the first day or two It should come down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it doesn't that first day,
there's so much moisture Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and depending on how much vegetative
material in a small space.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be insane like you were saying
Yeah, I mean it's it's people are talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about dipping it in hydrogen peroxide You
just don't do that People are doing that
[SPEAKER_05]: because they're trying to pass testing
with various PM or biologicals or
[SPEAKER_05]: different stuff like that hydrogen
peroxide is Is a it's it oxidizes It's
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna it's gonna oxidize various turps
it's gonna oxidize various compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna it's gonna lower the quality of
your weed, you know, yeah So so there's an
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect of and look, I mean these are just
like people can hit me up later.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are just like basic Things it's
actually kind of hard to just walk through
[SPEAKER_05]: like all the little details of how you
would do it But essentially I'm just
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to give you like a range whatever
your equipment might be some people might
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to use outside air some people
might be able to use dehumidifiers and Air
[SPEAKER_05]: conditioners maybe even dehumidifiers and
heaters depending on where they live and
[SPEAKER_05]: what time of year it is But yeah,
just trying to keep the plant in that
[SPEAKER_05]: range and after three or four days Your
plants gonna shrink a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right and once it shrinks a bunch
Then you're in a mode where you're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: start to see Most of that water is gone
and it should be a lot easier for you to
[SPEAKER_05]: moderate your drying room Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like as long as as long as you have the
equipment in place that's gonna make it
[SPEAKER_05]: work, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not really battling in that middle
section.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right so you're just trying to keep
it at those same temps and now another
[SPEAKER_05]: three or four days passes, right and Now
you're in the third stage stage of drying
[SPEAKER_05]: which is actually kind of weird Because
you risk your plants getting too dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm But if you take them down often
after six or seven days They're still got
[SPEAKER_05]: too much moisture in the stem and you try
to bin them up or bag them up and that
[SPEAKER_05]: sweats right out Yeah, it's a lot more
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like to go 10 or 14 days on the line
Yeah, I'm doing it commercially.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually 10 or 12 of them doing it for
myself It's usually more like 14,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, but you might actually have I
have humidifiers Yeah, where sometimes I
[SPEAKER_05]: had moisture bad back into my room Yeah,
sometimes it might be fall and it might
[SPEAKER_05]: have not rained in months and it might be
bone dry and 20% humidity outside And your
[SPEAKER_05]: AC is removing some moisture and so is
your whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you turn off all your D humps
Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you turn off your fans And
because you're just trying to conserve
[SPEAKER_05]: that moisture Sometimes and you're just
trying to get through that next three or
[SPEAKER_05]: four days to let the chlorophyll on the
moisture Slowly sweat out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and if it's too dry, just your stuff
will start to get crisp Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going low and slow Some people
just want to say just leave it at 60 and
[SPEAKER_05]: 60 like the jungle boys or some shit and
you just like let it be I don't actually I
[SPEAKER_05]: think that there's like three distinct
stages and if you treat them different
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little easier to deal with well 60
60 can't work for all types of But
[SPEAKER_02]: densities either like I mean, it's got to
be some range.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of copycat stuff in there So
I'm just kind of trying to give generals
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe I'm talking Fast because it's
kind of a big subject or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But and if you have if you have the right
environment If you have the right
[SPEAKER_05]: environment, like you can actually you
could you can keep it three weeks four
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks, you know It's not like yeah,
you know, you can actually I mean with the
[SPEAKER_05]: right outside and the right inside you can
leave it up there for a while if you
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to I don't tend to like to because
I often have to refill it or I just find
[SPEAKER_05]: that the next stage I can actually get a
lot more control doing it what I do next.
[SPEAKER_05]: So This is where a lot of people fuck it
up in my opinion right here, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I've like talked about
anything too revolutionary yet or any shit
[SPEAKER_05]: like no no but here's where it's a mess is
that there's an aspect where after 10 or
[SPEAKER_05]: 11 days like People tend to think that
they need to store their weed at a
[SPEAKER_05]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's perfect for smoke Yeah,
and you actually probably don't want to
[SPEAKER_05]: store it at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably want to store it like a
little bit too moist Yeah for smoke,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what you're what I end up doing is
at that point Like I think that's where
[SPEAKER_05]: the cure begins, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people think you cure in
jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually cure on the stem Okay,
if you take it off the stem, you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: curing Okay, why is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because most curing and like if you talk
to tobacco farmer people or whatever like
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll talk about this all day or you
know Yeah, they grow tobacco for cigars or
[SPEAKER_05]: different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an interplay between the stem and
the leaf Yeah, the stem and the flower
[SPEAKER_05]: Right and the plant can as long as it's
all connected the plant can move that
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture around itself Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I tend to do is that when it comes
time I will take like a bunch of like
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally like a store like grocery style
paper bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and you open it up and at that point
You got to feel when you're about to seal
[SPEAKER_05]: something up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to think like, you know how like
osmosis and like like Aromas and moisture
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that will try to equalize.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so at that point I've got a bunch of
fan leaves and this is somebody was
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioning earlier when you do it that way
bucking is a bitch It is when you buck
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I put my stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I take most of the no sweet leaf,
but I take most of the big leaf off Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I chop it into chunks that fit
into Like I'm not holding my hands open
[SPEAKER_05]: the right way, but I chop it into chunks
that fit into the paper bag Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know so think about how long a paper
bag is and they're about that size Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you start stacking it with things
that have most not all but most of the
[SPEAKER_05]: family for moved Yeah, and left on the
stem but chopped into chunks that fit
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then that that bin can you that
that paper bag can usually hold between
[SPEAKER_05]: 400 and 600 700 grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so then you fold it over Right and
you put it into a contractor bag Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this might not sound too crazy But
what it does is that you then fill that
[SPEAKER_05]: contractor bag with say depending on how
tall the contractor is like six or nine
[SPEAKER_05]: bags Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so here's here's where a bunch of
people fuck it up in my opinion Right is
[SPEAKER_05]: that it is most people when they take it
down off the line They just throw it as is
[SPEAKER_05]: into a into a plastic bin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, build the bin shut the bin.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a super common way, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the reason Why I don't like that is
because what happens is is you have all
[SPEAKER_05]: that extra stem and you have all that
extra family, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that shit smells like hay Yeah,
it really does.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the stuff that smells like
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the stuff that smells green That's
the stuff that has all the aromas that you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't want and when you put a bunch of
weed or anything into a sealed container A
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of times all that aroma tries to
equalize itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so you're gonna send that aroma All
the way through your week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by picking off most of the big fan
leaves and then by chopping the excess
[SPEAKER_05]: stem off and just leaving it on stem
chunks that are big enough to fit in the
[SPEAKER_05]: bag you remove most of that and so the
vast majority of what's in that paper bag
[SPEAKER_05]: is Either sweet leaf or flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah with some associated stem,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then you fill that thing up and
you turn it over and you put it in there
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so here's where it's also different
than Bintech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right in a bin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people use like the black and yellow
totes, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're like 25 or 30 gallons Okay,
so you fill one of those up and you put a
[SPEAKER_05]: lid on and there's nowhere for it to
breathe and It's two feet of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: weighing down on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so what is that bot?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that bottom third like?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got weight pushing down on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got moisture pushing down on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nowhere for it to breathe,
right So if you put like six or nine paper
[SPEAKER_05]: bags into a contractor, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They They stat they hold their shape Yep,
right They hold their shape So you never
[SPEAKER_05]: have a few thousand grams weighing down on
the bottom?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know because they stack and that
paper holds its shape and the paper,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay The paper actually is porous Yes,
it's not like a bin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of a bin where you have two or
three or four pounds You know of weeds
[SPEAKER_05]: stuffed into a bin and then sealed and
there's no breathability Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: all those bags get to breathe Yeah,
and that breathing is what brings the
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture slowly from the center to the
outside Okay, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you can you can put it in there
Right and and you can tie it off and if
[SPEAKER_05]: you did it just the right way It'll stay
stable like that for straight-up weeks to
[SPEAKER_05]: months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah hundred percent Okay,
and I've done I've done like experiments
[SPEAKER_05]: with friends or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, you know, you trim some up
within a few weeks Yeah, and two months
[SPEAKER_05]: later you go back and all the stuff that
was still in the paper bags has a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: turps Yeah, where where the stuff that got
trimmed has started to ox oxidize Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's an aspect there where the
reason why we came to this is that for one
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't end up with a million bins that
reek that you have to sterilize and clean
[SPEAKER_05]: all the time You end up with like super
light contractor bags and paper bags Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: and let's say you seal up the contractor
bag and it like you open it up and you
[SPEAKER_05]: fucked up and you were a little Too fast
and it's a little too moist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm, right You can then just open and
leave the contractor bag open.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right then if it's if you Really
fucked up you might have to take those
[SPEAKER_05]: bags out of the contractor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but then they all breathe Yeah,
so you can open them up Right and then if
[SPEAKER_05]: you really messed up and you were too
aggressive about it and you feel down
[SPEAKER_05]: there and it feels wet damp and
uncomfortable Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can actually take an empty paper
bag and your full one and you can dump it
[SPEAKER_05]: in there And now the bottom is the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right You just fluffed it
essentially and you can do that one by one
[SPEAKER_05]: to all Of them that's only if you screw up
and you realize that after you've sealed
[SPEAKER_05]: it up for a day It's not as stable as you
want it to be there was too much moisture
[SPEAKER_05]: in there and it actually got re wet yeah,
and you get it the moisture level you want
[SPEAKER_05]: you can seal it back up and you can put it
in there and You know, I've had a
[SPEAKER_05]: situation where like a lot of times an
outdoor season in the fall It took us
[SPEAKER_05]: quite a while to get through all the work
Yeah, so you had to store it in such a way
[SPEAKER_05]: that you could You know you you would you
would keep the quality Yeah, and that
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely Made it all the way to our
parties and shit because I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking that, you know After a fact and it
was still just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh that first year especially.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Pippa myself and and home,
you know the friends like we went and all
[SPEAKER_05]: that weed in those in those bags and jars
We pulled out of that's why most of it was
[SPEAKER_05]: on trimmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're partially trimmed We just
pulled it out of the bags just like that
[SPEAKER_05]: tech and it had been sitting in there for
two months Yeah, and most of our close
[SPEAKER_05]: friends to be perfect We honest and even
in our circle and our discord and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that that have tried this method keep
using There's ways you can refine it I
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of skimmed over a certain parts but
because there's depth and there's things
[SPEAKER_05]: that can come up but as far as like a
modular Small the large scale way,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times people like they talk about
curing in turkey bags or curing in the jar
[SPEAKER_05]: You're actually not really curing your
fermenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes You're changing gas when people talk
about burping.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not actually cure You know What
makes it fermenting as opposed to curing?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this there's I mean, it's like I
don't want it I don't want to misspeak and
[SPEAKER_05]: have somebody jump in that knows more than
me about it But but but but in general
[SPEAKER_05]: what it boils down to is there's some
acts.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some interplay Between each of the
flowers being connected to the stem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that doesn't mean you can't put it
In a jar and it improves over the first
[SPEAKER_05]: few weeks in the jar, too I'm just saying
that like a lot of times people think they
[SPEAKER_05]: remove it from all they remove it from the
stem way too fast Yeah, and like if you
[SPEAKER_05]: let that that few weeks, I would even tell
people like once you put it in that
[SPEAKER_05]: contractor Just leave it alone for a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, leave it alone for ten days and then
go back to it and then trip And we've had
[SPEAKER_05]: we've had a bunch of friends that have
tried it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they all keep using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and they all feel like It improved
their personal smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I wanted you to tell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important So so yeah, there's an
aspect and there's there's there's parts
[SPEAKER_05]: of it where you know, like I said I
glossed over certain things because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of long and involved and then you
could ask a bunch of detailed questions
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff that went on and I wasn't trying
to like drown people and But anybody can
[SPEAKER_05]: reach out about it because I want people
to have better weed and there it is true
[SPEAKER_05]: low and slow but I definitely think
There's drying and there's curing and then
[SPEAKER_05]: there's jarring and a lot of people just
dry and jar Yeah, and they miss that
[SPEAKER_05]: middle part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, and doesn't mean your weeds not good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not dissing your weed I'm just saying
that like I've found You know for a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: the things that I grow that I get better
flavor profiles When you give that plant a
[SPEAKER_05]: week or ten days or two weeks to interplay
Between the stem and the flower and back
[SPEAKER_05]: and forth and all that and cure In a big
pile in into itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know because back in the day
when things move really fast a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: times people would I just smoke some in
New York people would They would just dry
[SPEAKER_05]: weed as fast as they could get it to
market Yeah, and it would have a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit of that chlorophyll tang I had
somebody try to tell me it was like they
[SPEAKER_05]: only smoke it like that because after two
weeks the live terpenes fade And I was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, yeah, I've just smoked plenty of
weed that was dry Fast for commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it, you know, like yeah Yeah You
know and so yeah people can be you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're yeah most people skip curing they
go from right from drying You know right
[SPEAKER_05]: from drying to jarring right from jarring
right from drying to packaging,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, yeah and And this tech it's like
it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all that stuff is really available.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nothing special It doesn't take up a
ton of space in your house.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can condense you can reuse the the
paper bags Multiple times if you treat
[SPEAKER_05]: them, right, you know, you can shove a ton
of them into one or two contractors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's light as a feather You know,
it's modular.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can fit in a closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can fit in a garage you can they can
stack on top of each other because and and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's one thing like and you pointed out
sometimes you might need to fluff it but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's okay because not so professional
fluffer Yeah, indeed
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you need to go sometimes you
need to make you know from bottom to top
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to really just change up what's
going on And you know, that's the thing is
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like when you do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to do any of that I just
wanted to go through like Because it is
[SPEAKER_05]: weird and we have close friends of ours
that when we first when I first showed
[SPEAKER_05]: them how to do it They thought they were
putting it away too wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and a lot of times they don't
realize that it stores really well like
[SPEAKER_05]: that But then sometimes it does get too
wet like it gets a little mushy or it's
[SPEAKER_05]: scary wet or whatever and you let it
breathe and so there's a variety of ways
[SPEAKER_05]: you can let it breathe and You know,
this is like I just don't I don't like
[SPEAKER_05]: plastic bins for a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't breathe at all And so what
happens what happens in anaerobic
[SPEAKER_05]: environments?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, it just creates stale air and
moisture Hanging and different kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: different kinds of processes happen in low
oxygen versus higher oxygen environments
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, you know and so there's An act
there's an aspect of that where it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: so even if you screw up a few times
There's like various ways you can get out
[SPEAKER_05]: of panic mode Yeah, sometimes all I had to
do was just open the top of my contractor
[SPEAKER_05]: and leave it in the living room for you
know a night or half a day and All of a
[SPEAKER_05]: sudden the excess moisture had breathed
and escaped, you know, those paper bags
[SPEAKER_05]: are dry So like they will absorb a little
bit of excess moisture without becoming
[SPEAKER_05]: damp, you know, so that helps too and You
know, there's There's just it just keeps
[SPEAKER_05]: the weight because that's what you don't
want is you don't want pressure and low
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen and You know, you want things to be
able to breathe you want things to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to like slowly take that last bit of
moisture out From the center of the buds
[SPEAKER_05]: and from the center of the stems and bring
it out into the flower Yeah, and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: you know your your weed burns better,
you know, yeah your weed burns better it
[SPEAKER_05]: tastes better I've grown a lot of strains
over a long period of time and I have A
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of repeats and so, you know you you
grow it one way for a while and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: like Oh, I killed it and you grow this
other way and you you don't get the trim
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get the dry right and then
you're like, oh I fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah now it's not as good now my weed
That's like three months old still burns a
[SPEAKER_05]: little nicer than this weed that I just
got fresh Yeah, and so you you know and
[SPEAKER_05]: then your friends do that too and then you
have feedback loops and then you know and
[SPEAKER_05]: then you you go through and so there's a
lot of things people can get all tech and
[SPEAKER_05]: you can go to like moisture in the buds
and hygrometers and I'm giving you like
[SPEAKER_05]: hill tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm giving you like observational tech
That's basically by experience and by feel
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you have some basic ground rules
on when not to panic about it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, we have a buddy too that
like is people were talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: elevation earlier as well I mean we have a
we have a good friend of ours that we
[SPEAKER_05]: worked through it and he lives in very
high elevation And his weed dried way too
[SPEAKER_05]: fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah way way too Fast and we were able to
really slow it down and get cures and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: ecstatic Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm not saying it's like this is
like the be-all end-all I'm just saying
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's worked for me and my friends for
a long period of time It's an excellent
[SPEAKER_05]: way to cure weed We I did bring a bunch of
weed to the candle Illuminati parties
[SPEAKER_05]: dried because the candle Illuminati
parties were in December Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: most of that weed came down in October or
November.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was one to two months old Yeah,
by the time that you guys got a hold of
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and All the weed that I brought
whether it was trimmed or untrimmed all
[SPEAKER_05]: went through that whole process Yeah,
and I really do think it brings out
[SPEAKER_05]: quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a way to like not screw it
up at the end Like as far as our group
[SPEAKER_02]: goes like it seems like everybody kind of
contributes one some more than one But
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody kind of brings one major thing
to the table And when I think of not so
[SPEAKER_02]: his drying tech is the one thing I think
he's brought to the table that's changed
[SPEAKER_02]: it for our group as a whole so that's why
I wanted to bring it up because this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of skilled people in our group and if
it's if it's changing their minds It might
[SPEAKER_02]: be something other people are into too
Yeah, and there's you know, there's
[SPEAKER_05]: there's there's patterns to it or whatever
and there's ways you can adapt it here and
[SPEAKER_05]: there and So there's I don't know I just
I've just found it to be really flexible
[SPEAKER_05]: and I haven't found anything that gives me
better quality weed It's not done at all
[SPEAKER_05]: in the commercial market and I think the
commercial market suffers for it You know
[SPEAKER_05]: The the whole curing aspect and the whole
treating it nicely for a bit That seems to
[SPEAKER_05]: be you know shoved away to efficiency
Yeah, and then if you the problem is if
[SPEAKER_05]: you mess it up, you can always rehydrate
weed But it's never the same as if you
[SPEAKER_05]: dried it low and slow and got it sticky If
you can get it a certain stickiness and a
[SPEAKER_05]: certain ratio It can stay good like that
for a really long time And if you get it
[SPEAKER_05]: overly dry, which a lot of people used to
do and then they'd re-moisten for sale
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be alright for a week or two,
but not that long.
[SPEAKER_05]: No And then it'll go back to being a lot a
lot blander Yeah, you know, so if you do
[SPEAKER_05]: it the right way you can get like a weird
sponginess that has enough give to have
[SPEAKER_05]: some moisture in it and But enough,
you know, but it but it's it's really well
[SPEAKER_02]: cured Yeah, and and not so much that it
just goes poof in your hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you hear crunching, that's not
that great You don't want to hear crunch,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I mean the the you know,
it'll probably still get you high but a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of Delicate a lot of delicate turpines
orange peels in the sack all that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all failure Yeah, I mean,
I'm not saying it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong But I'm saying like
your weed is never as good if you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: rehydrate it Yeah, if you have to
rehydrate it you didn't store it the right
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know You know, yeah people
saying this didn't it didn't work at scale
[SPEAKER_05]: on his 30 lighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's ridiculous I mean I like you know,
I mean I did it with like when Mendo first
[SPEAKER_05]: went leaked And we were allowed 10,000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, which is far larger than a 30
lighter, you know Yeah, it's small by
[SPEAKER_05]: today's standards right now, but still You
know, it's it's it's a chunk of pounds
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it works, you know and then on
top of this too It's really easy to do
[SPEAKER_05]: this at a small scale for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just trying to smoke better weed
Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know if you might only have you might
only have one or two or three contractors
[SPEAKER_05]: or something Yeah, you know if you're just
growing for your personal smoke and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: for you or whatever like then it's really
easy to like baby it and then you'll
[SPEAKER_05]: really see Yeah, for sure, you know and
there might be a time too when people want
[SPEAKER_05]: to experiment with it or whatever where
like they get to a point where You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you might end up like if especially if
it's just for you You might end up like
[SPEAKER_05]: trimming some and then leave half the bag
cured and super nice in a cool spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's dry Yeah, and go check on your weed
a month later and see if you like the weed
[SPEAKER_05]: in your jar better or see if you like the
the flower you just Broke off the branch
[SPEAKER_02]: and hold the joint with you might be
surprised Yeah, I know I know Bodhi has
[SPEAKER_02]: this perfect room or did at his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like a humidor and Because where
he lived is just that perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's there's some weed in there from
like a long time years Yeah, and and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all hanging and it's on the branch and you
know, like I've noticed even with seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: like if they're stored in their bud,
they last longer it's like a Natural
[SPEAKER_02]: protection for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think there's a lot of
good aspects even if you're just making
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and drying seeds There's a lot of
good aspects to keeping it on the oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: we used to bury our seed and in 55 gallon
drums And it would all be on the cola.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you wouldn't deseed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would store it You know on a dry cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it makes it great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes great storage makes great storage
They're not they're not rubbing up against
[SPEAKER_05]: each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean a lot of people don't know that
Right, but You know Caleb and I were just
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like that tiger stripe rubs off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah It's a thin layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an it's it's more like a super
thin Tight-fitting skin shell than it is
[SPEAKER_05]: like an embossed feature of a hard shell
People that start people that like hand
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest their seeds and all that and they
treat them really lightly They could end
[SPEAKER_05]: up getting all these dark tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start putting them through like a
blower and sifting them really nice And
[SPEAKER_05]: doing all this extra work to make sure
people get perfect seeds And all of a
[SPEAKER_05]: sudden you could end up with some pale
seeds that were dark before Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: because they lost their tiger stripe
because it just frictioned off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thin Almost transparent skin with
dark stripes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I watched it come off seeds
constantly Yeah, and a lot of us use
[SPEAKER_02]: blowers that make a lot of seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah I was actually just talking the
last few weeks to a to a Jamaican who was
[SPEAKER_05]: telling me about how they store seeds and
they keep Can't bury them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They store them in big 55 gallon drums in
Jamaica and they store them basically
[SPEAKER_05]: either on bud or in the shake Because it
acts like a natural insulation and it
[SPEAKER_05]: protects it from the heat and it works way
They'd rather have a big drum full of
[SPEAKER_05]: shake and seed Then a big or you know buds
and seed then a big thing just full of
[SPEAKER_02]: seed Because it'll die someone asked is it
a more indicate trait tiger stripes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed it a lot in Afghanis and
things the bigger seeds that I see
[SPEAKER_02]: typically from Afghanis, but it's not a
General trait you can apply like that one
[SPEAKER_02]: of them but never mind go on No,
as you can say a lot of the land race like
[SPEAKER_02]: Africans and Malawis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to be smaller black seeds Yeah,
and what I've noticed it also depends on
[SPEAKER_05]: what the mother was Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know you if you're you know,
if your seeds are forming in some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: equatorial sativa They're going to tend to
be smaller because the flower clusters and
[SPEAKER_05]: the calyxes they're forming in are also
small Yeah, and it depends on when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated and where on the plant it's
pollinated how big the seed There's so
[SPEAKER_02]: many things that go into factors,
but like the tiger striping you don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: it a ton in traditional land race narrow
leaf plants and there was an aspect where
[SPEAKER_05]: there was for a long time there was a
misnomer among the community where You
[SPEAKER_05]: know if it wasn't tiger striped enough
that means you didn't let it go to Full
[SPEAKER_05]: maturity and you were trying to sell young
or immature seeds or you were trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: cheat a bit or whatever And so there's a
thing with seeds where people are very
[SPEAKER_05]: visual Yeah, and you know, we have you
know, we have friends or whatever that
[SPEAKER_05]: like won't sell the pale ones Even though
they get crazy germ rates on them Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept a lot of lines off the market that
were just lights or lost their stripes in
[SPEAKER_02]: the blower They just kept them off the
market because I knew it'd be more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: pain in the ass to explain all that And
teach every single person then to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh My god color-coded seeds If you go to
if you go to Greenhouse's site on their
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplishments, the color-coded seeds is
one of the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Don't go to Greenhouse's site.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I will say I did before I before
I dissed them too hard that when I was
[SPEAKER_05]: traveling in the 90s to Holland a bunch
