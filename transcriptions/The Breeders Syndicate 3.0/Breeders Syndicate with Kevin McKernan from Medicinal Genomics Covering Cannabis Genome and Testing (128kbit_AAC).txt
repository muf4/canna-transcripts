[SPEAKER_00]: Brinn did not like my song choice today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me invite you in, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should send and just hit yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lay down, Brinn.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will work on my phone, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably going to be easier than my
cell phone or my laptop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try some, give me a sec.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try some earbuds.
Right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talk as loud as you can, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect time right now with
everything going on with the Philos,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fallout from all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people have a lot of questions for
other companies in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for someone that they can
trust, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the issue.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say that in general,
don't trust me because trust is what has
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten us where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you should look at people's
actions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw this coming many years ago and it
happens in every genomics industry I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been in.
[SPEAKER_03]: People start up a company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They offer a very low cost test to entice
people to submit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They harvest that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns into surveillance capitalism and
then they run off and make a database.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that is fine, I think, if you're
forward with that and if that's the stated
[SPEAKER_03]: intent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think anyone on this thread is
arguing that no one has a right to breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone has a right to grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a right to go and breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is the concern on the table is
did you have a notorious intent?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you deceive people in the process of
doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's probably where most of
the uproar is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how will we not deceive people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't trust us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at our actions is what I'd say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since 2016, when we saw this coming,
we realized, all right, we got to build an
[SPEAKER_03]: antidote.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best antidotes to this are to
enable point of grow testing so people
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to hand over their DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been building those tools for the
last few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: If folks aren't familiar with them,
they're on our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's a variety of people that
actually run them as a service.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't run that service here because
we're not comfortable shipping stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: across state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farm bill has made changes a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still trying to get our head around
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do accept stem samples that can go
in the mail if they're non-viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the ruling from hemp industry
associations versus the DA.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have viable stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to isopropanol treat them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Phylos is doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know whether their stuff is
viable or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's the real issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: At hand, it's that they have your genomic
DNA, and they can do a lot with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaf smears, our lawyers wouldn't let
us put those in the mail because they
[SPEAKER_03]: claim people could tissue culture them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've done cell culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've not done cannabis tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if that's true or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just weren't allowed to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a very thin chance,
unless people have given them tissue and
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, that they're actually doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a bit of a red herring when
they say, we can resurrect or Jurassic
[SPEAKER_03]: Park your strain from DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's partially true.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they can do is they can take your
genomic DNA, amplify certain regions of
[SPEAKER_03]: it, and transform it into other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, we saw that happen with Jay
Keesling.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually amplified out all the
cannabinoid pathway and put it into yeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did this pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you consider how long a lot of the
other companies have been trying to get
[SPEAKER_03]: THC expressing in yeast, the Keesling lab
took everyone by storm and did this very
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Page did this, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got cannabichromine into yeast and
showed that in the most recent Lafferty
[SPEAKER_03]: paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cannabinoid genes are very small.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very easy to clone, and they're
very portable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's possible they can scan through all
the genomic DNA that they've got and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: all right, these strains make THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: These ones make that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should clone a couple of these genes
into other plants and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the genomic DNA, I think, is the real
crux.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to the extent that they're turning and
using that against the manner in which
[SPEAKER_03]: they sold people to submit it in,
that doesn't help that they had that
[SPEAKER_03]: really broad data release policy,
because that probably gives them an out to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's certainly a challenge,
I think, because it was done under false
[SPEAKER_03]: pretense.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's even some posts we've seen where
they've claimed that when people press
[SPEAKER_03]: them on what are your methods,
they say, oh, we use the same methods in
[SPEAKER_03]: the human genome project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's blatantly false.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can attest to that in the court of
law that those aren't the methods they
[SPEAKER_03]: used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can tell that by what they
submitted in the NCBI.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sequencers they used didn't even exist
back in 1999.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a clear stretch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's false advertising going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's where a lot of the
attention should, I think, should be
[SPEAKER_03]: placed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing we did outside of trying
to decentralize the testing so people
[SPEAKER_03]: could do it at the grow, the sequencers
aren't quite point of grow yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They may be in like two or three years
with these nanopores, but they're still a
[SPEAKER_03]: little noisy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hard to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people are still submitting samples
in, we think you shouldn't trust us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should assume one day we're going to
get either pushed out of business,
[SPEAKER_03]: step on the wrong law, federal law,
and get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or let's say the worst case scenario,
Monsanto comes and buys us.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do then?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we've tried to do is make sure the
record of the timestamps of your material
[SPEAKER_03]: are not in our control, and not in
anyone's control, whoever owns our
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way we do that is we take your
sequence and create a hash of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the whole sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's known as a unidirectional
hash function.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your sequence file turns into
gibberish, but it always turns into that
[SPEAKER_03]: gibberish, that fingerprint, when you run
a program called SHA-256.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes a cryptographic hash out of your
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever you present that algorithm with
your DNA file, it will make that same
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't go from the hash back to the
sequence, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we put that hash in a blockchain
transaction so that it's globally
[SPEAKER_03]: distributed on a public ledger with a
timestamp on it that no one in the world
[SPEAKER_03]: can change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we disappear and you still have your
DNA file, you can prove that my sample
[SPEAKER_03]: existed at this particular time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put that in place from day one on
Canapedia back in probably 2014 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long before we saw this risk happening,
we just knew that was the right thing to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are two things that we're trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is we're actively building business
components that enable point-of-growth
[SPEAKER_03]: testing as opposed to trying to hoard
those assays for ourselves to run them for
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those actions, I think, speak for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see, I mean, Seth Crawford has a
CBG line out there now because he used
[SPEAKER_03]: some portable tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used orange photonics to look for CBG
in our UPCR assay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to the extent that we're ever going to
harvest information out of a database,
[SPEAKER_03]: our intent is to turn that into a test the
growers can buy and use themselves,
[SPEAKER_03]: not that we would keep that private and
use it as some advantage to breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've never bred before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not our comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at our history, we've always
built genetic assay tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we want to stay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually think that's a very
attractive market, that if we can build
[SPEAKER_03]: tools that all the breeders can use,
there's plenty of upside to go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's L.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I mean, I hope that's compelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you in a test the fact that
every assay we've built to date,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have all privately funded.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't mean we wouldn't find
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't predict the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we find some marker in the data
that's in Canapedia and that turns into a
[SPEAKER_03]: test people can buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it won't turn into a proprietary
advantage for us to go and compete with
[SPEAKER_03]: the customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not our model.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I think that's a very dangerous
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at businesses, whenever you
polarize your investors against your
[SPEAKER_03]: customers, your end net result is a
lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's not a healthy practice to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to find synergy between your
investors and your customers to make this
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can't do that, I think you're
in for a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the main issue with silos
that some people don't quite understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just hear they assume they're
stealing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if they think they're
going into people's grows, like pocketing
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've not heard any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't support any speculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our lawyers have told us you can only
stick to facts or you'll get libelous
[SPEAKER_03]: claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can only talk about the facts that a
few people have provided.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we didn't even chime into this
until it was three days late because we
[SPEAKER_03]: felt it wasn't our place to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once we saw there's enough
evidence that others presented,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can confirm it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't our place to snowball this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they did that themselves by
first going to breeders like me and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, we're never, ever going to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have a tissue culture lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will never participate in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they went and did that and then
came back and called me a liar,
[SPEAKER_00]: which at that point I was like,
wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now you're Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's your reputation is
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So does anyone have that in writing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the they delivered it all
all verbally over the phone, stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody that has it in
writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what was dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's hard to know what's real now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen a lot of double talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very hard to look through what
they've said and what they've presented to
[SPEAKER_03]: know what is true and what's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know some things that they're putting
on paper aren't real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a different concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the information they're putting
forward to investors is not 100 percent
[SPEAKER_03]: true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they've gone out the videos at
least suggested that they have some
[SPEAKER_03]: exclusive right to Illumina tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Illumina really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they tried to purchase one of our
companies in 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the CEO, Jay Flatley,
really well since retired.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those people are all in the same
circle that I've been in since 1996.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I rang them up and said, hey,
what is this is the first exclusive
[SPEAKER_03]: license I've ever seen you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it's a running joke in the
genomics field that I got an exclusive
[SPEAKER_03]: from Illumina because you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys have been near a monopoly in
the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never give out exclusives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I rang them up like, did you guys give
one out in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, no, send us all the
information is going straight to legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to put an end to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if he's out there presenting stuff to
investors, if he has an exclusive,
[SPEAKER_03]: he needs to clarify that because it's
probably true.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has his own chip, like a 50,000 K SNP
array that they designed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their SNPs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's like 40 million to choose from
in the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can easily make a different one,
change one SNP, and it's a new chip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Illumina doesn't police that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their position is, we'll make anybody a
chip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've offered to make us one as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the economies of it don't look as good
as sequencing to us right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're sticking with a sequencing
approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's something that I think is a
little bit, maybe he didn't have the time
[SPEAKER_03]: to fully explore that or explain that with
on the stage and investors where there
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't people being able to probe him
about the details of that exclusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not completely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's others on there that are
listed as collaborators of theirs and
[SPEAKER_03]: various of their scientific presentations
that we know very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've rung them up saying,
are you really in bed with these guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer has been no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please send it to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to send it to legal and
straighten this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to be misrepresented in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's things on paper that aren't
real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're saying, I can't discern,
because they seem to be giving a
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different story to customers
than they are to investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that leaves us somewhat, OK,
what's true?
[SPEAKER_03]: What isn't true?
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes very speculative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get you some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's 177 people in here right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first question from Strainly says,
Kevin, what prevents MG, medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics, from selling the data you would
have acquired through the tests from your
[SPEAKER_00]: customers?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very complicated to
demonstrate if you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably true.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't sold any database licenses
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had various synthetic biology
companies come and ask us if there's
[SPEAKER_03]: anything valuable in the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, our answer has been we
put most of it public.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the Jamaican lion genome we put
public in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a lot of the canapedia stuff
you'll see, we put public immediately and
[SPEAKER_03]: blockchain hash it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to sell stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something when a lot of it's
online.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're seeing with Phylos is very
different, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: They claimed they were going to be putting
this stuff public to give you guys prior
[SPEAKER_03]: art protections.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were actually hoarding it for two
years at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did have the capacity to go and
sell it to other people because it hadn't
[SPEAKER_03]: been necessarily revealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've not entered into those
arrangements.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say that that would never happen
in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we do have are two different
layers of data release policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're probably going to add a third
after this whole mess just to add a
[SPEAKER_03]: category where people can put data into
our database and it can never be used for
[SPEAKER_03]: other analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, there's a public option where
your data goes public and the whole world
[SPEAKER_03]: can use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd point you actually to there's been
seven papers published off of canapedia
[SPEAKER_03]: data that we're not authors on,
that people just scrape the data and
[SPEAKER_03]: reanalyzed it and published a paper on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to list them afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't recall them offhand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people are grabbing that data and
publishing work on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably people grabbing it and
not publishing work on it and keeping it
[SPEAKER_03]: to themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a class of customers that want to
keep it all private.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only challenge we have in the privacy
event is that we do need to compare it to
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody else's data in order to deliver
the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they want to know if the sample is
related to anything else in the database,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, it's hard to have that data not
compared to everything else and still
[SPEAKER_03]: deliver the relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now realizing we need one more tier
where fine, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can compare it to everything else and
tell us the relationships, but we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want you to then go and sell it to
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want that to remain private.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need another another tier after what
we've seen here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say that probably this is a rough
guess, but probably 70 percent of the data
[SPEAKER_03]: is already public and only probably 30
percent of the people opt to keep it
[SPEAKER_03]: private.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they usually convert it to public once
they once they talk to more people and get
[SPEAKER_03]: more legal opinions on what they should
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a rare case where people are
keeping everything entirely private.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the biggest flaws I saw
from the beginning of Filos was that they
[SPEAKER_00]: they were crowdsourcing data for their
legacy strains, what they call their
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy strains, meaning like, let's say,
for example, Chem 91, the original Chem 91
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, the more people that submit it,
the more likely it is to be the original
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, in fact, in cannabis, that's not how
shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use the same method?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've been reluctant to police the
oral history.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we have all we do is present your
relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do see clusters of like blue
dreams are all next to each other and
[SPEAKER_03]: other ones that aren't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people just make their their
assumptions is what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been reluctant to enable people to
edit the names that they send in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big debate in the company,
whether we should.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we do do that, how do we record
that history?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what can happen in a scenario like
this is if you allow people to edit the
[SPEAKER_03]: name after they see where it lines up to
everything in the galaxy, you tend to get
[SPEAKER_03]: a bias toward the samples that seeded the
galaxy or seeded canapedia.
[SPEAKER_03]: People start to see that, oh, look,
I thought it was OG, but I'm not in the OG
[SPEAKER_03]: cluster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I must have mixed something up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me rename that one in the galaxy so I
don't look like an oddball in the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That creates, I think, a real mess,
particularly if if the data that is that
[SPEAKER_03]: is deriving these relationships is
questionable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this becomes a chaos generator in
the nomenclature system of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think it's questionable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've downloaded their data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we try to run their data through
tools, it throws a lot of it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, throws all of it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you can force it through because we
know why it throws it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this gets in the weeds a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the best tools for doing sequencing QC
come out of the Broad Institute in
[SPEAKER_03]: Cambridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Broad Institute MIT has this program.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's open source.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called GATK, Genome Analysis Toolkit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you take sequencing data, and you run
it through here, and it screens it from
[SPEAKER_03]: the crap that creates bad calls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing it does not like to see are
single PCR amplicons covering a variant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a single PCR amplification event
could get the maternal allele or the
[SPEAKER_03]: paternal allele.
[SPEAKER_03]: And miss one or the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it wants to see at least two
different molecules calling a variant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way it knows you surveyed both
alleles, the maternal and the paternal
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you only have one, you don't know
whether you surveyed both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has a program in there called Picard
that rips anything out that has only a
[SPEAKER_03]: single amplicon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the entire Phylos assay design has got
a single amplicon covering allele.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the Broad wrote this because they
sequence human genomes, lots of human
[SPEAKER_03]: genomes, other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But humans have been mainly their focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And human genomes, this problem is tenfold
less problematic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a variant human to human of one
every 1,000 letters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis is one every 94 letters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when there's that many variants in the
genome, and you're trying to design PCR
[SPEAKER_03]: primers to amplify one of the variants,
what often happens is you put these
[SPEAKER_03]: primers on top of other variants you don't
know about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, you artificially amplify
what your reference was, what you thought
[SPEAKER_03]: you were going to sequence from,
let's say, they probably designed it off a
[SPEAKER_03]: canatonic because they have a nice
canatonic reference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in their design, they may have designed
these primers so that they fall on these
[SPEAKER_03]: variants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They amplify only the mother line and not
the father line, and they get a skewed
[SPEAKER_03]: tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you present the community with these
skewed trees without any peer review on
[SPEAKER_03]: the methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start calling it certifications,
and you enable people to edit the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: names of the strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have a shit show in your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't believe anything that comes
out of that system because the methods
[SPEAKER_03]: behind it have never made it through peer
review.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think they will because
there's many papers that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: published warning against doing this exact
thing, that you really cannot do single
[SPEAKER_03]: amplicon variants, and you really
shouldn't do it in polymorphic genomes
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're going to get all types of
reference bias when you do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's the reason why their
methods aren't peer reviewed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the other parties who have arguably
been working off of less funding than they
[SPEAKER_03]: have have gotten papers out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see Nolan Kane published one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We submitted some data to that paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Hill put data in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary Jean put data in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen Philippe Henry put some things
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen Anandia publishes all the time
on their methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost every other genetic provider out
there has their methods published.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soilr is another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can review whether or not
there's any artifacts going on in the
[SPEAKER_03]: data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this leads me to what I'm most
concerned about is that why did they hold
[SPEAKER_03]: the data back for so long?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were they that understaffed that they
couldn't put the data public?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is hard to put data in NCBI.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can take a whole day to have a
bioinformatics person get burnt up putting
[SPEAKER_03]: that data into NCBI.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't take two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are the data they have?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were talking about a 50k SNP array
from Illumina quite publicly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, their assay only sequenced a couple
thousand SNPs, one to two thousand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did they design the 50k SNP array
if they were only surveying two thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: SNPs in everyone's samples they sent in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did they design the other 48,000
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they probably had to sequence more
territory in everyone's sample to
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligently design that chip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the chip is unintelligently designed
and it's perhaps not a very good breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those two things is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does lead you to question how much
have they been putting public and how much
[SPEAKER_03]: have they been keeping private?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what type of advantage does that
necessarily give them in a breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: program?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are open questions I don't think
anyone has the answer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are actually really good questions
to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great broad question but it's
very applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin, will this data hurt or help
cannabis in the long term in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily phylosis, what they're
doing, but overall the breeding using
[SPEAKER_00]: these tools in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the tools will help.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think we need a chapter out of the
cryptography crypto space here of
[SPEAKER_03]: decentralizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Putting all of the data in one honeypot
database where, let's be frank,
[SPEAKER_03]: the security policy there was not very
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if people have seen the
threads, but it was burping out admin
[SPEAKER_03]: password throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got it and we're their competitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the last people that should get
their admin password, but it ended up on
[SPEAKER_03]: our screen one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means you have a collection of
everyone's data where the customers don't
[SPEAKER_03]: get to see the data for two years,
but the people who got that admin password
[SPEAKER_03]: probably did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the worst possible scenario for
getting a prior art is you held it from
[SPEAKER_03]: the people who paid you for it and yet you
were sloppy with the keys and let other
[SPEAKER_03]: people get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not a prior art system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't quite recognize that password
until I went back and looked at that after
[SPEAKER_03]: all this went down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wait a minute, let me look at
that email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, for those who know the password
that it burped out, I don't know if it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: real password or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was many years ago and I never
put this stuff public because it's bad
[SPEAKER_03]: policy to put someone else's passwords
public, but it was been two years and I
[SPEAKER_03]: gave it to Mowgli privately and I'm
assuming he went and changed all those
[SPEAKER_03]: things the next day when he realized his
competitor had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't, I'm sorry, but that's a bad
policy for you not to change it after I
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in that list was the password was
autofloweraleel and I think someone else
[SPEAKER_03]: in the thread may have been some grown
mids pointed out that the username was
[SPEAKER_03]: forge, like forgery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, those are bad names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not great names.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they say we weren't looking for
anything in your data, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, that wouldn't be, you may have,
Helen Kenler would have been a better
[SPEAKER_03]: name, you know, not autofloweraleel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty revealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that's speculative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get involved in too much
speculation, but I don't think I need to
[SPEAKER_03]: speculate because the videos that were put
out pretty much show the Jekyll and Hyde
[SPEAKER_03]: of this, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the investor side of the story,
which this data is extraordinarily
[SPEAKER_03]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to rule the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the customer side saying
the data is all garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those two, you can't square that circle
very easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that video does, you know,
it is basically the nail in the coffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing I've been saying this
whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people come to me for dirt on
phylos or whatever, because I've been,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been researching them for a long time
and had it out with them several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact of the matter is I don't even
have to say anything from my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just show what they say and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I've left it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's been damaging enough,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I mean, it would have been
nice to have everything on the up and up
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been ideal, but it's not,
it's not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what you're saying about
decentralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously that's, that's the goal for,
for having a company that's successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so there's maybe two things to
consider is, you know, I've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: growers like that are early on and they
don't want to buy all their own sequencers
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they're either outsourced
to us or other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some will even go to their local
universities because it's unlikely
[SPEAKER_03]: university is going to turn around and
breed on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they'll get to universities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to build tools that some
of the universities could run that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're not necessarily the data
hoarding risk that people may consider
[SPEAKER_03]: because we understand after this went
down, no one's going to trust anybody to
[SPEAKER_03]: sequence their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but we hope we can convince you
that these blockchains work, but half the
[SPEAKER_03]: time when we tell people about
blockchains, their eyes glaze over and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, I don't get it, go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we understand that's not going to
satisfy everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to start building tools
that may assist universities to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: sequence for you, because frankly,
they're going to have a big learning
[SPEAKER_03]: curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you went to one today and said,
here's my DNA, they're going to stumble on
[SPEAKER_03]: whether they can take it in or not on
whether it violates any of their federal
[SPEAKER_03]: grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they get past that hurdle,
they're going to, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: stumbling on the fact that they've never
sequenced this genome before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very hard to sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of that worked out into
kits where they could run these kits onto
[SPEAKER_03]: their sequencers and get data that's very
similar to other data that's been,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's been made before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they could compare it,
excuse me, to canapedia data.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest challenge we've had in PT
testing and cannabis genomics is that for
[SPEAKER_03]: the first few years of this, every service
provider was running, was sequencing a
[SPEAKER_03]: different part of the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really difficult to cross compare
everyone's data because you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: covering, you're not sequencing the same
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: About two years ago, we changed that and
we downloaded the phylos data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We downloaded the cane data and the soiler
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we built a panel that covers at
least 50 snips and all of those things so
[SPEAKER_03]: that we could try to triangulate,
you know, if you sequence on our panel,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can figure out what it's closest to in
all the other data sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're, we're looking into ways to
enable a lot of the other universities to
[SPEAKER_03]: pick this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way it's somewhat decentralized.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't like the university in your
state, maybe you send it to another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it doesn't become this
surveillance capitalism approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: In most other markets, sequencing is very
commoditized.
[SPEAKER_03]: There isn't this window for someone to do
this because you can shop around for
[SPEAKER_03]: sequencing providers and therefore they
don't get to collect large hordes of your
[SPEAKER_03]: data.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send one strain to one place and
one to another and one to another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this means the aggregation of that
data doesn't fall into one person's hands
[SPEAKER_03]: who can be co-opted to sell it to a party
you're not thrilled with.
[SPEAKER_03]: That does lead me to a couple of points
people should be aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sequencing test that the people have
been running at Philos is the most
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive sequencing per base I think of
any test in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only getting 300,000 letters out of
this for about $285.
[SPEAKER_03]: To put that in perspective, and you might
get 2,000 snips, one to 2,000 snips.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 23andMe test you get for like 99 bucks
or surveying one to like 5 million snips,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is, this is a complete rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you're giving them data to
potentially be sold is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the data they're putting public
I don't think is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really the fact that they have the
genomic DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got presentations out that are
public now that demonstrate them cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: picking 99 samples out of the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have this structure thing that tells
you whether it's like berry or I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: remember all the names.
[SPEAKER_03]: They categorize things into six buckets
and those buckets are somewhat fictitious
[SPEAKER_03]: based on what you tell the program to look
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give it a value as to how many
populations you think are there and it
[SPEAKER_03]: spits out it's like a consultant that
tells you what time it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's six populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives you a pretty picture with six
populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, they use that data to cherry
pick 99 samples they're gonna do whole
[SPEAKER_03]: genome sequencing on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they say they're not using the
galaxy to do the breeding program,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that project right there begins to
blur that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're using the galaxy to figure out what
to sequence to really extreme depth to
[SPEAKER_03]: start your breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that to me looks as if it is utilizing
the data for the breeding program and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's been publicly presented.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have publicly presented that
they're looking for the BTBD allele,
[SPEAKER_03]: the CBD allele, which is already out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seth Crawford's already bought it and used
our kit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a marker that tracks that and we
didn't turn that into a breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We turned that into a kit that anyone
could buy and any breeder could use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's done it successfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't know how to do it successfully
because I don't know how to breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's managed to know if I can track
which samples do not have any CBD alleles
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'd start with type three plants and
they're all CBD negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means they're probably type four or
type five.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're one of those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was able to figure that out with
the orange photonics that it was in fact a
[SPEAKER_03]: type four and move on with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nevertheless, they're picking samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where they got the samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question I can't answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have them listed in some of these
presentations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They may have sourced them from
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're clearly hunting for markers
for the breeding program and it looks as
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's being guided by their historical
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good one and I know you briefly
touched on it and you can choose to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: it or not because it is kind of a personal
opinion question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referring to what Bodhi asked the
other night about Chimera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some data on Chimera because I know a lot
of us like I grew up like that was
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera, Watson and Clark were the end all
be all when it came to breeding and slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years you learn things and you
realize they may not be who I hope they
[SPEAKER_00]: would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to say the first three people
that contacted me after we put chem dog
[SPEAKER_03]: public in 2011 were those three people in
that exact order.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met and I met Robert Clark and Dave
Watson.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're nice enough to host me over there
in Amsterdam and show me around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never came to any agreement on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they wanted to do something like
Phyllis back then but we weren't funded
[SPEAKER_03]: and that was early.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the laws in the United States
weren't really favorable at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of put M.G.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: on ice for a little bit while we waited
for the coal memo to get more clarity on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so I spent a lot of time with Ryan Lee
at a lot of the ICRS meetings and I've had
[SPEAKER_03]: a great time with him in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm an asshole online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just pissed him off online and he's
black.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's he is one of the people that
convinced me to back off on Phyllis.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact he got me to apologize to them at
an Emerald Cup a couple of years ago for
[SPEAKER_03]: calling them out on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 2016 there's a lot of news on our
Facebook site and arguably back then it
[SPEAKER_03]: was not as we didn't have the videos you
have now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had information from people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I had the history of seeing genomic
companies get built.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what always happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was naturally suspicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I saw that they weren't putting
any data public but telling everybody that
[SPEAKER_03]: they were saving them from insomniac by
putting a star on the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: A star on the galaxy doesn't give you any
prior art.
[SPEAKER_03]: The USPTO can't do shit with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the patents they issue they
talk about the BTBD allele which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: genotype and they talk about chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two languages the USPTO uses
to evaluate strains right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might change.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might get broader in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the the precedence that's been set
with the biotech LLC patent is that you
[SPEAKER_03]: need a genotype and a chemotype for you
for us to understand what it is you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some lawyers that may have better
information on this than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reggie might be a good person or Dale Hunt
might be a good person to talk to on this
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're more versed in some of
what's allowable there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so we made a noise and we probably
weren't polite about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of people kind of yelled at us
about it and convinced us to kind of shut
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're you're being a bad community member
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have enough hard data on this
and you're being paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then over time we see after we
apologize I should say I apologize to
[SPEAKER_03]: Mowgli about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the behavior didn't change.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put out 845 samples a couple of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another two years went by and
nothing else showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like well I thought we came to
agreement that if you're going to be open
[SPEAKER_03]: about this you had to be open and not use
the cover of the OCP to act like you're
[SPEAKER_03]: open when you're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that's what kind of triggered us
to get back involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw this go down like oh god we're kind
of complicit in this because we were
[SPEAKER_03]: barking about it a few years ago and then
we backed off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now look what's happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so yeah I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to say I really can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been in this space long enough
to really weigh in on those three
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals and where they can of a space.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know I know Ryan's had some
fingerprints on the biotech LLC stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: so he's generally been sort of supportive
of patents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not anti-patent either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I generally think they're evil but I think
they exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because they exist if you put your
head in the sand over the rules of that
[SPEAKER_03]: game you're going to get screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to learn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got to play the game at least
offensively.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have enough money you might be
able to afford the offensive tracks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of companies many years ago were
so new in the space they couldn't afford
[SPEAKER_03]: the offensive tracks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Offensive tracks can also be 20 to 30
grand a patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can probably get the provisionals like
chucked in for a couple of grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a year later or 18 months later you're
going to be held to make a decision on
[SPEAKER_03]: whether you're going to go full boat on
this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are going to cost you more like
20 grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So defensive IP seemed to be the cheap way
to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we tried to enable with
Canapedia was get things on blockchains
[SPEAKER_03]: get things public so you at least don't
get submarine by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can at least say my shit existed here
and it's not some bullshit site that might
[SPEAKER_03]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually we've got something on an
immutable ledger that seems to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: financial reason to exist for a long
period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the site's not going to go down and my
prior art's not going to disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the biggest issue the USPTO
has in the cannabis space is the sites go
[SPEAKER_03]: down because there's all the censorship on
the Internet over cannabis sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can put your stuff online and
find it get wiped out by Facebook or
[SPEAKER_03]: something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you no longer have your prior
art.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need these tools that that are
immutable to survive all the censorship
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great answer about camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and it's just based on your
opinion and your brief interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This smart guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned a lot from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned a ton from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know it's not not to be encouraging
there but everyone gets different
[SPEAKER_03]: interests and sometimes these these
conflicts make us go different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If plants aren't patentable then who has
the prior art.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plants are patentable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately I'm not saying this as a
supporter of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact if anyone wants to watch a very
good review on IP I'd encourage people to
[SPEAKER_03]: look at Stephen Kinsella's work on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a patent attorney who hates IP and so
he's got a very refreshing perspective but
[SPEAKER_03]: he also is very legit about it and that
look they exist and if you don't play by
[SPEAKER_03]: these rules you're you're exposed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can be as anti patent as you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you put your head in the sand
you're probably going to lose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to respect the fact that the
law is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of different ways you can
patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact the best way I think that may have
just emerged yesterday is the USDA just
[SPEAKER_03]: opened up its doors to take in cannabis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is that might be the best
protection I think growers can get right
[SPEAKER_03]: now because I don't think phylos has
stabilized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got to say they're they're they
just turn into breeding and to breed if
[SPEAKER_03]: they get cultivars in from other people
that agree to license them to them they
[SPEAKER_03]: then need to probably cross them and
change them a little bit so that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll take a couple of cycles and then
you got to back cross those so that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the USDA does is I think they
want like three thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of seeds and they check them
for whether they are in fact stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop a few and see if they're really stream
and phenotype and if they are they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: consider it a viable PPP.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is Plant Variety Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one there is there are plant
patents which are their own class of
[SPEAKER_03]: patents but those patents are for a
sexually reproduced material clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are utility patents which
are the broadest patents which are the
[SPEAKER_03]: patents that we saw biotic LC get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those can be very expensive to
unravel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the patent is issued you need to do
an ex parte re-exam which can be a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred grand to try and invalidate a
patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that creates a different
financial dynamic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we've we've put some data public that
may challenge it and may not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm not a lawyer on that but the
Jamaican Lion project we did we did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One we needed a type two plant to sequence
and two we tried to find something that
[SPEAKER_03]: predated the patent and build the best
forensics back to that date.
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular strain won a cannabis cup
in San Francisco in 2011 and has been
[SPEAKER_03]: known to be a type two plant that
sometimes is is is beta carotene dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes mercy dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one area I think at the USPTO.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Reggie's trying to help educate
them and others need to educate them is
[SPEAKER_03]: that this concept of using terpenes as a
fingerprint for strain is really dangerous
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not really a fingerprint it's
an environmental signature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that means you could have the
same plan and put it somewhere else and
[SPEAKER_03]: get a terpenes or you can have a
completely different plant that's
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically distinct has a different
cannabinoid profile but still gives you
[SPEAKER_03]: you can tweak it to pop mercine or pop
beta care depending on how you how you
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't like those as I think those are
very broad and very dangerous because when
[SPEAKER_03]: you get something that says I have I own
all types of plants that don't have mercy
[SPEAKER_03]: as as a dominant terpene you suddenly own
way way way too much property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's not clear to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Mark does great reading and great
work and I don't doubt that that guy can
[SPEAKER_03]: breed good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's more that that the scope of
claims there's there's a ratchet effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always get bigger they never get
smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a good lawyer is going to take that
patent and try and broaden it even more
[SPEAKER_03]: and broaden even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen it get pushed back in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a there's a there's a collection
up there of probably LPs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know who's behind it but
there's a group of people up there funding
[SPEAKER_03]: in opposition to the patent up there and
they managed to narrow the claims going
[SPEAKER_03]: into Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the claim on that patent is enforced in
Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's small.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more narrow than it is here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a here's another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just just so people know as far
as as far as being stable phenotypically
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis that is a rare thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: IBL is very hard to apply to in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very there are very few strains that
have less than three phenotypes if any.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not surprised when I look at the
variation in the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean this is a it's a quite diverse
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to find other species that can
be it's almost it's not quite there but
[SPEAKER_03]: it's pretty close.
[SPEAKER_03]: One step every 94 bases is almost like
having chimpanzees and humans being able
[SPEAKER_03]: to cross and still have productive
offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that you get a spectrum of
phenotypes in any one plant you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most homozygous plants we've seen came
from Franco and those are those were land
[SPEAKER_03]: races.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there may be some controversy about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't source them but I think he got
him out of the Congo and there's some bio
[SPEAKER_03]: piracy concerns there that I'm not really
attuned to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's he shipped us a few from there
and those those things are the most
[SPEAKER_03]: homozygous things we've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe those will be stable and give you
seeds that are all near clonal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think until we get APO mixes worked
out we're going to be we're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point someone's going to figure
out how to make double haploid cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: and the whole thing is going to go seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one regarding defensive IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe open source breeding is
practical affordable and common standard
[SPEAKER_00]: for small breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it depends on what's affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you might hear Dale Hunt may have
a different opinion on this because you
[SPEAKER_03]: can file provisional very cheaply and
maybe that's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can decide after the term of the
provisional is up to say screw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go open with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't afford to go any further.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really comes down to whether you
use PTO is going to be effective at their
[SPEAKER_03]: job looking through the prior art.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's and that's my concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having been involved in the past long time
and people can call me hypocrites up and I
[SPEAKER_03]: have a lot of patents in my name from all
the stuff that I've done and my experience
[SPEAKER_03]: using the patent office is one that makes
me very disgruntled about it because the
[SPEAKER_03]: USPTO doesn't have a financial incentive
to do the preliminary search report
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make just as much money on the exams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't really care if they issue a
broad patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market's going to sue over it later
and then they'll get more revenue when the
[SPEAKER_03]: reason happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the incentives there aren't right for
them to do very thorough preliminary
[SPEAKER_03]: search reports.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really have to kind of put it if
you're going to go and put it open you got
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure it's open and obvious and in
their face and they can't miss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it you know publish the data in
multiple places so that it's found and
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have a mechanism for whatever is
indexing the the Internet to find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the Google has to be if you're
putting this stuff up like on the IPFS
[SPEAKER_03]: Google doesn't crawl that and we'll never
find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great place to store some data but it's
not it's not going to be found by the
[SPEAKER_03]: USPTO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what else do we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask you what's your experience with
cannabis as far as personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something you've been interested
in prior to the genetic aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got introduced to cannabis in seventh
grade a long long time ago and then I took
[SPEAKER_03]: a big hiatus from it when I got my first
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just it was a human genome project.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was afraid I was going to get tested
and get chucked off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so I was probably away for it until
2010 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of friends of ours were getting
cancer in their mid 30s and 40s and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone was like what the hell is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were we were building DNA
sequencers at the time that could sequence
[SPEAKER_03]: the tumor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sequence the patient figure out what
drugable mutation they actually had in the
[SPEAKER_03]: tumor.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is they they then would turn
to a set of toolboxes like cisplatin and
[SPEAKER_03]: all this poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have this wonderful targeted
approach of nailing the tumor and Achilles
[SPEAKER_03]: heel but the selection of drugs you had
all sucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when people started forwarding
me cannabinoid papers saying what about
[SPEAKER_03]: these.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are nontoxic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I really dove back in into
it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then every time I think we started
getting cold feet about that business
[SPEAKER_03]: model someone in our family would get sick
that would benefit from it and would
[SPEAKER_03]: reenrage us into doing more.
[SPEAKER_03]: My father's one my father's had type.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's had stage four cancer for four years
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been fighting and it's a prostate
cancer that went to the bones that went
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that's dealt with his pain
has been type two plants and very similar
[SPEAKER_03]: to actually what was patented.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing that kind of got me
into the Jamaican Lion project is like
[SPEAKER_03]: look this is a case is helping cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really close to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not tolerating this that someone owns
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that needs to be public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so fortunately Dash funded that and
they funded it in a way where it went
[SPEAKER_03]: public more or less two or three days
after the assembly was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even have a chance to really
look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see it put it public and we've
since been combing through the data to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out what we can learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the right model is get
get we need to float all boats right now
[SPEAKER_03]: having this cartelized everyone having
their own private cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we really want to accelerate the
field we need good references out there
[SPEAKER_03]: that everyone can utilize even our
competitors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm certain file this is probably use
the Jamaican Lion thing further making
[SPEAKER_03]: their 50 K chips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the timing of that would have been
perfect for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The we've seen others published already.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's someone some groups done a
cannabis proteome off of the Jamaican Lion
[SPEAKER_03]: reference we put forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's in bio archive right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really interesting read.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my history has been on and off.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've seen CBD help tremendously and
arrhythmias as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of a fib in the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this actually affected my brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a there's actually an ICRS
presentation I gave on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: His actual case was really fascinating
because we sequence the genomes are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: family and figured out he has two
different calcium channel mutations one
[SPEAKER_03]: for my mother one for my father.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got debilitating a fib.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing that nails it is CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if it's big there's like six
million people in countries a fib.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think it works on all if he's
got a very private.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those variants aren't known to any any
other database but him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're very rare variants ones in our
wire to gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my sister is an electro cardiologist
and she was afraid to basically ablate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like I don't I can't match this
arrhythmia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't want to burn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to do something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so CBD came to the rescue for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been this consistent theme in
our family where this plant keeps pulling
[SPEAKER_03]: us back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you were my family because we've
had some cancer things go on and no one
[SPEAKER_00]: was anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's oh you know the craziest thing
about my father's story is his I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize this or put the put two and two
together on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were we were flying back into
like a hospice care scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the nurses are constantly asking
what's his birthday what's his birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kept telling them well it's October
1st 1937 October 1st 1937.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like what the hell I know that
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is that date from.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that's that's the date they made
cannabis illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was born on that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird cosmic shit like that that
makes you go all right I think I have to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I think that's awesome that
you actually have a personal connection
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seriously lacking in any kind of
corporate world or testing world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well this is what motivated us to do
CanMed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we run that conference every year
and it's it we have CME credits there
[SPEAKER_03]: because our interest was like we need more
doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we when we initially got in this
field it was hard to find a doctor that
[SPEAKER_03]: would certify him.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were in Massachusetts and we're way
behind right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he lived in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even you know live free and dies what
I call it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of these states where their their
their cannabis regs are way behind
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he had to have two doctors sign off
and had to know them for like three to six
[SPEAKER_03]: months or something like that in New
Hampshire for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get cannabis in New Hampshire and
we're like that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we figured out something where a main
certificate would work in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a big run around for someone
who's got stage four cancer to be like oh
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know no I'm not going to wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So CanMed helps get more doctors
certified.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we try to get everyone to present
on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all science based.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean we invite Mark there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Lewis does great work even though we
don't agree with his patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe he does great science and so we
welcome him in to present what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd welcome Ryan Lee too if he has work to
present.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about if you present good work we
try to keep the politics and the business
[SPEAKER_03]: conflicts out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running out of time but that went
really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly I thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came like at a really odd time in the
business where you know all this just
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and snowballed and it took some
big nuts to come and just you know take
[SPEAKER_00]: questions firing them at you and we all
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everyone online that's
chipped in on this because it is hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: These folks do a lot of money and they
could get litigious over calling this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know it's stronger when everyone
can share data and see what the truth
[SPEAKER_03]: really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard if you're just one voice
and you know you don't want to bank your
[SPEAKER_03]: entire reputation on it unless you see
other people saying you know they can
[SPEAKER_03]: corroborate the data and it looks like
other people did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really did their homework on this and
figured out what was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: To a much higher degree than we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're probably going to put this on
YouTube if that's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a permanent home so people can
see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have time in the future I'd
love to have you back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like this is a lot of data to throw
at people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know people are going to be watching
this re-watching this and have more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah we get the discussion going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still really intrigued on where this
goes whether it goes open or closed and
[SPEAKER_03]: what what's this is all going to turn into
because I don't think we have clear
[SPEAKER_03]: answers but we're a tool provider.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we necessarily need them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need to be transparent and make
sure people understand what we do with
[SPEAKER_03]: people's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I think that's the most important
thing is transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all people ask really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be straightforward and honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No it's amazing actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much harder to actually be a liar
because it's too hard to trip up on
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And truth makes it really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to remember anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well thank you so much brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a wonderful night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if I didn't get to everyone's
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have them back on if you'll
come back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of data there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of heavy science.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm even trying to process right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I mean it was hard science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have to go research a
bunch of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does take a lot of nuts to come on
here and be face to face with someone like
[SPEAKER_00]: me that's going to not pulley punches per
se.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate him doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know go go research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go research everything that he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find something incorrect let me
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll bring it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the fact that he's made
himself so available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to trust people that are
cannabis outsiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it looks like at least it
appears that his heart is in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think someone recorded this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope someone recorded this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did I think Flavnel is going to
record this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me the link when you get it up and
I'll put it up on the YouTube as well on
[SPEAKER_00]: the YouTubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yep that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
Cheers.
