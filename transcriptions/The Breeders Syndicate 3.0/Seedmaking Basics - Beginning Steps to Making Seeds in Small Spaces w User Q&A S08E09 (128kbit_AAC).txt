[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_00]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_00]: Noxodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_00]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew and I'm here with my host
Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're going to be talking about
making seeds in small spaces and home
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the past, Matt, you and Noxodon have
tended to focus on commercial breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: the conditions of the breeding industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while certainly tips and techniques
have been shared, like you guys have
[SPEAKER_02]: peppered them amongst your anecdotes and
responses, I think it's definitely a good
[SPEAKER_02]: time to have an episode dedicated to
practicalities of seed making and breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit, especially for the people at
home or in smaller spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what we've done is more specific
to people that have already maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: memorized marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already more advanced, what we talk
about in the techniques and specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people have talked about like
they would like something more basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a quick intro on just seed making in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the basics have been totally
skipped over, left out, and there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really anyone covering them or in one
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this will be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think without further ado,
I think we can start making seeds with
[SPEAKER_02]: regular plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the first distinction I wanted
to make was obviously before you get into
[SPEAKER_02]: something like this, there's a little bit
of planning involved because there are
[SPEAKER_02]: timing constraints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for some people, it's about lining up
their males and females so that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: both ready at the right time, like that
the pollen donors are ready and that the
[SPEAKER_02]: females are ready to receive at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's another group of people
who are interested in collecting pollen,
[SPEAKER_02]: storing it, what it takes to store and
retain viability on the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe the first question is how do you
stagger males and females if you're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to line them up?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the questions we have is
actually from Lili from our Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lili is wanting to do an open
pollination on some of those AK packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not want to collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not want to dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to let it rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, how would they stagger males and
females?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to stagger males and
females, the only time that really needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be done or considered is if you're
crossing like a short flowering female to
[SPEAKER_00]: a long flowering male, say, or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, males will flower and
there's not really any staggering needed
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's the same exact strain and they're
all flowering at about the same exact
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time it really needs to happen is
when you've got an Afghani type,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, female and like a haze male,
you know, or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say a haze female and an Afghani
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghani male will be done flowering,
you know, eight to nine weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas that haze male or the haze female
might not even start flowering until like
[SPEAKER_00]: week seven to where there's any kind of
stigmatic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only time it really needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be taken into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staggering is usually a feminized breeding
technique that comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's cool because you answered a
second question, which was from Little
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin in the Hood, who was talking about
how do you deal with long flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the approach to staggering still the
same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you can sort of answer that,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean,
you have to know it's a lot harder when
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know the lines that you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just like making crosses to see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to stagger because you don't know
exactly at what point the female or male,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it whatever case it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know when it's going to start
flowering and when it's going to end
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and producing whatever you need
it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does help to have some kind of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know roughly how long it flowers
and trying to go off, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed making seed makers descriptions on
flowering can be really hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to cross two totally
different types and don't really know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend a run without doing it just
to see how long they flower so that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not wasting and wanting a whole run on one
you can't use or, you know, just a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: miss that you have to wait till next
round.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I need a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, great advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now in terms of the people who are
interested in perhaps collecting and then
[SPEAKER_02]: storing pollen, I guess the first question
is, you know, when do you collect?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you collect to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is use what people
call trim bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be called pollen collectors,
I think back in the day, but essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: it's what people have or it's a bin and
then on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another bin that sits
inside it, but they screen on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially people will trim over it
and the tricums fall and suppose,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you scrape it with the hash in
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with males, what we like to do is let
them hang over the edge, kind of roll it,
[SPEAKER_00]: gently roll them over the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I like using this method is
because the petals of the male don't fall
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the pollen below the actual
powder, the actual pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you collect it, you're not having
to scrape out a whole lot of male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you might see one or two that you
have to pick out because when you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: then store this pollen, you don't have
male parts with a bunch of moisture and
[SPEAKER_00]: then damaging the pollen or molding and
essentially killing the pollen when you
[SPEAKER_00]: store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the best method I found for
collecting pollen and, and screening it
[SPEAKER_00]: all in one, like in one fell swoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you know, you can collect it
and then you've got to sift out the male
[SPEAKER_00]: parts slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all, there's all sorts of ways
people have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, you know, putting bags
around males once they're ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect, you know, put a big bag around a
branch and tie it off and beat it around
[SPEAKER_00]: till they got it, you know, take that,
dump that on some kind of string,
[SPEAKER_00]: sift it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of different ways people
have done it, but the best method for me
[SPEAKER_00]: is that method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll actually come back to some of
those questions about like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: bagging branches and stuff and,
or bagging, you know, isolating the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of, in terms of timing,
when, when do you collect the pollen?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just when the sacs are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you want to have, so when you flower
a male, you'll notice that certain sacs
[SPEAKER_00]: will open early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is like breeding theory on,
and I think some of it is just like based
[SPEAKER_00]: on experience as opposed to scientific
theory on, in cannabis on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen that opens the earliest is a
different color than the pollen that opens
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's theories that the more
mature pollen is so much better to use
[SPEAKER_00]: than the earlier flowering, less mature
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never noticed a major difference in
all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually any pollen that starts dropping,
I collect into the trim bin and slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: collect it over time and then sift it all
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people are very fastidious and
say like, oh no, I only collect it after a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other stuff I just let drop,
you know, don't collect it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never had really any issues with
that or seen any notable difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So earlier, I think you, you, you
mentioned that moisture obviously is one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the key things you try to avoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in terms of storing pollen for it
to remain viable for as long as possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what are your suggestions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Morass was asking, yeah, how do you
store it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long can pollen remain viable for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I cut with corn flour like some
people recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like cutting with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't see a reason to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think that it like weighs down
the pollen, makes it all better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I, you know, there's all sorts of
different reasons people cut pollen that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard over the years, but I've never
found a good reason for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with pollen storage, I also don't have
a super good answer on how long it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: viable because I've seen it stay viable a
year without being stored and just living
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, like air vents in a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've also seen people intentionally
store it really well in a freezer and a
[SPEAKER_00]: month later it's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's without any kind of visual
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to say there's no
guarantees when it comes to pollen run on
[SPEAKER_00]: how long it'll stay viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no guarantees on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, me and, uh, a few other breeders in
our group, um, don't like to store pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place, because when we go to
use it, we've had so many bad experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years with like just it not
taking or not being as consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, after it sits for a month,
that it's not really worth storing over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have really great
recommendations other than to say the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've tried it and that, you know,
making sure all of the petals,
[SPEAKER_00]: like whether people realize it or not,
there are petals on the male flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it real close, it's a,
it's a male flower, you know, that hangs
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The petals are, are opened up and that's
what the stuff falls out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's little parts that open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a part of the petals and we do not
collect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like one of the most important
things that I see most errors made are
[SPEAKER_00]: that people wet pedals and they're pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when they scrape it up and you could
put it in like a black film can tannister,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the old, um, photography film
canisters are perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anything dark, you don't want any
light getting to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light destroys pollen and moisture
destroys pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you know, you put it in that seal
it up, put it in a freezer, put it inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of two, you know, freezer bag,
tight, uh, Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please throw that in the freezer and,
um, roll your dice is about your best bet
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to pollen storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've seen people sell it and
I've also heard nightmares about the
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've bought, sold pollen that's been
stored X amount of months, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sent by a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're going to do that,
just beware pollen, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a recent thing, people selling
pollen or is that, no, it's been going for
[SPEAKER_02]: a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the past, maybe three or four
years I started, started seeing it pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just, cause most people know like
that have been making seeds, how unviable
[SPEAKER_00]: stored pollen can be and how
unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't really like a market,
but now that more people are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds and don't really have any
knowledge about it, they're more
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to buying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've seen, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's just like another,
yeah, another kind of, uh, ploy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I guess, well, just while we're
talking about, uh, storing pollen and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that, and you kind of mentioned,
obviously you've had quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you have any, do you have any
funny stories about story pollen or like
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen fails or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've seen, I've seen, I've seen pollen
cut with cornstarch and have weevils pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I'd like, I just,
mostly the stories are like pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to dust it and you know,
it's, it's something you're really relying
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of times when we would store
pollen, it would be feminized pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse pollen because one it's a pain in
the ass to do two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never assured that it's going to drop
no matter what spray you're using or
[SPEAKER_00]: technique you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never assured it's going to drop
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never assured it's going to be
viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get it, you know, it's viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you treat that like gold
and want to store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is like, when we've gone
back and used it, we have to wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, four days a week to see if it
took.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually that's during prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dusting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get into what prime dusting time
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that doesn't take, then you're also
back a week on prime dusting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to either hope that you have
other pollen somewhere, another,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plan B or your crop is now going
to be since the Mia that's been dusted by
[SPEAKER_00]: unviable pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't want to smoke,
you know, it's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, some people say they smoke
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard the other day about someone saying
that they got, I think it was the Zomia
[SPEAKER_00]: guy was talking about some guy gets the
pollen and puts it in his mouth and like
[SPEAKER_00]: uses it like medicine, like choose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think someone was joking in the
server the other day about getting,
[SPEAKER_02]: tricking people and doing lines of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was on CSI's post when I was
trying to tell people they should do
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me trying to trick people into
doing lines of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that done too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the most hideous, horrid,
like sinus infection you can ever get is
[SPEAKER_00]: snorting pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids at home don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not snort pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no drugs in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, it's just going to make you
sneeze a lot and probably give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The post in reference to it was CSI
asking, he's heard about people smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: their mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you people think about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, everybody knows that you snort
the mails and only dummies smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, there were people chiming in
saying, yeah, I always smoke my mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're heady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I get that there are resin
glands on some mails, not in prodigious
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have them in prodigious amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tend to think those are more
intersex type mails and not mails that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd want to be using anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ones that have some resin,
I guess maybe people can smoke like the
[SPEAKER_00]: those petals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't imagine smoking pollen for any
reason at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I know we're not really
going to talk so much about selections
[SPEAKER_02]: today, but it is interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole process is like, because it's so
opaque, people have to, people come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with like all kinds of strange,
like, almost like divinatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is trying to make their selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I cast my runes and yeah,
I mean, because you have to start
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere and there's no real defined way
to start because you don't know what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have until you run the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really all that boils down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have come up with all these
methods they think are voodoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, you know, like read the
bones, read the stars, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming back to this process of making
seeds and you already, you already
[SPEAKER_02]: gestures towards this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you, when do you want to pollinate
your females and how?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good, good one to use,
like a rule of thumb for all females,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter when they're flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pollinate them when,
when their hairs are the most white,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had the most white hairs
everywhere is when you want to pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second you see the hair start to die
off, that is a non receivable point for
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that hair can no longer receive
pollen and trans, you know, transport the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed into the ovule or whatever's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the technicality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make it seem more human,
but that's not really what's happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, that's, that's, that's
technically what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hair receives a pollen, the pollen
grain, pollinates the embryo right here
[SPEAKER_00]: forms in the bract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, um, so if the hair's
dead, it can't receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore that bract cannot make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want it to be where the ultimately
where it has the most white hairs living
[SPEAKER_00]: without any died off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the perfect point for pollination
at all times, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that can be it 13 weeks flower,
you know, Malawi's hazes, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sometimes it could be at 20 weeks
flower on some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it can be week five,
week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it really just depends on the line
you're running, but overall the rule of
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb is the most white hairs,
the least amount of brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of like the actual method of
pollination, like I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we, uh, obviously, you know,
you can just have your plants in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: room, your males and females, and just let
them go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess, uh, some of these questions
are more about uh, for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_02]: term, like partial or isolated pollination
techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so Dudeness mentioned, yeah,
small pollen runs and applying with
[SPEAKER_02]: brushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morass was like, yeah, you know,
pollinate, can you pollinate one branch
[SPEAKER_02]: and let the rest of the plant flower,
you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, can you, Abu's even was like,
Oh, can you, can you brush, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, what are the risks
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, variety of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have questions about brushing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the logic of this, the logic of this is
presupposing that you have a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite and distant storage place for
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're doing isolated
pollinations, you do not want any chance
[SPEAKER_00]: for any of these males to flower in the
same building as your, your receivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that also kind of,
um, gets down to pollen isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we want to talk about that
first, maybe before we discuss that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I thought maybe we would have a
whole section on the different isolation
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe here you're just going to
broad stroke, but I don't know if that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pollen isolation methods,
there is no good pollen isolation method
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a broad stroke of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're going to try to do isolated
pollinations in a small environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't, if all you have is,
if all you have is like a tent or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even two tents in the same house,
even if they're across the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be very hard to pull off a plant
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking about like a house with
central air, maybe pull off a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and, and a male flowering
because pollen is so fine and so light and
[SPEAKER_00]: travel so microscopically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it is very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always go back to this case in
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my blue bonnet pollinations at a
big, at like a 5,000 square foot house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the back is where I did the
pollination of the furthest back room you
[SPEAKER_00]: could possibly do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in the front of this place,
I had a whole nother room isolated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: big tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, okay, so I did the
pollination and this is, I did the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnet pollination a year prior,
a year, a whole fricking year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did it open in that back bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next one I was going to do in a
tent and I wasn't doing a pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to do a sense of Miller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that run inside of a tent with a
carbon scrubber on the outside still got
[SPEAKER_00]: blue bonnet pollen from a year prior from
the, uh, the air vents and ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only place he didn't clean was my,
my central air got pollinated like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a decent pollination of, of a tent
separated with the carbon scrubber inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the same house in a completely separate
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for an example, that's how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't just kind of pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was enough to do, it was enough to get
a look inside stuff like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 500 seeds of plant, like a lot,
um, not a lot, but I mean, enough to where
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't just a grain here or a grain
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a serious contamination and it
would ruin a sense of Miller room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so when trying to do like these
isolated pollen runs, it is best if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have some way to store your mail at a
completely different location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only time I would say I
would attempt any kind of isolated pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually we have a bunch of different
questions on like different possible ways
[SPEAKER_02]: of isolating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we actually will come back to
this, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for now, why don't we just assume we
have some pollen?
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't, we won't mention how,
but pollen for now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And given, and if we skip the
contamination issue, if you have some
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen and you did want to say,
try to just do one branch or like
[SPEAKER_02]: different branches with different kinds of
pollen, like how well does that work in
[SPEAKER_02]: and of itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, yeah, people have done it very
effectively over the years, as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the males were kept separate and
introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one by one, a lot of times what
people will do instead of just,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's a few techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the bagging technique,
a bagging technique, a, which would be to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bag and a lot of, they make pollen
bags specifically for this to let air
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe, but not if they're, they're so
tight that the pollen can't escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's supposedly the theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't ever used these things,
but that's, that's how they supposedly
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, I've seen it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you put this over the branch that,
that you're wanting to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you insert the branch into this bag,
you tie it off and then you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: agitate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you, you, you let that sit a
few days, you take it off, you blow down
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant with some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to mold the plant,
obviously, but you want to wash it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pollen isn't viable in hitting
other branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the theory of washing it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, that's one method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another method is to tie off all branches
and then do that one branch, undo it,
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it off with water, and then undo all
the other branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that obviously opens you up to more
molding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing every single branch,
even though that there's air exchange in
[SPEAKER_00]: these bags, there's still a chance to
bring it bold, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's another method and it's,
it's doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people like to introduce,
um, pollen via brushes, but brush,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got to remember pollen's
tiny when you're using these brushes,
[SPEAKER_00]: brushes, even if you don't see it,
some of these bristles will flick and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll flick the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if things aren't tied off everywhere,
like using those bags or other kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: bags, it's going to flick onto other
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is light stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a really, it's just like
anything, the more care you take,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more time you take, the more accurate
you can be when it comes to stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, as long as your mail is somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your mail is in the same room again,
or the same house, it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I mean, there's ways to do
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just, there's time,
patience, money, you know, they make
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen chambers of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have the money for a real
true isolation chamber, that'd be crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody who had those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so coming back to Boo's question on
like, which seems now to me, given what
[SPEAKER_02]: you said, like quite ambitious,
which is like, you dust different branches
[SPEAKER_02]: with different pollen, which you can do it
by imagine again, there's like a decent
[SPEAKER_02]: risk that your branches are cross,
cross pollinated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a good chance that there
will be some cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, yeah, pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing that, you're only
getting a small amount of seeds anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing branch, branch style
pollinations, and it's just for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely just for you or your friends
to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cross contamination thing probably
there isn't as important because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly just for people to get a look at
their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing, if you're, if you're like
selling branch made seeds, then you should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably start like having a serious talk
with yourself about like, is this really
[SPEAKER_00]: what I think it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do some you know, personal bias
confrontation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this really isolated as much as I think
it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And should I sell this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a decent representation of what I
want to sell?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is where your personal ethics
and morals come into play, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was there anything else you wanted to
say on the actual act of pollinating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we covered like, when to
pollinate, roughly how, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually it takes anywhere from three
days to a week to watch the pollen take,
[SPEAKER_00]: to watch, to know that the pollen has
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually the way we know that is that
the hair dies off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not just one or two,
it's several where you pollinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you know it's taking the pollens
viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually that three days to a week is
like breath holding time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst, especially if you're doing
reversals, you are like on pins and
[SPEAKER_00]: needles holding your breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time me and inspect us, yes,
I were like, it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like every time, you know,
oh my God, it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're both holding our breath
for each other's reversals because some
[SPEAKER_00]: people, this is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very expensive to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very expensive and very
demoralizing to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like to have something look
really good, born balls, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like do all that, get to the process and
just drop pollen and then it's not viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I guess it's quite a long
gamble, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you have to grow the plants and
like get the pollen, do all the stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our cases, it's not just one plant
that we're reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're reversing many to try to beat the
odds of, you know, sterile pollen or
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen or balls not forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that can happen too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's the same clone of the same
thing in the same tray, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: micro climate, you can have three not flip
or, you know, three totally flip,
[SPEAKER_00]: not drop pollen and seven totally flip and
drop pollen or vice any of those numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: could switch around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we're not even doing just
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing several, you know,
so it is a big undertaking and a big
[SPEAKER_00]: gamble for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to come back to reversal
specifically after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're happy, we can move on to,
you know, when will seeds be ready and how
[SPEAKER_02]: do you collect seeds and how do you store
seeds, you know, for long term viability?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for long time viability and storage of
seeds, there is a small process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as simple as make the seeds,
pluck them out and sell them right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe Matt, before you get into
that, like when, when do you even like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: When are seeds ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm like explaining this to someone
who has never harvested seeds before,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do they know when their seeds are
ready without chopping their whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and just hoping?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a few methods that I
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first you want to look at the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you can see in the tops where the
light hits the strongest, you can see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there is brown sticking out of the tops,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, if you're,
if you have some mature seeds at the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually if you're seeing brown seeds
poking out, that means that those seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top are fully mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where a lot of people make the
mistake of chopping their plant and just
[SPEAKER_00]: being done, letting it dry out and then
finding out that most of the seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: immature because the seeds at the top with
the most light tend to be the most mature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is go to the bottom of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about the armpits
because the armpits, I think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: called the primordial seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they're called that form in the
armpit area of the seeds or of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those almost always form real healthy,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are done fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, but the, the seeds in like a
bottom bud, getting the least amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that interest me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when those are done and if they're
done in multiple locations on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant, that's usually a good
predictor of the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, usually I'll do like four spots on
the bottom, four spots on the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: four spots on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if all of them are coming out nice and
mature, then that's when I start hardest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, if there's any immature in
there, I'll give it another week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it a whole nother week and just
come back to it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, that's usually the best
predictor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go down to those bottom nugs and check
those, check the maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm talking about maturity,
there's a few things also when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's the seed strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to put it in your fingers
and not crush it immediately with just a
[SPEAKER_00]: good amount of pressure right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good sign that there is,
is viability to the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could drop it on a hard surface and
you hear a sound like a ping, like a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific sound, that's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that there's weight and heft.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably an embryo in there that's
viable and the look of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the look is, is something that a lot
of people don't get like tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us use seed blowers now,
and that can blow that, that thin layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that tiger stripe layer is a thin layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be blown off just by using
these blowers and agitating the seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking them against each other in the
blowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best, the best predictor is usually
color, look, the tiger stripes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not all seeds have tiger stripes
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Southeast Asians are pure black,
a lot of Mexicans are pure black seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some are just hard gray,
you know, like a dark gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best predictor is the heft and the
touch for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and knowing that, you know,
the rest of the seeds are mature in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's important.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to ask, like in terms of,
you know, scanning the lower, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: lower branches and nodes, as well as the,
the higher ones closer to the light,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, I assume based on what you're
saying, that there's no risk of leaving
[SPEAKER_02]: them too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the ones that mature more
quickly, it's okay for them to be left.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as your humidity isn't too high,
because I have seen people leave seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants too long and have them
germinate inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks freaky as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like an alien plant, like with
the, you know, the tail sticking out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds as opposed to white hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks so freaky, but that's the only
time that there's ever really a big risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds store well in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things, the times we found,
like if we leave seeds inside bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they're like in a hot garage,
that's been, you know, 114 the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: summer, for whatever reason staying inside
that bud, it protects it better than
[SPEAKER_00]: almost anything else other than fridge or
freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to keep in mind too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great storage technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not really hurting your plant by
the seed staying in there longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get overly mature unless,
unless your humidity is way too high and
[SPEAKER_00]: you just need to check the humidity if
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, great, great points also on all
those different ways of checking for
[SPEAKER_02]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you did, you did just mention this,
but how about storage now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So storage after you harvest your seeds,
one of the things that we like to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: like at least in our group is to,
well, first you want to dry them out fully
[SPEAKER_00]: for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set them out in like a ramekin tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them dry out for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be totally dry,
no nothing on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll take those, I'll put them in
a freezer Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep specifying this because freezer are
stronger or thicker milling mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they call it for plastic,
thicker mills, the freezer bag by Ziploc
[SPEAKER_00]: or whoever, as long as it's a really thick
protective layer on the baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in another one just to ensure
that no moisture can get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I toss them in the fridge or
freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either one for me doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like fridge for, for the first run and
I'll throw them in the fridge for another
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that simulates the process of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when seeds are dropped from the plant
naturally and they kind of bury themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: underground, they stay cold for the whole
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets hot, then they germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want these things to germinate the
first second that they are warm and in
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by going, by pushing it through that
fridge process, it makes them germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast after, like even if it's a year
after two years after it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: that process is ready for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, for fun storage fails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any stories, anecdotes, witnessed anything
weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are very few breeders I know that
initially started out by buying seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: storing them in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us learned that the hard way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I went through a whole summer in
San Diego that was just the most brutal
[SPEAKER_00]: summer up to that point ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember moving there.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Bakersfield and thinking,
why did I move here for climate when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just as hot as Bakersfield and granted the
temperature wasn't the same, but because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was right on the beach downtown and all
that, like right at the Harbor downtown,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was insanely hot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hot that summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it cooked almost my whole collection
of seeds just because I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge to store them in straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fridge storage is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, some people prefer
freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer freezer for long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know I'm not going to be taking seeds
in and out, if it's something that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like I like to collect land races
from around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put those in a bag and I store those
in the freezer and I don't take them in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out to look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just in there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for a rainy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, 10, 20 years down the
line when I have a big climate outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I feel like they'll be able to be
grown best to express the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, if I'm taking
something in and out, fridge is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fridge is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like rapid, drastic temperature
fluctuations from, you know, below
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing to room temperature within an
hour, probably wouldn't be that good for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like doing a fridge for in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I'm taking stuff in and out
repeatedly, the fridge storage is just so
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find any room in your guy's
fridge for your collections, or if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: afford to run another fridge specifically
for some of the bigger collections,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be helping the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be helping yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched seeds lose viability in five
years without any kind of heat damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched them stay viable for 15 plus
years because of fridge, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and easy to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I again, I can't emphasize how many of
us have lost whole collections by not
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge storing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you did mention this, but I wanted to
draw a bit more attention to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have used the freezer, do you have
to pay attention to if you are taking them
[SPEAKER_02]: out to actually germinate that transition
in temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to move them from the freezer to
the fridge for a day, the fridge and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I know people that have
taken them out of the freezer to room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and pop them just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things where I just
like logically in my head, it makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to not push that fluctuation a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're trying to reduce as much risk
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce the risk and shock to the embryos
because they are small, little things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My little living things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in terms of the, so we started this
section, it was about regular seed making
[SPEAKER_02]: and we, I wanted to take us through a
fairly linear sequence of steps,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we did do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was thinking at this point,
we could kind of go parallel and talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about reversals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess here you've already talked
about, you know, when to pollinate,
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting seeds or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to go over that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, maybe here we're just talking
about, you know, applying the reversal
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals or spray, you know, how,
how, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you could talk about the different
approaches with different chemicals a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to go too deep, but yeah,
just so people have an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we start with someone who has your
reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mom decided to bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with reversals, like let's say someone
went to my site, purchased my spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he doesn't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I would say is pay attention
to what size you're buying because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: our medium and our large.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both come in the same size bottle,
16 ounces, but one, the medium is more
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute than the large essentially to save
water weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're only adding water to one to
ship it, you know, to add it to the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: within 64 more ounces or water or whatever
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the ratio of mixing
that to water is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the ratio wrong, you can cause
a reversal failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have the ratios correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large is one to 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium is one to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small is one to nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: One part of the solution, the stock
solution is what we sell to nine parts
[SPEAKER_00]: water or 18 parts water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get it, the idea is to,
you know, make your spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume people are going to put it in a
16 or 32 ounce bottle, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it up, shake it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My spray is a silver nitrate, sodium
thiosulfate base in a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to mix it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been thoroughly mixed,
but when you get it, it's sat for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: shake it up really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, on the instructions,
we used to say, you know, spray once a day
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure a reversal, because if you spray
daily, your plant will reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants like it more only once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants you only need to spray once
every two weeks and they'll reverse just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants need it once a day for three
and a half weeks specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it usually at three and a half weeks,
like on the money, you will see signs of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sex reversal, some kind of sexual,
like usually because what people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize when you're doing reversal,
you're not turning a female or you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: turning a female into a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making a female have male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing that, it's going to maintain
that female floral structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the male parts won't form and hang in
the armpits like they normally would on a
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's forming in a strong, tight bud
cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually with failures, what happens is
it clusters too tight and they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't like stretch out, get their
anthers out and open up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fully mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of that is from probably spraying
too much, as best we can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cases like those, you want to turn
it down to like one spring once a week or
[SPEAKER_00]: once every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, when you're doing
reversals by this point, you should know
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant irreversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should know it real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should expect the first reversal
to be a learning process, not a one and
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bang this out who's
successful because you have to learn the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and how it's going to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know any number of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I always recommend doing
like a tray of them because one is really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to learn from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you can learn from 12 of
the same clone and see how each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: clones of the same clone interact with the
spray from which angles and light sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a lot more data from that than you
would one plant that either reverses
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly or fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I often recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, like on a successful
reversal, the buds of male flowers will
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll open up and just like a male,
you'll be able to slap the side of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen will fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want in a successful
reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of times where it'll form in
that cluster and you see that they're open
[SPEAKER_00]: up and you know, you'll pick one of those
out of that tight little cluster and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll put it in your hand and you'll see
pollen, you know, it'll flatten out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you realize, oh God, I got to
grab tweezers and each one of these and
[SPEAKER_00]: drop it into the tray bin and no shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, I would say at least half of
the reverses go this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's a tedious process of taking
each of these petals or each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: floral structures over the trim bin or,
you know, you drop them all in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly agitate them and knock the pollen
out over the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of them are like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot are like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect to do one or the other,
a successful reversal where we're woohoo
[SPEAKER_00]: woohoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you just kind of cap it and
that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of time expect to be doing the
tweezer method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different degrees of success,
I guess we could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing's predictable no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, whether you're using a silver
nitrate sodium thiosulfate base,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're using a silver nitrate
cobalt green base, whether you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: just, what else is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver colloidal silver, whether you're
using that, it's all the same process on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same bud, trying to have the ethylene
blocking action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to achieve and
produce intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another basic question.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you even start applying the spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, that's a really good question,
because I think it's one of the most often
[SPEAKER_00]: asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen people like spray while the
plants and veg, thinking that might help.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea with spraying is you want to
first, in your brain, you need to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: clear division
[SPEAKER_00]: between the receivers and the donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super, super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your mind, that has to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're doing a reversal,
let's say you have 60 plants, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a 60 plant reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if some of those have to receive the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your mind, figure out what you want
to be the receivers and what you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And donors are being the plants that you
will spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we define it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to mentally separate the male
donors from the receivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to take the male donor,
or the plants that will be male,
[SPEAKER_00]: the donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to put them in a separate
lighting environment, maybe even a tent or
[SPEAKER_00]: another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to initiate flower,
whether that's putting it into 1212 for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, whether that's 1113, whether that's
1014, whatever flower is to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that first day that you initiate
flower to the plants you're spraying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to spray on that first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you'll start counting
three and a half weeks from to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: should expect to start seeing balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not always a guaranteed thing
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes plants will show in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll show in three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But almost always, by week three and a
half, they're showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how long they flower,
any of it, they'll always show some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of sexual reversal within three and a half
weeks using my spray specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you want to keep them in a
separate lighting environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start spraying source, and you
initiate flower on the day, and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying on the day you initiate flower
for those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually when you're doing reversals,
you want a anywhere from one week to two
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half to three week staggering period
of introducing females into the room with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes, depending on when that
pollen will drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say after you've been spraying it
for 21 days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is three weeks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start introducing some of the females
in right now to start catching the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at about week four or five,
if I'm using an Afghani type or a nine
[SPEAKER_00]: week flowering plant, at week four or
five, we want those to be catching the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen from this plant that is just about
to start kicking the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes about three, four,
or five weeks, depending on the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: for it to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just don't know exactly where it's
going to be, or when it's going to fire
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like to stagger some at a week,
some after two weeks, some after two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half weeks, just to mitigate the odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is an odds game when it comes
to reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like gambling, and it's beating off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost feels like every stage has a
different, I mean, it does every every
[SPEAKER_02]: stage has a different element of a gamble,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it used to kill me like for
years when me and Rasky and a few others
[SPEAKER_00]: with only Americans doing reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like the first thing they say
is, that's a shortcut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cheating, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a shortcut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, dude, you have no clue how
much of a shortcut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so much more labor intensive,
space intensive, like emotional than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would I would choose using a male
all day over reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had my druthers and the tools were
correct, like the plants were correct for
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want to achieve, I would prefer to
use a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over reversals, just because of how much
easier it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the emotions of loss and like
failures suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so many people quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the whole business over reversal
failures, because it's just devastating
[SPEAKER_00]: financially and emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's hard for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really reminds me, and this is kind of
a bizarre like aside, but I used to enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: watching these different shows online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either people who were metal detectorists
or like gold hunters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of see the kind of the
psychological game that they have to play
[SPEAKER_02]: with themselves, where they're like,
okay, we've invested all this money on
[SPEAKER_02]: this patch of ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got all this equipment here.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, please, I hope we find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it costs X amount of money to rent
this equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the time everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I broke down how like, yes,
I does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, that he still pays certain folks
when rooms don't reverse, like people are
[SPEAKER_00]: still having to be paid and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is a huge expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a massive expense each failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's okay when it's just me and a
piddling around in my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have like seven satellite
locations that people need to be paid at
[SPEAKER_00]: or what have you, because they live there
and it's their electricity and whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal works or not, they still have to
pay their electricity and for their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it becomes a serious business
choice, you know, because that can add up
[SPEAKER_00]: super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess those of you who are like not
not doing this commercially be thankful in
[SPEAKER_02]: that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, again, and it goes to what's
going on in the community that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing with their eyeballs on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is June 28, 2023 when we're recording
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the climate, you know, politically,
as far as cannabis goes, like the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: makers are dropping out real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are folding up shop and
going into some other skill that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: because weed ain't doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Candice isn't doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed making isn't bringing the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to start seeing a
lot less fence seed makers in America
[SPEAKER_00]: because of how much it costs to fail and
probably seen a lot more Spanish
[SPEAKER_00]: production of them seeds being sold by
American breeders pretending they're their
[SPEAKER_00]: own essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot take.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually there I don't know if we have
those questions in for this episode,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe for another episode there are
it's not like breeding politics is not
[SPEAKER_02]: something you guys have approached.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys obviously talked about breeding
politics a lot, but I think someone had a
[SPEAKER_02]: question that was like, and I don't think
we're going to answer it right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I was like, OK, so what's the
difference between like seed maker and a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, what are these breeders doing
who are like outsourcing and yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, yeah, that's a whole show in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've just covered reversals and I'm
wondering, is this a good time to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like gesture towards seed making with auto
flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I know that you mentioned to me
earlier before this started that like if
[SPEAKER_02]: we were going to talk breeding autos,
that's a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's very heavily selection
involved all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we were just focusing on the seed
making part, like this is just a one step
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the differences if you were
making seeds for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biggest thing to take into
consideration with auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are it's appealing
to people first that are new growers
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing, one variable they can take
out of the equation that like to people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have been growing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems silly to worry about the light
hours because that's done by a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but like that seriously,
that's a major consideration people take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another consideration people take with
auto flowers, I think, is that it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: sold to them, that it's going to be
flowering faster than other plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's equally as dank to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only trade off they think in their
mind is going to be the light hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When making seeds with auto flowers,
one thing you have to take into account,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't clone auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a keeper in seeds,
your best bet is to have already be making
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds with it at that point because you
can't clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like something you can easily
revege because once it's flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's flowering and that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a major downside to auto flowers
that you can't keep a clone and breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times people are just
flowering them out and making the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: the first gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to make seeds with auto
flowers without going into the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, and let's just say you want to
make seeds, make more seeds of auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, make sure you're crossing an auto
flower to an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not try to cross an auto flower line to
some photo period, which only auto growers
[SPEAKER_00]: call things photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you call things photo period,
you're calling yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, yeah, but you don't want to use
pollen from a regular male onto an auto
[SPEAKER_00]: female or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regular female being pollinated by an
auto male because what you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: is a pretty wild distribution of photo
period and auto flowering mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have a fully auto
flower line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to make more seeds of
an auto flower, cross an auto flower to an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower so you don't have to worry
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember like there's a term
that people use, which is semi auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like, have you heard that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some stuff like, let me think of
a good example, old Betsy maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it tends to heavily pre flower in
veg, meaning it's always kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's always at like week two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's always some kind of
stigma formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those semi autos you can make
seeds with in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have a male that, you know,
flowers in veg, because a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: will, if they're stuck in a little solo
cut, like once their roots hit the side,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will immediately start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have some of these,
you know, semi auto flowers in veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can technically make seeds with those
in veg under 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the damnedest things I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people like those because when you
put those semi autos into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're already like two weeks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets like a second stacking as it
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people like it for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of any other reason to use
those other than trying to create a new
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowering line through selective
breeding because it already has that early
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger trait, which kind of, you know,
there is debate on whether root ross is a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole nother part or section of cannabis
or whether it is like an Afghani that is
[SPEAKER_00]: just has this kind of mutant triggering
trait as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a trait that can be bred as
opposed to being a whole nother section or
[SPEAKER_00]: type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think I've seen the other way
I've seen semi autos being marketed as
[SPEAKER_02]: like fast flowering, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just sounds now like very
euphemistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if like they're referring to
dwarfs because there used to be a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: called auto flowering dwarfs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really see that term as much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a thing where like they would
supposedly they would be flowering from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to end of flower and 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what was promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people fell for that real fast
because from seed germination to flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 days is extremely fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it was more like 75 to 80,
which was still fast considering no veg
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I mean, is it so far that
you're going to take a dive in the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's worth that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually don't know shit about what is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gaining popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they they didn't have any
popularity in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time when I started fucking
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lately it seems like that there
is a group in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just like hardcore auto flowering
enthusiasts, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they need someone being enthused for
them, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was big in the European home grower
apartment market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it really booms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think for us, we've kind of
covered the like the more linear seed
[SPEAKER_02]: making set of questions, i.e.
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you make seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I mentioned earlier, there is a
whole section because people have all
[SPEAKER_02]: these different questions and ideas about
isolation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like whether you're isolating the
males, isolating the pollen, isolating the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinated branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it'd be interesting for us to
go through some of these questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you already gestured towards the
fact that you're pretty pessimistic,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, about isolating your males in
the same building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether that can work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK, let's just let's just get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dive in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dive in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK, of course, the general question,
and this one is raised by Dude-ness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ways to avoid pollen contamination in
small areas with turbulent airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But OK, don't answer that one,
because the more specific ones are like
[SPEAKER_02]: ones from booze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Setting up an isolated space for males or
donors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of did talk to this, speak to
this already, and I assume he means in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I assume so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, do you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to try to do it,
you know, what's the best you could do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best you could do would be to have
enough money to be able to buy the right
[SPEAKER_00]: filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set it up like a tissue culture lab for
each one of like a mini tissue culture set
[SPEAKER_00]: up for each one of your males and have all
the exhaust going way out of the house at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's it would be serious,
a serious undertaking to build that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool to see someone do it,
you know, for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would be a serious undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be done, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can have multiple, if you can have
multiple tissue culture labs and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: things being studied in different places
in a tissue culture lab, there's no reason
[SPEAKER_00]: that we couldn't pull it off of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but if you're if you're like at home,
you know, what are the what are the
[SPEAKER_02]: chances that you'll have access or none
zero?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like because you people argue with
me on this all day and I know it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some people think that HEPA
filters are just good enough, like tent
[SPEAKER_00]: next to tent next to tent with scrubbers
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my experience, like I've watched
that fail epically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pollen was in a central air
ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even like it was on the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it didn't matter when in the
tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're talking about even scrubbing
like both the intake and and exhaust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that still is like fallible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very fallible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because Boo's next question is like
even like an amplification of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is like, OK, multiple, multiple
males are donors, keeping them because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's even worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even that's compounding it even
further.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even saying like, OK,
now you might get pollination where you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's like you might get pollination
from God knows which donor or and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a who's your daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, like the one thing that I
tell people to look out for when assessing
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, how many males are they using
and how long did it take for them to amass
[SPEAKER_00]: these males and make these lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they've got like a list,
for example, seventy five males and it
[SPEAKER_00]: took them two years to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an issue, like unless you know that
they've got like this massive massive
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate production building somewhere
where this is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know they're making seeds in their
house and they've got seventy five
[SPEAKER_00]: different males in two years, you should
be very concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be very concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so if I were to like reframe this,
am I right in saying that?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you if you want to do any kind of like
seed making at all, you you should be
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared for like how do I phrase this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you should be prepared for
everything to get to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I tell people to like a lot
of my friends when they're just starting
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about making seeds, but they want
to still run since a production or I know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're selling flour or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell them there's going to be a
point of where you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make that distinction to be I'm either
going to only sell seeds or I'm only going
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell flour because at some point you're
going to have a whole sense of me a run
[SPEAKER_00]: get pollinated if you're playing with the
male in the same house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of got everybody I've told this to
that kind of ignored it comes back to me
[SPEAKER_00]: later and is like, yep, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I can't breed or I can't
grow since me and I had to switch to all
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a scary switch going from from maybe
something more something that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently more money making for someone
to support their life to jump to that to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to make this out of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, seeds are no guarantee
that they're going to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can not predict what the market's
going to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess if you in terms of like
different degrees of mitigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess like if you're if you're just
making seeds for yourself, maybe the main
[SPEAKER_02]: thing then is just at least just having
the one donor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you like, say you're just a home
grower and you're trying to make seeds for
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, just having one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least at least if there's
contamination, you know, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've a pretty good guess at where it's
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, like some people would
want to like break it down to,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, can I keep multiple males of one
strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll know what line it's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say you know, you pop a seed and
you're like, oh, my God, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce this, which male made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's where you're stuck
unless you just clone that one plant or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't keep clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're really screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take that into account as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, we had a last question on the
spy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's sort of covered because the
method seems irrelevant now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Scrustin was saying, you know,
doing the bag method for pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume he means either bagging the whole
plan or just bagging the branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always going to be the same kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, it's a matter of how
tedious, how good you are with like
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding pollen control, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can pull it off real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have done it for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some just really can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm one of the people who probably
would never even attempt it because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a clusterfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would trip or do something stupid,
knock a branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we kind of covered the other
forms of isolation in terms of like we
[SPEAKER_02]: talked earlier about isolating the
pollinated branches themselves and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to bag those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we don't have to go over those
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of it for this isolation and
contamination prevention section,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least in terms of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any other points you wanted to
make about isolation, contamination?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to drive home the point that a
lot of people have this idea in their head
[SPEAKER_00]: that you always need to have multiple
males from the same line to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And granted, I don't want to go too deep
into breeding theory on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have this idea that they need to
use multiple males to preserve diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is already a very diverse plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it with a line that's a
polyhybrid, it's going to be diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you use multiple males or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would always recommend going with one
male, trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't work out, if he doesn't make
what you like, select another male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no shortcut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luck comes into play a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luck can be a great helper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no quick way to rush through
this intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And intentionally make lines and learn if
you're rushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only thing I'd drive home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be tedious about pollen control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about pollen and how easy it
transports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'll make a lot of sense when
people hear the HEPA theory filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are a lot of people with
tents that make seeds that swear up and
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have seven reversals in their
house right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just kind of believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this will help some of those
people understand really what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there and how small pollen truly is.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a prompt, I was curious, what if you
had one pack of regular seeds and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: just like, I'm just going to let them rip?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is now we're kind of edging
towards more breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you think about open
pollination, obviously that implies there
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to be further stages that will
take advantage of that in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just said you recommend just using
one male.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about someone who's just like,
no, I just want to let the whole pack rip
[SPEAKER_02]: and let them do whatever they want?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the trade-offs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only time I would let all males in
a room is if it's a line that needs
[SPEAKER_00]: preserving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I have too few seeds to pop and I
want to look for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only time I'd recommend using a
bunch of males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we're doing that,
the intention isn't a, I'm going to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper and I want to know who made this
keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my only goal is seed making at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making more seeds to run through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, whether you use two
males or five, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to me, you're going to be doing this
for a potential to run through as many as
[SPEAKER_00]: you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, it's the numbers game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good points.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at this stage, I think we've more or
less covered the seed making side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless there's anything else you could
think of with regards to just seed making
[SPEAKER_02]: and not working generations or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at the top of my head, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here is where we have the
opportunity to maybe gesture towards a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the breeding strategy side of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions from Digger and Eli.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eli is actually someone who's in another
discord with me and Booze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've aggregated the questions together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the scenario is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're home growers and they can't keep
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the best way to capture slash
isolate slash lock down either outlying
[SPEAKER_02]: traits or an outlier plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as a whole, like man, not keeping
clones and trying to lock down traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be relying on pure luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So none of the you know, none of the
typical breeding strategies will help you
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of anything off the top of
my head and there may be something I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: forgetting, but like, you have to revisit
a male to use him if he passes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, granted, you can get it right the
first time, like I did with Bluebonnet.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second round, trying to get it
right a second time is very lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when with the second round,
I was super happy because it was so lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the second time it's like,
got to go back, do it again, do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always in the process of keeping
clones with that mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing selective breeding,
you really can't do selective breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: without keeping clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a key statement here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that was very clear to
me either, because like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's obviously this common conception
that like, OK, say I find one one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in this, you know, out of one or
two packs I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll just self it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to self it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you won't know you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Revege.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, OK, OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reveging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reveging is the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe let's reframe this question so
that I think it will be more constructive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's pretend that either you have reveged
or, while you may not have keepers per se,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can keep something for a couple of
runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, maybe you don't have like mothers that
you're keeping for years and years,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe you have enough space and time
that you can keep something for like a
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that makes the question
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I mean, if you can keep a
clone, then it's just down to selective
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and just breeding for whatever
traits you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like with the revege example,
you can get creative with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to be able to live with your
plants in 24 hours light during one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have multiple, at least two
spaces, one for flowering, one for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not keeping moms, I'm assuming
that you're probably not having a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: veg area by that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the point, like they only have
one place to flower and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we do assume that they have separate
spaces for the sake of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, it's just, yeah,
I mean, it's just a matter of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: popping what you like, keep a clone of the
one you like, you know, use a male,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the progeny, run the progeny,
if the progeny is good, you have your kept
[SPEAKER_00]: male, then you can drop him and go on to
the next, you know, the next filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, select for the same
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male on that, use him.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he works, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop him, you know, after the next run,
or go back, pop more of the F2,
[SPEAKER_00]: go through that, another male,
pollinate it, run the progeny,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it change anything, the fact that
like, again, unlike a commercial breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: on a larger scale, you know, you have
fewer plants to select from, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really change the overall strategy though,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you're still just working with the
best of what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the best of what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's two seeds, pop, two females,
or 300, it's always going to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it comes to the males,
they don't display traits like the female
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, it's not a visual trait that
we can tell that it's going to do what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want necessarily sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not a scent trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're using a male for high,
maybe this line that this male come from
[SPEAKER_00]: has an extremely rare high, and that's why
we're trying to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have a male from that line left,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always the same process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, I just want to make the,
our reframing of the question clear,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the original question was about
not being able to keep clones,
[SPEAKER_02]: which kind of does make this whole thing
basically impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to reframe it to be like,
well, you at least need to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: rerun something like a few times for this
to work out at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from revedge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aside from revedging.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be that, like the simple answer
would be revedging would be the key to the
[SPEAKER_00]: first question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe just spend a few moments
talking about revedging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is, is revedging fail-proof?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some plants don't revedge properly,
or do other plants revedge?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no issues with revedging,
but I've got a pretty good process down
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to make sure it has plenty of
root space, one, because if it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's all other kinds of hormones
firing off if it's, you know, root bound
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to deal with too many
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure it has plenty of root space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to revedge something,
I'm not worried about harvesting the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe, maybe I'll harvest a tiny
amount just to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've decided, oh shit,
this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to revedge this.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that, that's more likely the
scenario of a home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea behind revedging and why you
would leave most of the bud is because
[SPEAKER_00]: when I revedge and I leave the bud,
it leaves more sites for new growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: new vegetative growth to grow out of,
out of that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you harvest the bud, it has a lot
of less, there's a lot less places for new
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth to come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when people revedge,
they get greedy about their bud and they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to harvest their bud to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's only a little bit,
you know, like they really want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, again, you have to make a
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this thing such a good keeper that I'm
going to leave all this bud on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it rot and go to waste just to get
more vegetative material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it, eh, I'd rather smoke the bud and
not worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, it's like a numbers game once
again, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The more bud sites you can afford to
leave, the higher the chances that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a successful revedge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is, and this is the
most important, 24 hours of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes about two months for a
successful revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm expected to take about two months to
where you're seeing some kind of good
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth coming off that you can
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes longer, sometimes three,
but it's a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of electricity in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, but if you aren't keeping
clones and you can't have a separate veg
[SPEAKER_00]: and flower space, then revedging is your
best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to work through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the 24 hour lightening almost
always ensures it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of root space, 24 hours light and
plenty of, uh, bud sites, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or bud left on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't, don't strip it bare and it'll
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how long does it take generally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a bit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, two, two to three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long process, but granted there's
been so many times where it saved my ass
[SPEAKER_00]: so many times, like where I'll take a
clones of something, be flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's last few clones died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I got is this last plant that's in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great case for revedging too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, like I'm a big
proponent of it because it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that most people don't talk
about with revedging is that it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sets the plant back to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like plants are like some plants that are
more like slow, not as vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tired from whatever disease you
give it a good revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant will be back to vigorous
and spry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it does reinvigorate the plant
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a, an experiential take,
not a scientific take, but it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed enough to where it's like,
okay, that's something that happens and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've even, we've even gone as far as
making seeds and then revedging that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, see how the seeds form during a
revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is always interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember from forum, you know,
from my earlier days on the forums,
[SPEAKER_02]: like monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're using the revedge to like,
uh, create much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of goofy to do it, but yeah,
that's a, that is a technique for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, revedge seeds, revedge
seeds usually come out more hardy with
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does hold pretty true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a, this has been a funny
little side path to come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think that's actually quite
fascinating.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, returning to this like original
scenario of like, uh, I'm a home grower
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've got a keeper that I want to like
try to lock in, in a seed line basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is now more just a general breeding
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wondered if you wanted to cover that,
that old territory again of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in terms of locking in expressions and
traits, um, the differences between like
[SPEAKER_02]: back, cross, reversal, uh, forward
breeding, out cross, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, is it worth just broad stroking
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was something that you guys have
covered a lot, but yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I'm trying to think of a best way
to talk about this without having to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the detail of the different
generations and essentially just be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if someone wants to, if someone has a
clone that they like, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to reproduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quickest way to reproduce that clone
or to get a, uh, a version of that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: in seed, the closest version to that,
because there's no way to make a mirror
[SPEAKER_00]: image of it and seed fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what S1s are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what Fenn seeds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not clone versions of themselves
in seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other day I got a question
from a reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to rephrase this a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question from a reader and they
were asking or seed maker that was asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, if I make these fence seeds,
are they going to be clones of themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is this going to be, can I tell the
customers if you want to see a clone of
[SPEAKER_00]: this in seed by these fence seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to explain, no, that's not how
this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of people do have that
expectation that a S1 or self line,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, meaning a plant pollinating itself and
making seeds of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not any outside genetics coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that plants own genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is not going to be a clonal
representation of that plant to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to pop, you know,
10 of those seeds and they're not all
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pop and look just like that
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not how selfing works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of people have that
impression that that's where they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to find the exact clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to be just like the
clone mother and even some seed makers
[SPEAKER_00]: have this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's not really how it works,
but if I were going to give someone advice
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had a clone, they didn't know
much about breeding, but they had a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: and they wanted to make a seed line that
was most representative of that clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to trap it in seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say go the self to route as
opposed to choosing a male from a
[SPEAKER_00]: different line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it's a fam line that they're
running, you know, instead of choosing a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seed or a male from a different
line, bringing in outside genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it and having regular seeds,
I would reverse it using a reversal spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing so, you're not bringing in
outside genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything you're going to see are what
comprises, let's say if you're reversing
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum, it's going to be everything
that comprises the genetics of bubblegum
[SPEAKER_00]: inside that self line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it might be all really close
surrounding that bubblegum expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it might just be a bunch of
earthy and bubblegum was the weird
[SPEAKER_00]: outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say outlier means, you know,
uh, it's only one in a thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see this, this pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the earthy sweet expressions are
one, you know, one in 10 or one in two,
[SPEAKER_00]: like every two seeds, you're going to see
that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in one in a thousand, you might see
this pink bubblegum expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what an outlier is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and are there, if the odds are that
steep, what, what can you, what else can
[SPEAKER_02]: you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if the odds are steep like that,
the odds are steep like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best method is to use, uh,
selfing because you speed through the
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation process much faster
because you're not bringing in outside
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not working with new stuff that
you're bringing in and trying to select
[SPEAKER_00]: away from whatever plant that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all working towards that single trait
and what you'd want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd self it, you'd pop as many seeds
from that selfing as you can until you
[SPEAKER_00]: found the one that is exactly like you
like in that generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take that selection, you self that
one, and then you do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each new generation, you're going to
be getting much closer and closer and
[SPEAKER_00]: closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing good selections to that
original clone in those seed, each,
[SPEAKER_00]: each round is going to be really tight and
get tighter and tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the S four, you should be seeing
like extreme, extreme uniformity for that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific trait you're reading for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that the plant's going to
look like a clone of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding for the pink bubblegum
trait, all of them should have the pink
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum trait by about S four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what are the trade-offs here taking
this part down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there are multiple self generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the major trade-off is going to be
inbreeding, um, mutations, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're, because you're selfing,
you're going to see all those,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, those wild expressions come out to the
forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those, those recessive genetics,
as we refer to them, those one in a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands are going to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that is also going to be
mutations and inbred traits that we may
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more inbred it gets each,
each, uh, self generation might come with
[SPEAKER_00]: more trash involved, um, along with what
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we say, uh, low flow or high ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that makes sense as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Ken, what about, um, for using forward
breeding to try to do something similar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, what are the differences here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, does it take a lot more time to
achieve similar results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, forward breeding, let's just
assume we have a regular seed line of a
[SPEAKER_00]: single line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for just, for example, my blueberry,
uh, in cross, which is like an inbred
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have males and females of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be easy to do like a,
a worked line of regular, just doing F1,
[SPEAKER_00]: F2, F3, F4, because it's a very uniform
line as is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's say we have, um, for example,
animal cookies crossed to animal mints pie
[SPEAKER_00]: or something, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like something that has like six strains
on one side and six strains on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not related.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a hell of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of time crossing those running through all
the potential expressions from this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 12 way poly hybrid, trying to pick
what you like, going down the next route,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take so many generations just to
try to make anything uniform because of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the traits that both sides bring,
which is why I would highly recommend in
[SPEAKER_00]: that case, using selfie when it's a poly
hybrid clone that you found that you like
[SPEAKER_00]: the quickest way to quickest route is
through selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a regular seed line of
something that's been worked, filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generations, that's the normal reading
method is, is just F1, F2, male,
[SPEAKER_00]: female, male, female, male, female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the only time we really use back
crossing, which is to say like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I have a blueberry bubble gum on one
side and a blueberry on another side,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it would ideally, ideally be 66%
blueberry, 33% bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In genetics, that doesn't mean that the
expressions are going to come out the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but genetically 66% and 33%, um,
uh, bubble gum, 66% blueberry by crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's already blueberry and
bubble gum with another blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's considered a back cross because
you're crossing blueberry back onto
[SPEAKER_00]: something that already had blueberry in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the best, the best times to use that
most people like, you'll see people
[SPEAKER_00]: selling BX4, BX5, BX6.
[SPEAKER_00]: With BXs, the best thing that we found
that it's used for is locking down a
[SPEAKER_00]: single trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say in this blueberry bubble gum,
I want to find a super blueberry type
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in this blueberry bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by crossing the blueberry again,
lock in that blueberry trait, because
[SPEAKER_00]: this, let's assume this, this blue bit,
this male is true breeding for blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've locked it in, in this hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most of the time it's going to be
true breeding for this blueberry scented
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only need to BX1 one time to make that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using good selection,
there's no need to take it to a BX2.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that point, you should either work at
filial generations forward or
[SPEAKER_00]: self-generations forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to keep working backwards
using back crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's not how you lock in multiple
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lock in multiple traits going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now, this is more, you know,
advanced breeding theory, but the idea is
[SPEAKER_00]: lock multiple traits going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock a single trait going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can lock in a single trait going
backwards, then lock in multiple traits
[SPEAKER_00]: going forwards.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going forwards includes selfing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that's an excellent summary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I don't think that, um,
I've heard this account as like
[SPEAKER_02]: succinctly, um, as you've presented it
here in like previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad that you, you covered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an amazing paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, written by Chimera and he's,
he's like, I've talked to him about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, I probably wrote that when I was
drunk or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the myth of cubing or like the
myth of cubing and back crossing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the smartest papers I've
ever read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually wrote a, an addendum to it
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember where it's at,
but try to Google the myth of cubing and
[SPEAKER_00]: back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can remember, I'll put it in the
description too, but it's a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great paper talking about the
scientific, uh, like what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically for back crossing in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're kind of wrapping up,
but I think we did get a related question
[SPEAKER_02]: to this on like, you know, resources and
reading, uh, Trevor Leahy from breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: syndicate asked, you know, are the grow
Bibles that people have mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: countless times, like marijuana botany or
marijuana growers guide, uh, how reliable
[SPEAKER_02]: and how accurate are they still?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what would you look to gain from
reading those in 2023?
[SPEAKER_00]: So marijuana botany is not a grow book by
any stretch of the imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a breeding theory book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't recommend that for someone
to learn growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're going to learn breeding
and cannabis to this day, it's still the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, Robert Mark has come out with a
new book called, uh, marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethno botany and evolution written with
Mark Merlin, which is now the standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a heavy collegiate textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not meant for someone trying to just
learn cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not a good introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So marijuana, is it more theoretical list
practical?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it's more, it's just thicker
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really understand breeding
concepts and breeding terms to jump into
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mark Merlin book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more, it's, it's already taken for
granted that you have some of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to put it, like if you've
been through some science in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a junior college, that book might be more
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana, ethno botany and evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're comfortable reading college
textbooks, that's how it's written.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a college textbook that books for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana botany is more for someone who
doesn't read college textbooks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but wants to understand breeding theory
and its basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, like the Jorge Cervantes grow book
and, you know, the Mel Frank one,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people started out on that and it
did a lot of people, a lot of good.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, growing has come so far,
so far, even in the past 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, how people have been able to,
um, get cannabis to perform and express is
[SPEAKER_00]: leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if you look at the old Sensi
catalogs for seeds, you see stuff being
[SPEAKER_00]: stuffed with nitrogen to the gills,
just Buffy, no resin, nothing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand how to grow plants a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think maybe those old books,
while they are great to have in your
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket for understanding some of cannabis
and knowing like the pest stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what to look for, for like
deficiencies and how the leaves look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those are great, but as far as
learning how to feed, there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: more advanced courses now from different
universities on the best way to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it likes organic feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the revs, um, uh,
uh, tree living organics book for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that want to get into TLO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I mean, like there's online
courses from, from universities on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: that are so much more advanced on soil
science and soil biology that could
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like advanced people's growing
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was probably where I would
recommend starting as opposed to those
[SPEAKER_00]: books, but those books are great
foundation, but for modern technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the colleges and universities are
just doing the most groundbreaking stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil science and soil biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we are in this final section of,
um, essentially community questions that
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't necessarily fit into any of our
previous sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one thing I want to signpost
is that some of these are more on the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding side and, and like Matt,
Matt presented a couple of really rich,
[SPEAKER_02]: dense nuggets for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this episode was mostly about seed
making.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we also want to keep open the
possibility of having a dedicated episode
[SPEAKER_02]: on breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, where we maybe talk more about like
each generation and all that, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's important to go back over and redo
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could definitely do that,
but for in, in the interest of like just
[SPEAKER_02]: answering a few more of these questions to
wrap up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of these are pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Loiger from the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: What traits do you lose when selecting
from small plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, you can't select for outdoor
plant structure, large plant structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're growing in one gallon parts,
but you know, are there any other traits
[SPEAKER_02]: that get lost if you are search hunting
through smaller plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hunting through smaller plants,
um, some pest resistance maybe might get
[SPEAKER_00]: lost in the smaller plants or,
or, I mean, they may even get attacked
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, obviously structure yield
comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, seeing how far you can imagine not all
plants, sorry to interrupt, but I guess in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of yield, it would be that like,
even though your plant yields X amount in
[SPEAKER_02]: a one gallon pot, it doesn't necessarily
scale in a linear fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go up pot size, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I mean, there are certain things
that I think you can learn about your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant better from smaller pot sizes versus
just blowing it out and having the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding plant, um, you can, which is
terpenes expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a finer expression of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I believe in like a two or three
gallon pot, you can see like, so it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: being pushed too hard in any one
direction, but it's enough, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: root space for it to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, you're, you're obviously
going to lose out on structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're going indoor versus
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just way too different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I'm not a proficient outdoor
grower at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an indoor grower and exclusively
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my outdoor runs have been minimal and
not even that great, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did want to kind of, um,
draw attention to the, one of those points
[SPEAKER_02]: you made, which is that, um, on terpenes
and maybe like, uh, cannabinoid balance,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, chemical compound balance in general
does change with scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know y'all have like mentioned that,
what is it like the blue dream at
[SPEAKER_02]: different, different scales, performing
very differently for example, UK cheese,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can get a thousand
expressions from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I've told stories about how
I've thrown away the same clone several
[SPEAKER_00]: different times that smelled different
because I thought it was a fake cut
[SPEAKER_00]: because it didn't smell like my,
my first smoking of cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on, when I grew it a
certain way is like, Oh, this is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: berry plant, but now it smells like cheese
with the hell, you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the most important things
I've ever learned in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, was the plasticity of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how truly different it is and how hard
it is to identify clones and different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in flower, uh, through pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My earlier point that like, of course,
you know, we want to try to seek out as
[SPEAKER_02]: many clues as possible, um, in advance of,
uh, flowering something out or breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, we, we looking, there's this
tendency to look for, um, science,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that leads onto the next question from
Morris.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, do you think that there are traits
that tend to be overlooked in selections?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we know that the most common ones
are going to be like, um, structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor, smell, poetry, um, urgency,
um, mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those are obviously really
common ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there ones you think are overlooked
that maybe a bit more minor, but also
[SPEAKER_02]: quite important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi is the most important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the most important to
everyone, but in the, during the Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: era, I really feel like that's been the
most ignored because you can't visually
[SPEAKER_00]: see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't pick it fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you can't tell which plant
has the best high really fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like wallets and flower,
how are you going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's definitely one of the main ones
because it's just not something our senses
[SPEAKER_00]: really pick up until we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes time, um, to, to properly
like test and smoke a whole crop of like
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 selections takes even more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and how much time you want to devote
to that and how much space you put in
[SPEAKER_00]: between each sampling of each high and
what you're doing, the mindset and set
[SPEAKER_00]: like all come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, I don't know,
kind of rambling, but no, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, this is a difficult
question because like, um, I know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, I think not so as mentioned
this, like an interesting one that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know many people think about is that there
may be a sweet spot for say flower
[SPEAKER_02]: density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, where it's like, oh, actually,
if it's too dense, it doesn't smoke well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's too loose, then it's too loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be there's something in there,
but I think generally the main things that
[SPEAKER_02]: people select for it's pretty well
covered.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, there's also, there's also
selecting against and people have selected
[SPEAKER_00]: against an intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's also detrimental
to cannabis because there are things
[SPEAKER_00]: called linked traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the times those linked traits
might be linked to that intersex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those may be traits like,
you know, heavy volatile sulfur compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that smell skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may have lost a lot of that because
people selected against an intersex trait
[SPEAKER_00]: that's linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's one theory, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there are, there are many traits
that we select against that maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we are considering it, but we're
selecting against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be hurting the overall gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that just blows open the degree of
complexity here where, yeah, you may be,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, implicitly in selecting for
something you may, sorry, in selecting for
[SPEAKER_02]: something, you may be implicitly say
selecting against something else that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't even know about.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the progeny has to be run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so important to run the
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you just never truly know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with the, for example, with the blue
bonnet male, the first, the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used to select him was because what
was his purple stock stripes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like the overall look,
because I've, I remember DJ's blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: mother clone that has somewhat of a
blueberry smell and some of the other blue
[SPEAKER_00]: selections that I've made over the years
that are kind of blueberry muffin all had
[SPEAKER_00]: this look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular one had his,
his leaf sticking 90 degrees from top to
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, all the leaves are sticking
straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, okay, that's, that's like
him raising his hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as good as any thing using the,
you know, what little education I have
[SPEAKER_00]: with blueberry, those specific traits that
identified visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that I was like, okay,
well, this is as good as any to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I, when I, when I was dusting
the room, when I was smacking the mail,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I had on this big face mask
with the canisters on it and usually you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't smell much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sent through that thing, but I was
smelling nothing but berry coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: when he was walking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point I knew that he at least
has oils that, that have a berry smell to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a plus, but even with all that,
I had no clue if he was really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass that blueberry trait until I ran the
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no way to know because in
using that purple stripe stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even though he smells blueberry
combining it with whatever potential
[SPEAKER_00]: females I have that trait on that plant
locks out that very trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll never see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's all kinds of things to take
into account when it comes to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the upshot from, from that is
we're not trying to say that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't use, try to use early earlier
indicators to help you narrow your search,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just you have to know that there's no
silver bullet and there's no replacement
[SPEAKER_02]: for actually running something out or it's
progeny out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no shortcuts, no silver bullet,
no shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no shortcuts better than
knowing the line and running the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing what you're working with is super
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you haven't bred with it,
let's say you've run, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 clones from that same line for a year,
you'll know more about that line and its
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and its different expressions just
from running those 10 different plants
[SPEAKER_00]: from that line over a year than you've
realized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go on to do this, the breeding
work, with it, you'll be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, I know that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that, you know, clone number three
and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that comes into play and helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't really realize it until
after they're doing the progeny selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you start realizing all
that time you spent learning those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: really, like how important it is when
selecting traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a final question also from
Loiger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any differences between breeding
short and long flowering strengths?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another multi-tiered complex thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it can go from like, you know,
to where Neville was saying, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't use haze males, only use haze
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the haze males breed like trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know that like people have these theories
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, when it gets to basics,
the main difference is going to be flower
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you pollinate, when you
pollinate, how long the seeds take to
[SPEAKER_00]: mature and how long, you know,
the, the, the male flowers versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: female flowers, and when they're going to
go off, that's the main considerations
[SPEAKER_00]: when taking into account seed making
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I think that's,
that's us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We covered the sequence, you know,
the specific techniques and steps of
[SPEAKER_02]: making seeds for regulars, reversals,
autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We covered some of the, questions around
isolation, contamination, prevention
[SPEAKER_02]: overall, pretty, you know, pretty
pessimistic risk averse response,
[SPEAKER_02]: which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my responses are going to be like
risk averse and with sterility and like
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness in mind when it comes to
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally at the end, we got to gesture
towards some actual breeding strategy and
[SPEAKER_02]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sorry, strategy and theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and maybe we will do another episode
that's dedicated to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think, um, yeah, I think that's
a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I'm happy with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, uh, finish up, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything you want to plug
specifically or say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, I'm good.
Nah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just happy to be invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, go check out our Patreon
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we all hang out and shoot the
shit like throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're pretty interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a, it's an interactive
discourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one of the dead ones where like people
join and be like, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we're really, really active there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our new drop with breeder
syndicate.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, his headband stuff cross a little
F1 DERB action there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the punchy crosses drops and all
that's on riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we have my bonded stuff and we
have the reversal spray, which we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about some time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, today, hopefully that helps some of
you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, please like share and
subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how important that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like, um, with YouTube's algorithm,
they're putting us in like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mature categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really get recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a grassroots effort to get people
to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know your friend will dig it,
um, please share and like it if you like
[SPEAKER_00]: it or don't hit dislike if you don't and
comment and tell me why I suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also trying to get 10,000
subscribers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so does not come out of a cage until
we get 10,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, anyway, thank you, thousand for,
for helping me, um, outline this and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a real linear fashion going for
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, that's super helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help people listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you brother.
