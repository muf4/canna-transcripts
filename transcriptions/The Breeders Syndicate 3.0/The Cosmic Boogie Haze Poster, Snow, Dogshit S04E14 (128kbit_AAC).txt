[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who live here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dogs, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could talk about haze, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me flip this around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not going to be my face,
it's going to be the haze poster,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll try to get it so it's nice and
bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: And illuminated and clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see if that works.
Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to aim this little light thing down
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we start.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original haze poster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is my pride and joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm willing it to Not-So.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the – also referred to as the
Cosmic Boogie poster from 1976.
[SPEAKER_02]: RL and C or K, supposedly, and the Haze
Brothers are all – revolve around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk about some haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: where do you want to start with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with – what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze C?
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze A?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to start with haze males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to start with the original
breeding of haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably the most realistic starting
point is the mid-'80s, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably – so there's all this
stuff about haze, and obviously haze
[SPEAKER_03]: existed in California in the 70s,
possibly late 60s, and there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of excellent sourcing on that aspect of
haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few people that know a bit,
and they don't really agree necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of what happened is it seems like
it was a – if you believe Sam Skunkman,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a Colombian by Colombian cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like because people didn't
understand breeding very well back then,
[SPEAKER_03]: the first initial crosses and hybrids they
made over the years were the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at his poster right there,
you could see silver haze on one side.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could see magenta gold on another.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could see different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all named phenos that would pop
up out of their seed line, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you think back to the early 70s,
people's idea of breeding was pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: rudimentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, people went through some
processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: People didn't really know what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of like a mystery exactly
who the what, the why, and where in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the story picks up when Sam
Skunkman got himself into some trouble in
[SPEAKER_03]: America a couple of times, and it appears
that he took a bunch of seeds of skunk and
[SPEAKER_03]: haze, and then he gathered up a bunch of
other breeders' work, like Mel Frank and
[SPEAKER_03]: some other people's stuff, and he went to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he went to Amsterdam,
he ended up hooking up with a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where the story diverges.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you believe Neville's side of the
story, Neville bought a bunch of very old
[SPEAKER_03]: seed from Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was dated from the late 60s to the
early 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he barely got any of them to pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you believe Sam's side of the story,
he sold Neville the exact same seed that
[SPEAKER_03]: he sold everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was reproductions that he made in
Amsterdam after he landed there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he claims that Neville never got
anything special.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Neville story has never really
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sam story has certainly changed from
the various forums, like Overgrow and
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis World, to... What's the one that
came after that?
[SPEAKER_02]: After what?
[SPEAKER_03]: After Cannabis World and Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The various forums, Sam is on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think his story has stayed
consistent over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's claimed to have given Neville only
clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's claimed to have given him old seed,
new seed, this, that, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But regardless of all that, Neville claims
he tried to sprout a bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so after... After Neville tried to pop
a bunch of them, and almost none of them
[SPEAKER_03]: came up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got a girl that he thought was a
piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he grew it, and he didn't realize it
was any good until after he'd already
[SPEAKER_03]: killed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he ended up with two boys,
which everybody knows as A and C.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where the story gets famous,
because the vast majority of what people
[SPEAKER_03]: know as Hayes, and the whole Hayes story,
comes from those two dads, for lack of a
[SPEAKER_03]: better term, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything that Neville commercially
sold NL5 Hayes, Silver Hayes, all that
[SPEAKER_03]: type of stuff, that was all Hayes C,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had Hayes A.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made a ton of crosses in 88 and 89 with
Hayes A.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one of his workers didn't keep a
dad and bloomed everything on his last
[SPEAKER_03]: main seed run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he had a bunch of seed,
and he had a bunch of hybrids,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he never sold commercial stock of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Sam sold a bunch of his Hayes seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to be able to buy from the Flying
Dutchman, and I believe he used to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy it from Positronix, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to be able to buy Sam's open
pollination Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The different thing is that nobody seems
to have ever found jack shit out of Sam's
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the stuff that he gave Neville,
that seems to be where all the quality
[SPEAKER_03]: came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you're talking about two
dudes who don't get along, don't see eye
[SPEAKER_03]: to eye, didn't like each other,
and they both had very different versions
[SPEAKER_03]: of what happened in the mid-80s,
in a don't feel that they had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it becomes sort of a mission of like,
who do you choose to believe, and what
[SPEAKER_03]: part of their story do you choose to
believe?
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's undoubtable is that all the
shit that people know about the PIF,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Church, the Cuban Black Hayes,
the A5, the C5, Super Silver Hayes,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mango, all those different, the SOMA work,
all that different stuff, it all came from
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids that Neville made, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's undisputable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all came from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of things in cannabis,
people involved aren't the most honest
[SPEAKER_03]: folk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no matter what era you're in,
we seem to attract some shady hustling and
[SPEAKER_03]: some lying and some fibbing and some like
polishing of your story and all that other
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it, I don't know, you know,
we, you know, King cultivars, I tend to
[SPEAKER_03]: believe Neville's story, mostly because
all this fire came out of Neville's lines
[SPEAKER_03]: and not very much fire came out of Sam's
that you can really ascertain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Northern Lights Five Hayes
probably has more elite cuts named after
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That still exists that are 25 to 30 years
old than any other line that's ever been
[SPEAKER_03]: made by anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fucking goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're both on the Atlantic,
you know, on the USA side and on the
[SPEAKER_03]: European side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like from 88 to 95 people found
white hot fire in that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the most successful cannabis
hybrid of all time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whether he got lucky,
whether he, you know, I mean all that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can, you know, but that F1 was,
you know, it's got rare power and people
[SPEAKER_03]: to this day, honestly, the reason why on
the West Coast people don't like Hayes is
[SPEAKER_03]: because the Hayes they know is Jack or
Super Silver Hayes or some of the poly
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the best F1s have been hoarded
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were hoarded in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: In America, the Cubans and the Dominicans
hoarded the shit out of their cuts and
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't allow it to get spread out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's kind of amazing actually for
as long as it's been out, most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: other elites have leaked and snuck out and
a lot of people have gotten a hold of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really haven't been able to about
the other stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you really think about it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the A5 and the C5 are in America
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things were found in 88 and 89.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think they came to America
until a couple of years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they were literally on lockdown
for something like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could go to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to, you know, I used to be able to
smoke them when I went to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a staple in Amsterdam coffee
shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a staple of cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, the thing is, is to be perfectly
honest, most of the people that think they
[SPEAKER_03]: know Hays don't because they never got to
smoke the real deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just really the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does Mr. Nice fit into the Hays story?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a little bit longer convo,
but the basic story is, man, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: a long story.
[SPEAKER_03]: The super short version is that Neville
got busted during Operation Green Merchant
[SPEAKER_03]: and ended up in fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ben and Alan drunkers had money and
were willing to buy them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they weren't willing to buy them out
unless he gave them unless he sold them
[SPEAKER_03]: his fucking company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to get his freedom and to get
out of the situation he's in, he had to
[SPEAKER_03]: sell Seed Bank to Sensei Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he ended up being Sensei Seeds main
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of that ended up being that Sensei
ended up owning most of his genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They trademarked a bunch of his famous
names like Super Skunk and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after four or five years, he wasn't
really getting along with Ben and Alan
[SPEAKER_03]: drunkers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he left Sensei Seeds and him and
Shanti started working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they bred together for a few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that combination breeding led to the
Super Silver Hays, the Mango Hays,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Neville's Hays.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't allow Arjun to get any of the
seed, any of the cuttings, moms,
[SPEAKER_03]: dads, or even grow any of the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: They provided his coffee shops with the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they worked at Greenhouse,
Shanti and Neville never allowed Arjun to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a hold of any of the cuts or any of
the moms or dads.
[SPEAKER_03]: They provided him with the seeds for sale
at Greenhouse and they provided him with
[SPEAKER_03]: the flower to sell at Greenhouse,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does everybody get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully everybody got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happened is they, after Neville
left Sensei, him and Shanti worked
[SPEAKER_03]: together on the Super Silver Hays,
the Mango Hays, and the Neville's Hays
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: They each had a part of Greenhouse Seeds
and they kept Arjun out of the loop by not
[SPEAKER_03]: giving him any cuts or any flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just basically gave him flower to
sell in the coffee shop and then they
[SPEAKER_03]: provided the seeds and the packaging to
sell to the seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually they didn't like the
deal with Arjun and so Shanti left and
[SPEAKER_03]: took the cuts and went to Switzerland and
started Mr. Nice Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how Mr. Nice Seeds, and then
Matt can confirm this, but Neville sold
[SPEAKER_03]: his seed bank era, 80s era seed collection
to Shanti for about $1,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: A chunk of money when Neville was broke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Shanti has, or had at some point,
a bunch of Neville's breeding work as well
[SPEAKER_03]: as a bunch of Neville's old seed,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of how, there's a lot of
people that believe in Shanti.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of people that think he's
full of shit, which is pretty common for
[SPEAKER_03]: the weed industry, but he legitimately
worked with Neville and he legitimately
[SPEAKER_03]: had access to Neville's cuts, Neville's
breeding parents, and a bunch of old 80s
[SPEAKER_03]: seed for Neville, for lack of a better way
to put it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he's probably the main source
for a lot of Neville stuff today that's
[SPEAKER_02]: more reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most reliable sources for
Neville's work today, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, so I mean, despite his,
you know, like, but the thing is,
[SPEAKER_03]: about Shanti is that there's not really a
way to cross reference whether he has it
[SPEAKER_03]: or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take his word for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're not in his mom room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not in his dad room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume he's lost some things,
but what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd never tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and on top of that, he might not
be lying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he might have, it's,
it's, we don't have any evidence one way
[SPEAKER_03]: or the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times what happens with this shit
is, you know, people end up believing the
[SPEAKER_03]: grower they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that really is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And disbelieving the grower they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope people can hear me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing any more comments scrolling
at the bottom of the page anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing I see is all heart,
no hype, go outside, foo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm still seeing stuff here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can everybody else hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can they hear me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they responding that they can actually
hear?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, that's kind of the,
that's the, that's the long short version
[SPEAKER_03]: of Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he has legitimate, he has more
provenance in access to nevel stuff than
[SPEAKER_03]: almost anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he may still have Afghan tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might be, you know, it's, it's been,
you know, when Matt was plugging the,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the discord server and all that,
um, we have endless debates on what's
[SPEAKER_03]: still alive and what's dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, um, it's, uh, hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about, um, PIF?
[SPEAKER_03]: PIF?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's probably one of the most
questions I get asked the most on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it seems like, so, you know,
the, it's kind of shrouded in a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of mystery, but what it seems like is that
there was a guy that bought, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a guy that bought seed from
Nevel in 1988, NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was, uh, grateful.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on Grateful Dead tour and he found
this, this phenol that he gave to the
[SPEAKER_03]: student Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the, uh, the original guy overdosed in
1990, sadly, apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, the PIF was born for
lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's gotten a bunch of names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people think it smells like
frankincense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the church thing came out and
it sort of got, it's, it's sort of got
[SPEAKER_03]: hype in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and as a result of that, because there
was a bunch of money in it, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of other people bought the exact
same seed line to Nevel and L5 Hayes and
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to find their own PIF, their own
church, their own Heights Hayes,
[SPEAKER_03]: their own block work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so that's where seemingly most of
the phenols come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost all the good phenols of NL five
Hayes come from 88 to 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's, that seems like it's Nevel is
confirmed that sometime in 94 and 95,
[SPEAKER_03]: the NL five mother died at Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so after that, the cross was never
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are asking also about Cuban black
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you want to go over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuban black Hayes is, um, it's most likely
just another, it's just another phenol of
[SPEAKER_03]: NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if people, if people want to go over
it, things that are likely NL five Hayes
[SPEAKER_03]: are PIF, Heights Hayes, Cuban black Hayes,
the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, all those things are NL
five.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL five Hayes is in, uh, in Europe,
a five C five, there's multiple copies of
[SPEAKER_03]: each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, C five meet, you know, it's,
that's Nevel's notation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It meant that it was Hayes C crossed to NL
five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a five means it was the a dad crossed
a NL five, a NL five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so there's a bunch of F one hybrids
that are famous that float around Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them have crept over here in the
last few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw people talk about, you know,
uh, one of the, one of the old guys that
[SPEAKER_03]: used to work for Nevel, um, in the
nineties, uh, dog shit, dog, but no,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually dog shit is a sad thing
because it, it got named dog shit in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon, but before it was an Oregon,
it was from Minneapolis, Minnesota and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's name was electric Boogaloo much
better name, which is one of the coolest
[SPEAKER_03]: names in cannabis in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but for whatever reason it got
changed, but it is also, uh, old early
[SPEAKER_03]: nineties and L five Hayes phenol of some
kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: No bud is an old Afghan from Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it used to be called skunk five in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually know the people that drove it
from, uh, Florida to Oregon where it got
[SPEAKER_03]: renamed snow bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like a lot of things back then,
if you were in Eugene, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_03]: you called it the Eugene snow buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people called it Oregon snow bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, people called it Humboldt snow bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, our buddy CSI has had it for 20 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, probably longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably got it in the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, um, he's made a lot of hybrids
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's an old, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it could be an L it could be an L
five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be any, the earliest name we can
find on this skunk five.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got, and it got renamed snow in
Oregon and it was a very frosty,
[SPEAKER_03]: low turf, uh, old Afghan, kind of like the
white, but better, uh, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, it, it had low flavor,
but there was sometimes when it tasted
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every once in a while you'd hit it out of
a park and it would have really deep,
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot of times though, it was mild or
like the white.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone's ever gotten it to
taste good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's kind of just like a, you know,
it's kind of just like a mild potent
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything tastes good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything's terpy.
