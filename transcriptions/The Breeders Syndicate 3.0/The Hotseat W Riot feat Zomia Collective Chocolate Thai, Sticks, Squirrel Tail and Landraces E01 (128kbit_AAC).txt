[SPEAKER_02]: It costs you nothing, but it helps us
tremendously with the sneaky YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: algorithm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaving comments, telling not so his voice
lulls you into a trance works as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope you take the time to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to put out the best possible shows
for you we can and want to build this
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again from all of us at the
Breeders Syndicate family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_02]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_02]: not so dog, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Brendan from Zomia Collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we're going to be talking about
land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's been going on in Thailand,
the current political climate,
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of what Zomia Collective is all
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, like I said, this is Brendan
from Zomia Collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very special group out in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been speaking with him lately
about what's going on out there and just
[SPEAKER_02]: been totally blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fascinated, interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare in our community where I
run into someone where I feel like their
[SPEAKER_02]: passion is at the true fervor level that
mine is or a lot of my friends are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it's just like, this is what we live
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like Brendan is one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome, Brendan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about passion,
that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we live for here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the type of political activities
you've gotten yourself into and the works
[SPEAKER_02]: you do for social change, it's very,
very humbling to watch from a person way
[SPEAKER_02]: over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I'd love to be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mad props.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about Zomia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what Zomia is in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Zomia is a collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a project that's working on long-term
land-raised conservation in Southeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fundamentally, it's much more than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a social movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a concept in political philosophy and
anthropology that's sort of grounded in an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the indigenous people of
the hilltree tracks of Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sort of non-jurisdictional entity,
which comprises about 100 million people
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking so many different languages,
all of whom are united in a sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: refusal to partake in the state,
in paying taxes, in being conscripted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and instead live in the hills away from
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that unites the region
is the choice of crops, namely cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a foundation in political
activism, which we can get into if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, a sort of nucleus of cannabis
breeders, growers, village elders,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tribal communities formed into a
collective with this purpose of
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation, the land-raised cannabis in
Southeast Asia, perhaps even beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me what kind of pushed you in
this direction?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you grow up?
[SPEAKER_02]: What got you into the Southeast Asia
climate, stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I'm Basque.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from the Basque country, but I grew up
in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of where me and Matthew
were talking, kind of a little bit the
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of trans-boding style of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were buying cannabis from pretty
sketchy places from a pretty young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, for those who know,
you know what the scene is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you catch that bug, and
especially for us, we were really lucky to
[SPEAKER_00]: get stuff like Gold Stamp Bazaar,
Gold Seal, like Black Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite being in a really northern,
remote location, we did benefit from some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sort of the small scale smugglers
before the war on terror and the changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the airports, sort of killed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from then, at 16, I came out to India
and then to Southeast Asia and ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: never leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my formative experiences were
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell into the wine industry,
strangely enough, as a sort of francophone
[SPEAKER_00]: in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this racism, I suppose,
or internalized racism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you want to describe it,
but there's the need for a token French
[SPEAKER_00]: guy to sell wine in the fancy restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter whether he's Basque
or actually French or not, close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a lover of good taste and tiroir
and everything, I always had a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: chip on my shoulder about good food sort
of being so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was my way to be able to taste
what I wanted to taste and to talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: chefs and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was great, but it was also
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got very disillusioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the opportunity to sort of
bring the structure of sommelier in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular to the cannabis world came
about, I jumped on it because it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: culmination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, a 16-year-old me wouldn't
have believed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a dream come true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically lucky enough to be
working in restaurants with a budget high
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to pay for traveling in terms of R
&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pre-COVID, a lot of traveling,
looking for indigenous or traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented beverages for food pairings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Led me and my team to be in contact with a
lot of communities who are also growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the course of spending time in
these communities, learning how they
[SPEAKER_00]: ferment different grains and cereals,
pulses, et cetera, into alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: drinks, the opportunity came about to sort
of learn more about the land-raised
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very nicely timed a few years
before the legalization in Thailand,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gave a little bit more confidence to
us and to others to be able to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: open up because as I'm sure a lot of you
are aware, the penalties for engaging in
[SPEAKER_00]: anything cannabis related in Thailand
before legalization were very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really about timing and
about passion, I guess, and about a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: like-minded individuals with a singular
target, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that target, again, being the
conservation of land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a subject which is pretty
easy to be passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's substance, there's stories,
there's so much to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about like going into
the communities and looking up fermented,
[SPEAKER_02]: different fermented drinks, that's
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us an example, like bang?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they make fermented bang and stuff like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I've actually never seen
fermented bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not out of the bounds of
the imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, we were looking at doing in
this particular context, sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-colonial Indian and Thai recipes and
wondering at our intellectual dishonesty
[SPEAKER_00]: at charging really high prices for French
wine pairings with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a matter of, yeah,
trying to find different sort of unique
[SPEAKER_00]: things which we could bring that value
element to the customer, to the person
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming the beverage of, you know,
a complex drink with a good taste and a
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a lot of them around,
but unfortunately, we don't really find
[SPEAKER_00]: them so much in the big sort of urban city
context where bang might be consumed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bang is a regulated good, so it's sold
in the government shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it outside, of course,
but primarily, at least I associate it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a bit more of an urban context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the drinks, we were more in
Chhattisgarh, in Jharkhand, in Orissa,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tribal region, you know,
mostly grains, rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites in Thailand is called
sato.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different forms, but essentially,
it's a glutinous rice with a little yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: cake called luk bang, which is made from a
bunch of different local herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, you get a little clay pot
and you add your rice and then your luk
[SPEAKER_00]: bang and your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill it up with a little bit of water
and then you seal it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of the jar is sealed off with clay
and that'll be left for a few days and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can just burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a bamboo straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: You burst the clay seal and you just pop
it straight in and drink right out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got the most wonderful like sour,
funky fermentation aromas, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that provided a really
solid base to push the experiment with
[SPEAKER_00]: infusing different, you know, flavors into
it, making it sparkling, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, the equivalent of,
you know, a really expensive wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's something going to be like,
you know, traditional, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: racism in the world of food and,
you know, Thai food, Indian food is very
[SPEAKER_00]: often looked down upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for it to sort of be valued as an
equivalent by something like a Michelin
[SPEAKER_00]: inspector, it needs to really be sort of
extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a sommelier, did you guys,
did a lot of the experience with like
[SPEAKER_02]: jerkings and stuff cross over into
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at the end, in my last job,
that was something that we were playing
[SPEAKER_00]: with quite a lot, the last two jobs,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the beverage director for a group
which included some cocktail bars and a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of restaurants in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were very sort of progressive and
open-minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the owners smoked a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a little bit easier to sort
of swing those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we weren't able to actually roll
it out in the dining room because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: before the legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite, you know, terpenes not having
any cannabis, it's not the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: attention that any sort of restaurant was
looking for at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were playing with it because,
you know, apart from the fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: beverages are talking about, they have
alcohol in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people who don't
consume alcohol in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were looking, yeah, much more at
doing stuff with tea, botanicals of which,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, terpenes key component in almost
any that you look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a stoner, I'm always interested
in sort of, you know, finding some Oji
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush taste in some mad tea from somewhere
or something like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: As you got into the Asian political sphere
and you started making these connections
[SPEAKER_02]: and inroads, what got you then to move
from maybe as much of a preservation of
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand races, which was really,
you know, the main starting goal,
[SPEAKER_02]: into working with the farmers and making
sure the farmers are absolutely taken care
[SPEAKER_02]: of?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see those two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely synonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can go in more into detail if
you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people tagging their indoor grows as
preservation runs, you know, and the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: with zoos is that they're pretty big
entities that require a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: coordination and moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until the advent of pretty strict
regulations and even despite that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be pretty dark places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I think of exit to
conservation, I think of, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: little amateur zoos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a noble effort, but ultimately the
only people who can grow significant
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of open pollinated cannabis
from Landry's genetics is people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional Landry's growing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they don't have to contend,
or at least for now, with all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses that's needed in the West or in
North America and Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to contend, at least until
recently, they didn't need to contend with
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp farms or contamination, those kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm hesitant to say that no
preservation can be done outside because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's pretty obvious that it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, the focus seems to be
so much on getting seeds out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional growing regions and into
cryogenic storage or into long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: growing facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not much thought going into
actually just helping out the farmers who
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing Landry's in the traditional
growing regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeping them growing these
traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like they're already doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of places, including in Thailand,
people are coming over and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, listen, like we need to teach
these guys how to be more profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can sort of keep up with the
modern industry, blah, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the solution answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why this is not the solution
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: By modernizing and changing either the
target of their growth, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: to move away from tariffs to dry sift and
bubble hash in Parvati and other places,
[SPEAKER_00]: this changes the way that the selections
are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite being maybe quite subtle,
they have long lasting consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ultimately, we'd be looking at
providing essentially a subsidy for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that are growing a product,
which unfortunately is not profitable in
[SPEAKER_00]: the modern marketplace, but has
significant value for the community and
[SPEAKER_00]: industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And giving them that incentive to make the
choice to grow these land races,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite the disadvantages that are created
by legislation, policy, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, everybody has families
to take care of and wants to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when faced with a choice of,
or not necessarily the choice,
[SPEAKER_00]: when faced with having a long standing
land race growth, no more customers and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that all it would take is to
switch to a modern cultivar for your
[SPEAKER_00]: market to suddenly open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a choice which almost every land
race farmer is facing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to give them a reason to be
like hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep doing what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me a little bit of the
multi-state operators dropping the prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, below a sustainable price for
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they can afford to sustain
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that loss for a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels like the same situation with
land race farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like everybody sort of recognizes the
value of what they have, but nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: really willing to actually hook them up or
even able really to buy their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just kind of going to
disappear in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we hope to address and to
redress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we do essentially is we
approach the, it depends who we're
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching in land, but if we can,
we're approaching the community as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole, the village elder or village chief
or whatever the equivalent is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, coming up with some sort of
agreement for them to continue growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: land races and for us to make an attempt
at, you know, offering their germplasm and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to the international community for
which to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that, you know, people back
home don't need to be concerned with
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation if we actually let the pros
take care of it in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can have fun creating all
the crazy hybrids from the phenohunt,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be done each year in such a,
you know, genetically diverse population,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way we see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole way that you approach it is
very, I don't know, just socially
[SPEAKER_02]: conscious to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that's been lacking a
lot in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people that I've seen
over the years tend to maybe, I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to say exploit the farmers, but it's hard
to say anything other than that because
[SPEAKER_02]: they try to get the cheapest absolute
price so that they can then take a cut off
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how they make their money,
you know, but back, it all goes back to
[SPEAKER_02]: what is the incentive for the farmers to
keep growing these when people come to
[SPEAKER_02]: them like, without using any of the names,
like a big seed company, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from Amsterdam that says, Hey,
we'd rather you have you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you give us your land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll store these in germ plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow some of these feminine seeds
in the meantime, you know, like this is
[SPEAKER_02]: how, this is how things disappear for
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate your work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look, I mean, I don't think that we're
going to be able to, to prevent the land
[SPEAKER_00]: races going extinct, unfortunately,
but we'll definitely do what we can with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the communities that are willing
to work with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try and keep what we can for as long as
we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately it's going to require a
concerted effort on behalf of the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, there needs to be a demand for
Tijuana driven products and a clear
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what Tijuana driven
products are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, I think a lot of people,
they want to have that experience of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian gold or the Thai stick that they
had back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that was all imported
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to return to experiences
like that, we need to consider a
[SPEAKER_00]: normalization of trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that's so, so far away, it seems to
make sense to support the land race
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in the meantime, by breeding with
their genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's define land race as you see it,
as you understand it, because that's super
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hate to do that actually,
because, well, not I don't hate to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just think that there's a lot of
opinions and a lot of words out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see why we need to reinvent the
wheel every time, you know, like my take
[SPEAKER_00]: is not as interesting or I think as
accurate as the numerous studies which
[SPEAKER_00]: have been published over the last few
decades, you know, dealing with land races
[SPEAKER_00]: and also specifically defining land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that I can actually
remember the name of the authors of the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a paper called towards an evolved
concept of land races, which basically
[SPEAKER_00]: it's looking at the history of the
definition of the term and making a
[SPEAKER_00]: proposal that land races should be
considered as basically dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: population, which can be subjected to
introgression while still retaining their
[SPEAKER_00]: designation as land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because the earliest
definitions of land race, von Grumker,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, but even, you know,
until Zevin, which I think was 1998,
[SPEAKER_00]: were much more about static.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the land race is a monolithic,
never changing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it becomes polluted, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's the case, then they're
destined for the museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll never, you know, that's not
my, that's a quote from the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they'll, they'll never get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one sense, that makes a lot of sense
in one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense to me on the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the implication of this sort
of evolved understanding of land races is
[SPEAKER_00]: underlined by a worldview or sorry,
maybe sort of a structured by a worldview,
[SPEAKER_00]: which cannot consider a future where
indigenous people might be sort of left in
[SPEAKER_00]: peace to grow alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the paper can't even
consider that, which bothers me
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentally, because as a naive dreamer,
I suppose, I'd like to imagine a future
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, everybody could be left
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose that is somewhat unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, given the context,
the capitalism will continue to expand
[SPEAKER_00]: into every single possible market that it
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land race, cannabis in traditional growing
regions, far away from the nearest road
[SPEAKER_00]: city, no exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if that's the case, then I think
that that paper does make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we, if we are going to integrate these
communities into the global economy and
[SPEAKER_00]: their crops into the global economy as
commodities, then certainly there needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be some sort of new look at how we define
land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would basically say, yeah, go,
go read the studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't listen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got nothing fresh to say on the
definition of land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm a bit boring on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to defer to the, to the
scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, some people will insert
their, their opinions as facts,
[SPEAKER_02]: state it very confidently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that, you know, and,
and the real answer is, man, just got to
[SPEAKER_02]: do the check up the research and stay up
to date with the research.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's changing, you know,
and it has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the way we interpret the study
ourselves, you know, the, I read it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow we come up with two slightly
different conclusions, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would rather instead of, um,
cause I see that something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm constantly having these
conversations and I feel like instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly reinventing the wheel and
giving our opinions as to what the
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions of these things are,
we should maybe be doing more reading as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community and, and seeing what,
you know, um, the biologist has to say
[SPEAKER_00]: about land races, because there's a lot of
work done for corn land races for weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and despite the fact that there's very
few cannabis specific studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, there's a lot of studies on similar
organisms, hops, et cetera, that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: learn a lot from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people that are watching this,
probably one of the reasons they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to come to watch a show about Thailand
races.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the chocolate tie?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the first question I get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've worked with a line.
[SPEAKER_02]: On chocolate tie from a dude named draw
who supposedly sourced it from the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that DNA Don and Aaron sourced it from to
make chocolate back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's of course all these fantastic
legends and fables of pasta dipped,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, heroin infused cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these tales of what chocolate
tie is in your experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you learned about chocolate pie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, very, very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the, the message here
is that, um, in Thailand, the area which
[SPEAKER_00]: produced cannabis, the largest area,
Isan, um, was incredibly like really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really poor until quite recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that farmers were sort of
walking around eating Nestle chocolate and
[SPEAKER_00]: naming things mean not saying that no one
had ever heard of chocolate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies, but it's an English word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in my opinion, a pretty sort of
pretty clearly it's hard for farmers who,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, had some accession or selection,
um, or bags of weed with seeds in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they had, you know, a chocolate,
I really, cause I really can't speak on
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all I can speak of is, you know,
having gone through the motions myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: asking pretty much everybody that I can
deal with chocolate tie and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: being met with the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One issue is that, um, a lot of the
traditional knowledge here in Thailand has
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of slowly been sort of dissipating
and becoming unstructured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the young ones are learning
from the same sources that we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll meet some, especially ethnic
high, like they'll be maybe aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if you rocked up to Thailand in
a few years ago and you asked for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have got something and they
would have told you it was chocolate pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak for anything like that,
but what I can say is that as far as large
[SPEAKER_00]: open pollinated populations of cannabis
that we could describe as land race that
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers are sort of engaging with and
in their head, conceiving of as chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: tie, that doesn't exist as far as I'm
aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I can say though, um,
to give people some, some hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, um, the, the aroma of chocolate,
um, also that of coffee, um, dark earthy
[SPEAKER_00]: musty aromas are very typical of narrow
leaf drug type land race when it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: subjected to compression curing,
uh, which I think a lot of you will know
[SPEAKER_00]: as tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, um, I guess when you have this
sort of, um, this mechanical pressure plus
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, um, plus time, we see
significant impact on the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when we can add anaerobic conditions
on occasion aging underground or these
[SPEAKER_00]: days in vacuum seals, um, we do see some
pretty funky aromas coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that's quite consistent is a
sort of earthy chocolatey character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's something that I've,
I've had a lot in my time in Southeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia, in Laos, in Cambodia and Myanmar and
elsewhere with the older, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: six months plus cured stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't want to speculate too much,
but I think it would be interesting if it
[SPEAKER_00]: turned out to be some sort of,
uh, you know, terpene, um, which care,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was sort of, uh, maybe
biosynthesized, um, during this aging
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, it was leading to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be a combination of
different compounds, which are leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, there's definitely
something to research there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for those interested in the
chocolate pie, your best bet is the fino
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt, the Lao yi san jin pu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so for that, you can approach
squirrel tail, tiger tail, Thai mango,
[SPEAKER_00]: snake teeth, um, a bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, you'll find pretty
consistently, you know, applying these
[SPEAKER_00]: compression curing techniques that you'll
have these chocolate aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're delicious, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you nail it, you're looking at a
slow degradation of the chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, leaving almost everything else intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've got a very smooth smoke,
um, which doesn't have this sort of full
[SPEAKER_00]: green character, which chlorophyll brings,
which is so ubiquitous to smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say as a note that, um,
you know, just as sort of curiosity,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of times we've had some,
some, some professional sommeliers coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into our, our, we were partnered with a
dispensary in Bangkok and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: total of 64 strains in the, in the,
in the shop front now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we let all the sommeliers smell them
and they're like, yeah, next, next,
[SPEAKER_00]: next, next, next.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to the compression cured Lao gold
land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Oh, what's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's the only one that doesn't smell
green and doesn't have that chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in wine green is an aroma that's very
sort of, uh, we, it's, it's viewed as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a flaw almost, almost universally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I think that there's,
there's something to be explored there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's a reason why so
many people are in love with this
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate pie with the myth of it,
with the story, because there is something
[SPEAKER_00]: there that, you know, rewarding,
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just don't think it's a strain,
a strain proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's interesting is growing up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in, in the nineties, earlier than
nineties, uh, getting a lot of Mexican
[SPEAKER_02]: compressed constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that Mexican press brick,
I've always said, it smelled like minty
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate, but definitely a cocoa type
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted, I mean, it was compression
cured and sat forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of speaks to what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you mentioned, of course, the infamous
tiger tail squirrel tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we start talking about some of these
different, uh, what you would call like
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe an expression of these different
land races or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's gone really confusing and
that's the picture that I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the way I'm explaining it's probably
going to be a bit confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm explaining is very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, essentially the first attestation to
the word squirrel tail in the Lao script,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that we saw was in reference to,
um, traditional kit, uh, weaving,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a style or, but the squirrel tail
is a pattern found in traditional kit
[SPEAKER_00]: weaving, which today is practiced in silk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one day I'd like to find if I
can, uh, a traditional Thai or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a weaving historian,
if that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they, did they make it with hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that would be my immediate hunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, squirrel tail, the tiger tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these are many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's all down to the, the Lao,
we can call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on both sides of the Mekong in Thailand
and Laos, um, live speakers in the Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referred to as a region as Isan or
the Korat plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially the, the words that are
used to describe cannabis of a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: archetype, um, are squirrel tail,
tiger tail, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So squirrel tail describes like a big,
like cheerleader, like pom-pom style buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like really like, like big,
like lots of leaves, like puffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the tiger tail is the,
it's more like the creeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it referred to in English as a
creeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Robert Clark described creepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot of lateral branching low
to the ground with these branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes forming new roots and then big
swoopy main colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strangely the English translation,
um, for tiger tail is sometimes rendered
[SPEAKER_00]: as rudder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure who got confused,
the English speakers of the Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of the Thais have also been
telling me that, no, this is rudder as in
[SPEAKER_00]: like boat rudder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something they'd be most used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but in that sense,
I'm thinking just like a long upright
[SPEAKER_00]: rigid object, but you know, cause if you
look at some of the tiger tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really do like, they have this huge
main top cola and then the branching is
[SPEAKER_00]: all really low to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's quite a, as with a lot of these
things, there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: stories, but so far, you know,
the, we were able to differentiate between
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the, the structure on these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then also the structure for the
Thai for the snake teeth, um, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the vine-like growth kind of like Dr.
Grinspoon, where you have the running
[SPEAKER_00]: calic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the mango or would be the,
you know, the mercy and rich, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's also pretty common to find
mango aromas in squirrel tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: tiger tail and the snake teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately I think that originally it
would have been a singular gene pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: which during its dissemination and the
cross-cultural contact between the Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lao and other groups in the region,
um, seeds were exchanged, plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up with both autochthonous,
um, you know, land race population,
[SPEAKER_00]: big open pollinated population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sorry, autochthonous and aloctonous in
different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a bunch of inbred lines, some single
plants, um, reproductions from single
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you know, multiplied into millions
and then disseminated and then met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them carry the same names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think it's best understood,
you know, as, um, archetypes within the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool that has since become
established as their own land races and in
[SPEAKER_00]: some cases, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like modern strains as an IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them coexisting, uh,
temporally and geographically in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, pollinating each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like really, really,
really complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we basically have done our best to
ignore everything that we sort of hear and
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on what we see and look for large
open pollinated populations that breed
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they seem to have, you know,
um, seem to express what we consider to
[SPEAKER_00]: look more like a primordial character.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, as long as the population
size is big enough and it's grown in open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination, then, you know, that fits
the, the, the base criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're, we're looking to collect
from everything, but what we're sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting involved in heavily is,
is what we can determine to be the more,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to use the word pure because
it's thought accurate, but the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff which is grown properly,
um, managed properly, um, and not just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, every single little thing that
we can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause honestly, it's a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at this point since legalization,
every single uncle, you know, whoever had
[SPEAKER_00]: a single plant in his back garden,
making seeds and selling them,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, giving them away, you know,
people are selling clones for about 30
[SPEAKER_00]: cents a clone on the side of the street in
Bangkok out of little trucks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this really intense sort of
mixing and hybridization of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: going on at the moment, but that's just
sort of the culmination of the last,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, 40, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as the Lao Isan gene pool is
concerned, um, we've been looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that, you know, look like a
squirrel tail, look like a tiger tail and
[SPEAKER_00]: are kept in big open pollinated grows in
fairly remote regions where we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically that's taken us out of Isan
for the most part, um, and into the,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the more hilly regions where we can
find that, you know, we can get that
[SPEAKER_00]: distance that's required to, you know,
to, to totally prevent the cross
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've done, you've done a lot of work
in Thailand to, you know, try to pick
[SPEAKER_02]: apart a lot of these stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, it seems like Xomi has kind
of spread out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other areas that you've been
really excited about that you've been
[SPEAKER_02]: looking into?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've talked about, you know,
around Thailand, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other places in there that
you're excited about or elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Cambodia is, you know, the place that
I spent the most time personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a really soft spot for,
for Cambodia and one of my best friends
[SPEAKER_00]: are, are Cambodian people that,
you know, they were little rascals and now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're big rascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking forward to being able
to, to return there probably this year and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at what we can do to expand our
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, try and see if we can recruit some,
some different communities into,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the collective and bring up some new
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise Laos, you know, that's always
one of the most interesting regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're, you know, the Thai
nationalism prevents them from admitting
[SPEAKER_00]: how good the Laotian weed is and the
Laotian reverse with the Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're both excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a lot of synergy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, Laos has a few iconic,
um, areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producing, you know, land-raised cannabis
that we're really looking forward to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to, uh, in particular, the,
the sea pandan, the, the, the 4,000
[SPEAKER_00]: islands, um, which is basically an area of
the Mekong, uh, where there's cataracts on
[SPEAKER_00]: the border with Cambodia and Laos and
Mekong spreads out into these loads of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty well-known tourist
destination, a place where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you know, fond memories of kicking
back and fishing and smoking great pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, from the sixties onwards, and it has,
you know, there's, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: places left on the Mekong, the islands,
which grow this beautiful golden weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which all the old-timers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's probably going to be one of
the priorities in terms of where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily grown, um,
within the main areas, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: along the cataract, there's, there's a lot
of people growing here and there and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking forward to getting some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, golden Mekong weed, Laos,
that's going to be, I think that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a big hit with the old-timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there's a lot of stuff in the
north of the country near the border with
[SPEAKER_00]: Yunnan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then of course the, the Bo Lavin
Plateau, um, that's beautiful coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: growing region with a significant amount
of, uh, local population belonging to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavin ethnic group, who's very talented
cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's so much in Laos that we can
explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a very, very diverse country,
very small, but with a lot of diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in cannabis and the people,
the landscapes and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myanmar, unfortunately is, um,
you know, I mean, it feels a bit silly
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, unfortunately in the context of
seeds, because that's not really what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it sad, obviously, but Myanmar is
undergoing, you know, uh, severe political
[SPEAKER_00]: upheaval, civil war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if anybody, um, you know, wants to,
wants to help out, they're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers in Chiang Mai right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go and, uh, sign up to go fight
for the, for the militias that are
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting against the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's absolute chaos out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been getting really, really,
really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, uh, we were not doing
anything in Myanmar right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound very safe right now,
or, or, I mean, people's priorities are
[SPEAKER_02]: different right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People's priorities are different and we
don't feel like, um, we've spoken to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to our contacts out there and we
theoretically could get seeds out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it just, again, it doesn't seem like a
priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think the priority probably seems to
be for us now to continue focusing on our
[SPEAKER_00]: work in Cambodia, Laos, um, and in the
Northeast of India in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we're also very, very excited to,
to be bringing out some, some Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics hopefully soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're all very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is a lot of similarities with the
Thai it seems between, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Caribbean and Latin American gene
pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're looking forward to having closer
collaboration with us and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, members of our collective in that
group and together try to build a better
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of, you know, what's going on with
the land races between the two regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what are similarities in the,
in the semi outdoor curing styles with
[SPEAKER_00]: golden weed as a result, that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our, um, yeah, our boys are based
in Calca, but they're mobile, so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking forward to bringing out some,
some genetics from there pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty, pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, pretty sure the next drop or the,
the current drop is, I just, we just came
[SPEAKER_00]: back from, from Himachal Pradesh,
but, uh, I think next is going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: that order, Thailand, Cambodia,
Laos, followed by, followed by India
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about some of the current
recent accessions that you got,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that are on your site right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people have a, uh, an understanding for
you other than what you write.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, uh, like that's kind of what
initially drew me to you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a good friend of Neville's, um,
sent me to your site and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to check these guys out,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't, and it's not just,
it's not just descriptions like lulling
[SPEAKER_02]: you in with, you know, words and
marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how you collected it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how you listed the accessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done very well, like in my opinion,
very scientifically and all the details
[SPEAKER_02]: that people need to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of people will of course be
wondering like, what does this taste and
[SPEAKER_02]: smell like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the THC content?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like what's the high?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and not, not understanding that
like they're thinking of it from a very
[SPEAKER_02]: modern mindset of what's this going to be
like in my room indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just, it's not something you can
really tell them, you know, how this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that grows outdoors in, in this expresses
in this environment, how it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors in your environment where it's
never been, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So please talk about some of your,
your more recent accessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what people can expect.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like, uh, like you said,
we don't really, we don't really put,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like expected yields or,
you know, we do, we do go into therapy
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles a little bit, but you know,
not massively and certainly not THC
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to note that, you know,
we've found some accessions in Cambodia,
[SPEAKER_00]: which have very few trichome heads on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they absolutely flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just going to go ahead and go
on a limb and say that, maybe there's even
[SPEAKER_00]: some other cannabinoids that play there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, measuring,
you know, that strange quality or that
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions quality based on its THC
percentage just seems like an absurdity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many missing cannabinoids out
there like that we don't, that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: tested for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no clue what is causing some of
these highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far as the most recent exceptions,
we were in Parvati Valley, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is, you know, one of the, the true
hotspots of land races in the world in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's maybe not as much of a priority
as far as conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmers there are pretty,
pretty well off and doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they don't really need our help
in the same way that farmers in Southeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia do, but it's important to us because
Parvati is one of the most visible,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most famous of the growing
regions in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, without having,
you know, a few pictures and some
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions from Malana, it's really hard
to have that clout as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a land race collective, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where Malana is in Parvati Valley
or is it called a valley?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Parvati is in the state of Himachal
Pradesh, which basically means like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Himachal province and
Himachal is like a heavenly mountain,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in Bihari.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the, it's, you know, the,
the place outside of Kathmandu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically a lot of Parvati Valley is
in, is in Himachal Pradesh, which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the North of India near the, near the
border with, with China and not so far
[SPEAKER_00]: away from Pakistan, Kashmir is in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the Northwest of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically a hub for cannabis
growing since the, since the 1960s as one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sort of the tail ends of the,
of the hippocampus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hippy trail, you know, other than
Kathmandu and Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And starting, I'm not exactly sure when,
but you know, I would say maybe late
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies, early eighties, a lot of
Italians coming to Parvati, La Paz and
[SPEAKER_00]: Malana villages in particular,
and, and getting involved with charis
[SPEAKER_00]: production there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's had a big international
reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Europe, Parvati hash is not
necessarily the most common, but in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of places in Italy, in the Scandinavian
countries is one of the prestige hash that
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is available on offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, it, it's, it seemed like,
you know, a very, a priority, let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, because, you know, when
foreigners are learning and educating
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves about land races, one of the
first places that they learn about is
[SPEAKER_00]: generally Malana, Kasol, Tosh,
this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, we felt like in order to bring
attention to smaller villages in other
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of India and in other countries in
Thailand, that it was in the best interest
[SPEAKER_00]: of approaching and working with the
farmers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but the farmers there,
they're not, conservation is needed
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, but Malana and maybe not
Malana, but Parvati Valley as a whole is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of one of the more stable,
one of the larger land race producing
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people there are holding on to their
traditions pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not necessarily an area where
we can engage in necessarily the same type
[SPEAKER_00]: of conservation work that we can in tribal
regions in the north east of India or
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's somewhere where we, you know,
could source some very high quality seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from very, very famous gardens,
maybe, you know, do our part in helping to
[SPEAKER_00]: build up the body of knowledge for what
could eventually be an appellation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that, that in particular is
something that on a personal level,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it'd be a privilege to be
involved in anything even remote to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Parvati is one of the grand cru,
so to speak, of the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, it's a storied place
with a big diversity of, in French we call
[SPEAKER_00]: them Leudy and Clima.
[SPEAKER_00]: They refer to the smallest geographic
designation basically individual plots,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes having multiple within one
vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in Parvati, we see a
similar system with very small individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plots, making up a constellation that
forms a larger sort of system that spreads
[SPEAKER_00]: out the whole valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that provides us with a lot of
different expressions, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of that gene pool from the various sort of
terroir of the area, whether they be the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark side of the valley with a lot of
humidity, a lot of rain, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best, most sunny spots at high
altitude above Malana village,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in total, we made 74 accessions,
which I, maybe it's, I don't need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just want to point out like how much
tracking was involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, gardens that are, you know,
between, let's say 2,100 to 3,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,000 meters, basically at the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between, well, like 6,000 to almost
12,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the villages, for example,
Tosh, maybe I don't actually know the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact altitude of Tosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rassol is 2,600 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Vairam fields above it are hitting
3,000, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to get up to Rassol and
then up to the fields beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similarly to in Southeast Asia,
where next to the rice fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's these little huts where they dry
out a lot of the products and where they
[SPEAKER_00]: rest during the hot parts of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rubbing houses in a lot of the
higher fields in Parvati.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the time we were hanging
out with the boys there and asking them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, you know, what's the name
of this garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the name of that garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, can you make sure you separate
plants from those two next time you rub,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll give you more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, they think we're stupid because
they're like, why would the foreigner pay
[SPEAKER_00]: more just for knowing that it comes from
one garden and not the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, let's put some
fucking stamps on the charas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very Western mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's rewarding and it helps
the farmers to differentiate their product
[SPEAKER_00]: without having any change on the product
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps us, again, to bring a better,
clearer picture of what is going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool in that area and to represent
that visually, the text and with our
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were telling a story yesterday about
hand rubbing that I thought was
[SPEAKER_02]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the one thing that like as a
person who might have a few OCDs,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the idea of hand rubbing,
like to me is skin cells and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand the tradition and the
quality that goes along with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had an interesting story about
like how bad it can screw up your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me a little bit about that so
people can understand what goes into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm actually what I didn't mean to
emphasize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, like the I think the eyelashes
are more of a concern than really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you like you'll never even really
see the skin cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just notice that your hands feel a
bit papery and thin.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, if you let them dry
out afterwards, they'll get all ragged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you'll often notice little
eyelashes because they're always hunched
[SPEAKER_00]: over when they're.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when they're rubbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you know, everybody,
all the foreigners, they come up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Parvati for the first time and they have
it in their head that they're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, run naked through the field of
weed, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably could if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you'd get some stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also want to say before I
before I say anything else, because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these conversations in the past have
led to people going to where we've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about on the back of me explaining where
the grows are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Milano Valley and you touch
any plants, expect to pay about a five
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred dollar fine for every plant that
you touch every time you touch one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not so keen on foreigners coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other places in the job,
you can probably run naked through the
[SPEAKER_00]: fields as you imagine you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the the first thing is
like, OK, well, I'm not going to buy hash
[SPEAKER_00]: while I'm here because I'm a cannabis nerd
and I know how it's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to rub it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wake up early and go up and rub and
rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that unless you're doing
this regularly, it takes a big toll on
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are somewhat caustic and
you're applying a lot of pressure onto
[SPEAKER_00]: your palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically when you're collecting
the matter at the end, you're pressing
[SPEAKER_00]: your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it pretty bad on your joints
pretty quickly, but you'll notice blisters
[SPEAKER_00]: on your thumb if your technique isn't on
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, yeah, for people who have
these kind of like, you know, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: OCD or just, you know, being concerned
about hygiene, which is reasonable,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I get that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even see the skin cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like even when I when I'm like doing
that at home, like going through picking
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and I've got like caked,
caked resin on my hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I smoke this, it's not really
going to be perfect, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also also knowing about Melana cream
that is like in my mind, like supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: be what the ultimate hash what I
understand a lot of cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, there's no way any skin
cell would make me pass up some Melana
[SPEAKER_02]: cream to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the top level cream will have
very few skin cells in it because the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole point of cream is for it to be very
delicately rubbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you do rub it delicately,
there's, you know, and also we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, for someone with soft
hands who doesn't rub every year,
[SPEAKER_00]: then yeah, it's going to be filled with
skin cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a very calloused hand, not so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say though, that during the season,
you'll find the whole village is empties
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, in a way you could child
exploitation or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's not really like they have
such thing as childcare up in the hills
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll leave the kids at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come with and the whole family rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you better believe that the dad is
going to tell you later, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yo, this was my 16 year old daughter who
rubbed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her hands are really soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay more for this, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always like, no, no, this is the
youngest, you know, the, this is my wife
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's always the wife daughter who's the
highest price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very typical though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there like, you mentioned Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other like pie in the sky,
like ideas you want to pull off with Zomia
[SPEAKER_02]: that you haven't yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to, I mean, a lot of things we'd
love to, to get more into the production
[SPEAKER_00]: and aging and then selling of tie stick
and charis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are what we're passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional compression curing and
traditional hand rubbing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the artisanal crafts, which don't
involve the mediation of many tools or
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery in the elaboration of
traditional cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always going to be something that
we want to get involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, maybe if you'll allow me,
want to go back a little bit to Milana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think, I think that there's a
bit more nuance that needs to be explained
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the cream, the charis is rubbed
from domesticated plants, which over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the last 25 years in particular,
every single farmer who has been around
[SPEAKER_00]: long enough to see it talks about a
decline in THC levels and in trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it went from being a lesser amount
of plants needed to rub 10 grams to a much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher amount of 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my personal experiences in India
were not in Parvati Valley, actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: first ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in mostly in Kinnaar and Spiti
in the more remote regions of Himachal
[SPEAKER_00]: Pradesh, where there's much less of a
tourist drug trade and much more of local
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there the charis is referred to as
jungli, jungli being the word which gave
[SPEAKER_00]: us the word in English for jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means forest in Hindi and is forest
hash in that regards can be thought of as
[SPEAKER_00]: hash rubbed from feral plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the hash rub from feral plants,
in my opinion, that is the pinnacle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world of charis because not only have the
domesticated plants been losing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really explain much more about
why, but the testimony of the farmers that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're losing THC content over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the feral plants are becoming
irrelevant with very few people outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, for example, in Kulu, which is at
the bottom of the valley, it's a much
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger city outside of Parvati,
you'll find drug addicts like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, going and rubbing hands worth
from the feral plants on the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: road that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more and more in the main sort of
producing villages like Rasool,
[SPEAKER_00]: Malana, there are far less feral plants
now than there were before because the
[SPEAKER_00]: feral plants are often the first to be
targeted in in eradication campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops will come and put a little bit of
pressure and the cops themselves probably
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be clearing the field, but they'll
be telling the villagers to clear the
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll clear the feral plants below
the village that are in plain view of the
[SPEAKER_00]: path that goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't satisfy the cops,
then maybe they'll cut down a few
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticate fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that really the sort of the
pinnacle, the holy grail, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it, is the the jungly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all jungly is equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be from an army who can rub
very well and can rub a good quality cream
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly without much contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if he rubs from feral plants,
you can expect a bigger diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes, which,
you know, when consumed fresh or aged,
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to a much more pronounced and
distinct experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where the magic of
Parvati and Charas in general is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is live resin made from, you know,
live plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funnily enough, all the Gora, you know,
all the foreigners, they're pretty excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about consuming it fresh because that's
when it's really terpy, but also quite
[SPEAKER_00]: caustic on the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the locals swear by smoking it after a
year when it's lost a lot of its taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's much smoother and provides a more
sedative, narcotic kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going out there and trying all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the locals are like,
because they produce a lot, but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a lot of the best grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You normally need to commission that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted, say a few kilos of super
cream or something, you'd need to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: advance and say, I want you to make,
and you need to trust and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're sort of going there on
the spot and asking them, give me your
[SPEAKER_00]: best stuff, they're kind of like,
don't smoke it too quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, here, I'm on a mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try everything as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better believe, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, usually my, I have my co-host
Nato with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now I would be making a joke
about sending him over to suitcase some
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of cream and bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: The old traditional suitcase, if you get
my drift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember back in, I was in Denmark for a
little brief period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Met a Danish chick and they're pretty
famous for bringing, bringing the dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, they got this little hippie
commune there that sort of where
[SPEAKER_00]: anarchists call me in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's changed a lot, but basically
there's kind of this marketplace and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all, it's changed a lot, a lot,
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but back in the day, I remember there
was always a ass hash or briefcase hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like eggs or super flat or bricks of
Kashmiri that came God knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was always like the briefcase hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How often did you choose the ass hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't like, you know,
like, you know, like, uh, there's that
[SPEAKER_00]: study with Madrid where they found that
like every sample of, uh, of, of hash that
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they found was contaminated fecal
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever heard of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think, you know, I'm not,
that's definitely not something I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in order to maybe sort of
contextualize this and, um, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else that might seem a little bit odd
about hygiene that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think I'd like to sort of,
um, explain a little bit about how,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, an analogy in winemaking
would maybe be the most, uh, illustrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's that when you have an old
winery with, you know, very porous walls
[SPEAKER_00]: from an old traditional building,
you know, one that wasn't built,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, up to code or according to what
some bureaucrats wanted just traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: building, you know, people knocked it up
cause they needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those walls will accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeast and all these things over long,
long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're talking about a country,
which has, you know, a heavy bureaucracy,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when it comes to things like
food products, you know, the U S does not
[SPEAKER_00]: allow like, I mean, maybe this has
changed, but I remember like it was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: deal that the U S didn't allow like raw
cow's milk cheese, which is like the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The live, you know, lactic, uh,
bacteria culture leads to much more
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity of taste and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there are huge, big hygiene,
you know, concerns in the U S which
[SPEAKER_00]: confuses me because I also get told on the
other side that standards are lax compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think without being a chauvinist
or without trying to, um, I'd like to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I guess, praise the,
the, the, the Europeans for having that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of, uh, ability to be very hygienic
when they think that it matters for
[SPEAKER_00]: example, during the harvesting of the
grapes and everything else, but allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: certain contaminants during other parts of
the process because they're either a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the traditional method or they have
some sort of an impact on the taste or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that regards, I kind of place
the skin cells in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, if you're a craft beer drinker,
you'll probably seen the Brett beer that's
[SPEAKER_00]: came about in the last sort of 10 years or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, um, we describe it as like
barnyard aromas and smells, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we find it very typically in,
well, it's, it's caused by a bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: infection, which you can get rid of
through proper hygiene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it a lot in French wines and you
know, the Americans, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they have tasting panels when the
supermarkets are going to buy like onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the side of the leader of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, and it took,
you know, decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the craft beer hipsters to come
out and be like, no, these bacterias are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to incorporate them,
you know, voluntarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's changing the mind,
but there is a big difference sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, there's a big difference in,
um, the, the way that traditional tea
[SPEAKER_00]: water and products are conceived of and
the requirements, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, um, where I come from might say
that if you create a formula and you
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitize everything, then it can't express
the soil and the culture and the life,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so bear that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel a little bit disgusted by
finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's one of those things
where it's like, Hey, I can't see it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in my, in the back of my mind,
it's always there, you know, someone's
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get, you know, I will, I'll tell you
what, what you really should worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, this is a significant concern
actually is, is adulterance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, adulterance, um, caused by the,
I mean, the size of the, of the fields in
[SPEAKER_00]: place like Parvati or in Uttrakhand,
they've increased massively, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 fold to a hundred fold or in different
places over the course of the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, and they still can't quite meet,
um, demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's always sort of a
lack of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, in Parvati, the backstop
is made up by, um, Nepalese who themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: make up the, the laboring class in
Himachal Pradesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also often rub hash on contract
for Himachali landowners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can't meet their quotas,
they'll incorporate a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepalese Valley hash into, into the Milana
to bulk it out so they can get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: price per gram from their landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then down in the, in the Valley,
it's definitely being contaminated or
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterated with all sorts of things like
dupe, like incense sticks, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: henna, um, just mud, random crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just in order to, to, to, you know,
bulk it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I don't know, explain why they
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows why they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but when you were getting on the top
quality and you know, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: adulterated, what then you need to make
sure, you know, you're probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to rub it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're worried about hygiene is that
they do stuff like when they're first
[SPEAKER_00]: starting, they'll rub their eyebrows in
order to get some oil on their fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll provide the first,
um, you know, cause what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is you're trying to lift the trichomes
off of the, off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the, they need, you need good
weather conditions and you need your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the basically the perfect humidity
and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're too dry or something,
it's not going to rub properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your hands do need to be conditioned,
somehow the easiest way is to spit on them
[SPEAKER_00]: or to rub your hair, to rub behind your
ears, to rub your eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most oily part of your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to save them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, honestly, I probably
shouldn't be saying this stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: international politics, but it's the
truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, when you're combusting it,
you're burning the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand the icky part of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, it's, it's just one of those
things as an OCD person like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, yeah, but I, I can get over it
pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes to me either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just think back to the shit that
was in like hard drugs that I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's finger, like worrying
about skin compared to some of the cut
[SPEAKER_02]: that was in hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just, it seems, uh, silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people that are going to be
going to your site after watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, which is, um, Zomia Cannabis Co.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zomia Cannabis Co.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do start by consensus and the
consensus was an unwieldy and cumbersome
[SPEAKER_00]: website name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the advantages of being,
uh, you know, a collective led by
[SPEAKER_00]: consensus, but yeah, Zomia Cannabis Co
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the first questions that people
are going to be asking, and I know you're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably going to get a hundred emails
about this after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured maybe let's just try to curb
some of the emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, what's one of the lines you would
recommend for a California indoor garden
[SPEAKER_02]: from your indoor light garden from your,
um, selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there's like, um,
it's kind of like the Chinese restaurants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the UK or the U S you know,
people feel more comfortable with kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like an intermediary or familiarity of
some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetened version, perhaps a little bit
less spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that regards, I think some of
the Landrace IBLs can be quite appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: for growers who lack the confidence to
approach, you know, a long flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in that regards, the, the,
the classic sort of, uh, lowland Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: stick accession from us would be the Dai
Deng, um, which is the transliteration for
[SPEAKER_00]: red thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's the legendary red thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that would be a little bit,
you know, shorter flowering, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit, you know, more, it's still
going to have a lot of vigor, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a bit more uniform in its
canopy and its growth patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as the, the sort of the very
equatorial lines, I think that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: really approachable line for beginners
saying that, um, the picture, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's on the background here of the,
of the post of the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a, a skull Karen, um,
genetics from the Kincra Chan national
[SPEAKER_00]: park area on the border with Myanmar and
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it's huge plant grows really
vigorously, you know, resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to walk much, don't need to
feed it much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just grows like hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if space isn't your concern,
you know, then, you know, you can consider
[SPEAKER_00]: going for something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but ultimately, if you're working with
really stretchy, long flowering varietals
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, there are quite a few tricks
that you can take, um, to both shorten the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and to manage the canopy more
evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can get a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to be wanting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I would say, that if you have the
ability, if you're not a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even if you are, and you have the
ability to sacrifice a space or a cycle in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to do phenol hunts, I think that's
the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the idea of, you know, stabilizing
phenols, and also you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with the intersex traits that are
common in the land race gene pools of
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, breeding with those can
be a bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, doing mass selections,
phenol hunts based on big amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: then putting your, your cuttings from
select mothers directly into flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: small plots with a high planting density,
you can turn pretty, pretty fast cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can get really good yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say, if you have the
ability to do so, please attempt to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: this, uh, this path as it's probably the
most commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, otherwise, um, the Indian land races
from the Himalayas, um, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be somewhat shorter than the ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the difference would be 24 to 20 weeks
or 20 to six weeks, not huge, but still if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, if you're somebody who struggles
to maintain the plant's health during long
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering periods, then maybe you're
looking, you know, to shorten that down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that in the, in the cultivars
from higher altitude and from more
[SPEAKER_00]: northerly locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in general, your, your Tiber idols,
your Cambodians, your Laotians are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be depending on, you know, you and your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen seven meter plants in the
village in Sagaing in Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's your upper limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally speaking, LST, a lot of
pruning, a lot of cutting back,
[SPEAKER_00]: topping, et cetera, the techniques that
can benefit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you have the ability to let the
plants grow without any sort of topping,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do respond better.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are not used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being individually coddled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're land-raised plants coming from
huge fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers do not pay attention to single
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fields are too far away, too high up,
too remote, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, they, a lot of them
will never, ever have been topped before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we've seen that given the
intersex traits being a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue for some people, uh, if you have the
ability to not stress them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: then, you know, don't stress them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but at the same time, you know,
we, we're, we're saying that in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: err on the side of caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my personal experience has been
incredibly resistant, hardy, vigorous,
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerant plants that basically take
whatever you throw at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find it funny to contrast that with
the image that a lot of people have as
[SPEAKER_00]: these really finicky and difficult to grow
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no, not at all the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're difficult to make them stop
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're, you're trying to,
you're trying to manage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's, that's a whole
different, new different set of problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of that is from people
trying to bring in stuff that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: acclimated to Thailand, outdoors,
to indoors, and they just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're trying to feed it,
you know, GH nutrients, like just stuffing
[SPEAKER_02]: it full of nutrients and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not what a lot of these land
races want.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't, they don't respond well to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it'll make them finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think one place where the
cannabis industry is really far behind in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to, um, in regards to the wine
industry or other, or teeth is in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding soil compositions and
minerals, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, you know, clearly fertile loamy
soil, lots of water that is strong
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what we're seeking to
necessarily do, especially with plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that have such a long flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to reduce the overall cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the wine industry, for example,
we apply such techniques as partial root
[SPEAKER_00]: dehydration, um, which would be,
which will serve to stress the plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: very tactical ways in order to induce,
um, specific physiological changes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see in the plant's phytochemical
makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in the makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so as far as that goes with these
land races, you'll find that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in sort of like beautiful,
pristine soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like we're talking about
like in Cambodia, a lot of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to be maybe a bit sad to
hear these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the grows are no longer next to the
Mekong on sort of front lane areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're in freshly deforested
rainforest, which is often being
[SPEAKER_00]: deforested for timber or sometimes
specifically for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so in that regards, the jungle
soils are often very, very poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in Parbati Valley, we see totally
degraded soils, um, from overuse of urea,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, very, very, very acidic soils,
um, on the bottom of slopes where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's sort of draining down and
accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are still thriving,
um, relatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've got different criteria here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing 25 acres, um,
on a hillside, it doesn't really matter if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have one or two plants that are a
little bit raggedy looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, especially, no one's ever going to see
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get rubbed in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit of a different
concerns in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, the way we treat plants in the U
S compared to these big massive fields is
[SPEAKER_02]: night and day different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cute, you know, taking care of your
babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people that are worried about
intersex traits and stuff, just remember
[SPEAKER_02]: like anything, if you're watching this,
anything intersects like any other trait
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis, whether it's purple,
whether it's a scent, it can be bred out
[SPEAKER_02]: or bred in, you know, I mean, this is
something that can be selected for or
[SPEAKER_02]: selected to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I'm a little scared of things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's very easy to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd like to offer some perspective
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one, the land races are going through
our patterns of cultivation, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: including periods of time where many males
are being culled before reverting to total
[SPEAKER_00]: open pollination for a few decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, um, that that'll be enough to
bring out intersex traits in your
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if you're talking about,
you know, a hypothetical land race,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been growing on a hillside,
or maybe that's by example, on a flood
[SPEAKER_00]: plain, um, for a long time, there will be
maybe a little portion of the field that's
[SPEAKER_00]: raised above the water, the water level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, every, again,
this is totally hypothetical scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making sure every, you know,
maybe 60 years, you've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: catastrophic floods and once every cycle
of floods, they happen to kill all the
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant or the population did not
have the intersex traits within it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that population would just disappear,
um, with the flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a survival mechanism that's
found in large cannabis populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just goes hand in hand with land
races, but especially with land races that
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone through periods of intense
cultivation, um, or which are being grown
[SPEAKER_00]: according to the modern sort of breeding
practices of separating males.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some good context to add to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there any other strains you want to
talk about or get into, um, before we wrap
[SPEAKER_02]: it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause I want, I want to be able to
point people to some specific stuff they
[SPEAKER_02]: could check out on your site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something other than what we've
mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we talked about the sort of the
easier to approach ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which again, I don't think that
there's, you know, maybe necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge difference in the, in the skill curve
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I will say that Kronkrabia,
um, Kronkrabia is the reputed to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the most potent, the strongest
of all the land races grown in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in territorial Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, it's a wonderful,
it's a wonderful kind of succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we see phenotypes that are really,
really resonance with sort of fermented,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky, sweet lemon character,
which I'm very personally fond of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of my experiences with,
um, cannabis from Amsterdam in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties with amnesia hazes, which have
this sort of insensi, insensi kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the pestron Krabia expresses itself
along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's very, very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it grows with a pretty unique,
uh, bud structure, which I think will take
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of you by surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's my, if you look at it,
if you look at it from far away,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like a totally normal cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it close up, it looks a
little bit more like a mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the bud structure very loose and
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows for the UVs to penetrate,
you know, inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it, it's, it's rare to find
sedative narcotic cannabis due in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southeast Asia, due to the long growing
period where the trichomes are taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time to ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that on the Kronkrabia there's,
there's, you know, such penetration all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're seeing quite a high amount of
photo oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you cut it at the right time,
it's got this clear, bright, racy cerebral
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you let it go all the way,
which can be as long as 28 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll definitely see a lot of really dark
colored trichomes and a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics additive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally, I've really enjoyed both
expressions of the, of the Kronkrabia in
[SPEAKER_00]: that regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise the Thai mango is like,
you know, everybody loves mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a delicious fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, the, the mango
expression, the expressions in Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, whether that's, you know, Mysuru or
Thai or Cambodian mango or whatever else,
[SPEAKER_00]: they range from the sort of the green
mentholated camphor mango through to the
[SPEAKER_00]: more ripe, red, juicy mangoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people prize different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, um, if it's called Mamuan,
which is mango in Thai, it's going more
[SPEAKER_00]: for the ripe mango spectrum as the green
mango is something that's more commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: found across the board in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen a lot, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the red mango that's sort of
really valued and prized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as that goes, the lowland areas
where mango traditionally was grown and
[SPEAKER_00]: selected are pretty much overrun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are accessions in the north of
the country around Chiang Mai,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with some smaller growers doing open
pollinations and in the sticks,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, then you'll be like 80 to a hundred,
150 kilometers outside the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them, one of the groups is Mong
group in Doi in Canon, the tallest
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain in Chiang Mai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only is it one of the most
stunningly beautiful places that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just, if you could picture yourself
smoking weed from that place in that
[SPEAKER_00]: place, it's really just heaven on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the Thai mango from this,
uh, terroir, um, due to the altitude and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold temperatures, which is not that
cold in Thailand, but a few thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: meters, thousand feet gets a bit nippy
comes across really purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, we used to back in the day,
sell that as the, the Thai purple mango
[SPEAKER_00]: and selling out like that every single
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually just took the purple out of
the name because we wanted people to try
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, you, you probably should
check out the Thai mango if, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's your thing, if you like purple
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise we made some selections from
individual black plants in Barbati Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: namely in Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also in Tosh, I think Tosh is really
the two to look out for the Soran and Goy
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're really high altitude fields
above the Tosh Kutla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there we, we saw maybe like
one plant in 10 showing any coloration,
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant, a hundred showing significant,
and then one in a thousand being like pure
[SPEAKER_00]: black or dark maroon, red kind of purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those plants we made selections
from and we separated those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking to Fino hunt,
um, you know, those are going to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you a slightly better chance than the
general population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is, which, which one
specifically is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, maybe I'll just explain to you
how we split up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the general populations,
which are from, you know, we've asked the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to basically mix all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what they do by standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run plants all the fields and they
sit in their house and a little pile of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed accumulates below them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked them just to sort through it,
to clean it out, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actions is either us or like members
of our team or the farmers making
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a village selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that that's just when we've gone
there for two, three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, um, we're going and looking
for all the best plants that we can,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, putting the side of the seeds aside
for those apart from the general
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the single plant
selections, which you'll see, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the, we need to figure out an
English word for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it should be,
man, but in French it's like the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plots is such a clumsy word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very romantic, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to come up with a word for that,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the plot selections are obviously
selections made from individual plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, as I said before,
we're encouraging the farmers to rub from
[SPEAKER_00]: individual fields and to tell their
customers the name of the fields that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're rubbing from as a way to increase
the value of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we're making selections from
those two and then the individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for example, it'll be like,
um, the torch good luck, the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: village and the name of the, of the,
of the garden and then the black
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's your, your single plant
selection from, from the guy garden in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome to make all of them
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people actually have a choice,
you know, of where they will take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, well, well, well, well, well,
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about this real quick,
because I didn't even know this was a
[SPEAKER_02]: thing and I'm going to join myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and bought seeds from you before we
ever spoke because I was so stoked about
[SPEAKER_02]: this and like the purchases from the site
go to the farmers, which is super
[SPEAKER_02]: important to me and, and noble as can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I commend you for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the Patreon thing I want to join.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, well, basically the,
we talked a lot about incentivizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, the way to do that is to,
you know, as we said, to sell their seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and to get them paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, given that a lot of
what we do is touching on social issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that, you know, deal a lot heavily
with the class, with race, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: colonialism, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and given that there was a need for,
for me as a foreigner and for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: other foreigners to do administrative
slash communication roles, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: we felt that it wasn't right to,
you know, take a, take a cut out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead what we set up was,
um, a Patreon program and a subscription
[SPEAKER_00]: program on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, during the course of our
work, um, we, you know, myself personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm traveling, I'll, you know,
for example, if I'm accessing the general
[SPEAKER_00]: population, I'm going to go, go see some,
go see the village and go pick up a
[SPEAKER_00]: restock on, on the general pop few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be like, maybe along the
way, some uncle who's like, yo,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a few seeds here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff that we can't, it's not,
we, because we are not in the business of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing reproductions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we don't get seeds from the hill
tribes or whatever, and then grow them out
[SPEAKER_00]: in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, it's direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we almost, you know, I mean,
I, I have my own grow, um, but I have so
[SPEAKER_00]: many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're like, okay, so we're going to get
these seeds, these small quantities,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rarest stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be for, for the nerds,
you know, for the people who are really
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate and who want basically,
you know, hand selected, um, seeds from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from people who are currently and actively
sourcing in the traditional growing
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, you know, hand selected point of
origin seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that allows us to draw an income,
which allows us to do the recruiting work
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring new, you know, groups or
communities into the collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it's, it's working with a lot
of synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, maybe we're not the best at
keeping all the social media up to date,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is probably why a lot of you guys
might not have heard of us until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we definitely, you know,
we, we hold it down with the seeds and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I feel like everybody involved
is satisfied with the amount of genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're, that they're getting from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're doing our best to stand by
our people, you know, ultimately doing
[SPEAKER_00]: solid by the traditional indigenous land
race community, uh, growing communities in
[SPEAKER_00]: some ways, um, takes bread out of people's
mouth in the West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we, you know, we want to be
sort of as, as, as honest and as helpful,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, with people in the West, you know,
to give them, you know, as much of a room
[SPEAKER_00]: at the table as, as we can, you know,
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see this as, as a, a way to form new
connections and new bridges between the
[SPEAKER_00]: communities in different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're so disconnected right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and with integration, I think we would
all benefit, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what this is all about in
the end for, for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's why we started the syndicate and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, you guys are doing your
thing on the other side and hopefully,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we were talking even more
recently about, um, the strain database
[SPEAKER_02]: we're building and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully even we can continue to
collaborate and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've asked you to help with the,
uh, land race portion of our strain
[SPEAKER_02]: database that we're building that I'm
really super stoked about that something
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, there's all kinds of fun
collaborations that we can do and reach
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it to some people seems like pie
in the sky stuff, but I think we can
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplish a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for, for a little bit of time to
come out of the shadows a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, particular countries like
Indonesia, the rich tradition of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: are very, very, very oppressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not for lack of want,
you know, we, we, you know, people have
[SPEAKER_00]: always wanted to perform these legs and
collaborate, but now the time feels right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and so if, if we can,
you know, help some, someone make a name
[SPEAKER_00]: for themselves by breeding the next
cannabis cup winner, um, from Fino
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting, some land race gene pool,
the excess through us, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would make us happier than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really, we want to lift people up on
everywhere we can.
Yeah.
