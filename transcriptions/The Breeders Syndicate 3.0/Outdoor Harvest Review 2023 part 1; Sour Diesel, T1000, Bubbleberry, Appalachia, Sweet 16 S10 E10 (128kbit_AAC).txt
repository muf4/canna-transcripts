[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be on this show this
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of are trying to experiment a
little bit with other people running it
[SPEAKER_01]: for when I'm down or I have to get other
stuff done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's always been kind of the
goal, and thousands help to plunge with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this week, it's going to be run by
Thousand and Kush of the Giants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also going to have, well,
Kush of the Giants, Little Hill,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Peach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be talking about like
the outbrow results, strain-specific type
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, what does well outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't like outdoor stuff,
but I'm pretty impressed with how well
[SPEAKER_01]: they did, real proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm stoked to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, we'll kick it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't want to just crash into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So see you in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the
Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, I will be your host,
Thousandfold, and we are without Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some context, he's having a little bit
of tooth trouble, but also we were
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually hoping that Kush could actually
host this himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're sort of on the way to that,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am here for tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to let Kush run the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are joined tonight by Little Hill,
Peaches, Kush of the Giants, all crew
[SPEAKER_02]: members that some of you would have met
before on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, without further ado,
I'll hand it over to Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first of all, I wanted to thank
Little Hill and Peaches for tagging along
[SPEAKER_04]: and doing this conversation with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially tonight, we're just going
to do a small outdoor recap of the season
[SPEAKER_04]: that we had for outdoor last year,
the cleanup and the prep that we have for
[SPEAKER_04]: next season.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be talking about what
strains we liked last fall and what worked
[SPEAKER_04]: well, what didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to wrap it all up by
talking about what we're excited to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: for this upcoming season.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be a super long episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be short and sweet and just
kind of recap the season and have a
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion about everything that we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so we'll start it off with just
what did you grow this last outdoor season
[SPEAKER_04]: that really worked well with you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What were the ones that stood out to you
and in your mind, what was your favorite?
[SPEAKER_04]: For me personally, the highlight of last
year's outdoor grow were the Sweet 16
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids that CSI sent my way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played with them and I follow my
nose a lot when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially for selecting stuff that I
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: My nose is usually one of my main things
that I aim after.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of these Sweet 16 hybrids were
just incredibly strong, pungent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just at a party a couple of weekends
ago and I brought some of the Sweet 16
[SPEAKER_04]: pineapple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I cracked the jar,
there are people across the room would go,
[SPEAKER_04]: geez, man, what is in that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just the floral notes that come
off of it stand out to me out of a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the stuff that I grew from this last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to see its expression across
multiple hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried Sweet 16 to pineapple,
Sweet 16 to Humble Dupper Cut,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I tried four different Sweet 16 to Kim
D's.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all expressed that wine
fermenting fruit, just really strong odor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time you crack a jar, it hits you
like something that's almost offensive to
[SPEAKER_04]: the nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so strong in its odor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, this year for me, the Sweet 16
hybrids, I wasn't expecting much out of
[SPEAKER_04]: them, but man, they blew my socks off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super happy that I got to try those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to needle you a bit about
this, because you're talking about how are
[SPEAKER_02]: the effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you implying that the effects,
they're not quite as strong as some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Sweet 16 pineapple was,
Sativa Liner, wasn't as strong as the
[SPEAKER_04]: other two hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I'm talking about pungent,
I'm talking about the smell, specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: on the nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all great smoke, the Sativa
Liner not being as heavy, but they were
[SPEAKER_04]: all very potent, very resinous strains,
completely covered in resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was impressed with what I saw through
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sweet 16 that he used has a strong
genetic backbone, because you could see
[SPEAKER_04]: the similarities across the multiple
cultivars he crossed it to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, one of the other big ones this
year that I really enjoyed from CSI was
[SPEAKER_04]: the Triangle Kush Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another one of his Girl Scout Cookie
hybrids that I grew that kind of just
[SPEAKER_04]: grows itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to baby it, and it just
really flourishes in my environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes out almost perfect to what I
prefer smoking out of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: is just a really good pain relief.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has great citrus, great cushy smells,
and it looks really good in the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again, continually, this is the
fourth year in a row that I've tried a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of different Girl Scout Cookie
hybrids from CSI's library, and they all
[SPEAKER_04]: continually provide this really great
smoke for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got some more that I want to talk
about from last year, but I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: ahead and ask Little Hill, what were some
of the standouts from your garden last
[SPEAKER_04]: year?
[SPEAKER_04]: What were some things that really stood
out to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew a lot of new stuff this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a little extra space to work with,
and I wanted to figure out what was going
[SPEAKER_03]: to work for me outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been grown strictly outdoors in quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably been, I don't know,
six years or so, or seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with new strains and what's popular,
I am a commercial guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to figure out what was going to
work in my environment, finish,
[SPEAKER_03]: and do well for my grow style,
which is pretty hands-off organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The standouts that I'm going to run again
next year were mochi runts, and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know who that strain came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a clone from a commercial nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a runce plant, but much more
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really high testing in THC, and the candy
flavor came through, and the color came
[SPEAKER_03]: through, and really a vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little hesitant to run anything
runts because I generally don't like it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that one definitely won me over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one was papaya bomb, which is a
papaya to THC bomb cross, also from a
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge flowers, and just an old late-1990s
early 2000s type of smell of just strong
[SPEAKER_03]: tropical fruit, hence its name papaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see a whole lot like that
anymore, and it really takes me back to
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet tooth number three and some of the
stuff I grew when I first started growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was really happy with that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny you should mention those sweet 16
crosses, and this little side garden I had
[SPEAKER_03]: where I grew a bunch of seed and some
random clones I acquired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did grow the sweet 16 clone,
and I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for commercial production,
but as far as flavor and having something
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy the smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not super potent, but it's a fun
plant, and I still held onto the clone
[SPEAKER_03]: just to figure it out if I might do
something with it in the future or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, but I really did enjoy that
clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the guys that Caleb got those
genetics from.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them's a very good friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one's a good friend,
but he's since moved away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I knew the precursors to those
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which clone are we talking about right
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Mendo perks to a killer queen
cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those guys are Mendo guys that I knew
pretty well that we were all doing it back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Green Rush heydays.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of cool to see that those
genetics still sort of mixed up and
[SPEAKER_03]: thriving because they are unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really a time when you could
grow stuff that just like the smell jumped
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the bag unlike now where it really
seems like smell inflated flavors have all
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of gotten bland and the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a fun one to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my biggest reason for liking that
strain was the uniqueness of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried the sweet 16 from Caleb and the
first time he cracked the jar and I put my
[SPEAKER_04]: nose in there, I was like, I've never
smelled anything like this in cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: before, the fermenting wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: The blackberry wine 69.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this was at the party.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he also had the blackberry wine,
the 69.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of them were like, these are
unique turf profiles that I've never
[SPEAKER_04]: smelled in a plant before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then those same turps seeing them in
the three different hybrids that I got to
[SPEAKER_04]: try last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh yeah, there's shades of it
here, but just little influences from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Kim D or little influences from the
Humboldt uppercut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really shone through and basically
covered everything in frost and gave it a
[SPEAKER_04]: good nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine the cross to pineapple was
great for the nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pineapple was another cut sort of from
that same era that all these same people
[SPEAKER_03]: were growing in some form or fashion
because it's the nose jumped out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really what sold pot for us
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, that clone, the pineapple
clone was always a farm favorite for
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the stinkiest one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sweet 16 pineapple,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cracked that and it's like rotten
pineapples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are looking at me like,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also grew a clone in my little side
garden from Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave his brother a bunch of selections
from Girl Scout Cookies, Runtz T1000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I looked at some of the plants he
had flowered out and I picked the one I
[SPEAKER_03]: liked the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grew those out and, you know,
just kind of like, it's kind of like what
[SPEAKER_03]: the market seems to want or what they
think they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like purple, frosty weed,
dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really my- I've been wanting to ask
you one thing little hell like on the
[SPEAKER_02]: T1000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you see it as a kind of cookies
alternate or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I see it more as an Urkel alternate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it is an Urkel leaning
phenotype of the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's got some of it's like heavily
like favors the Urkel flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a little squat compared to some
of the other phenotypes you get out of
[SPEAKER_03]: that crop cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just it just got added potency,
added added vigor from a triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, so what else did I grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dog Waltz S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had those from some really old seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was I only got three to pop out of 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was really, really old seed 15
years old, give or take.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of them was pretty bland.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two had that smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was green.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one was pretty purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny to see that variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept cuts of both of the ones I liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I grow this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I grew Sour Easily for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say before you go into the
sour, I just want to add that I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: if I'm allowed to leak this, but there may
be that that the pool nuts cut has been
[SPEAKER_02]: found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I can say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to note that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just in case it hasn't been I don't
think we've gotten it yet from the person
[SPEAKER_03]: who said they had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, though, it's supposed to be on the
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody gets busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will we'll see if it actually if we
can actually get our hands on it and if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's actually the real one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love I it's my favorite weed all
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm I'm really looking forward to
getting my hands back on it and
[SPEAKER_03]: introducing it to sort of this modern
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's a stinker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a great high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's just my favorite weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, those S ones were fun,
fun to smoke again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny how and I think this is this is
a good segue into sour diesels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew sour diesel for the first time in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grew a lot of it back in the day
because there was there's strong still is
[SPEAKER_03]: strong demand for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's funny how like your memory things
are always better in your memory than than
[SPEAKER_03]: than what they what they really were.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like that's going on right now
with sour diesel where whether you have
[SPEAKER_03]: the the real cut or not, I feel like
there's a lot of cuts that are so similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tough to tell apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sour diesel I grew is exactly what I
remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so there's that but the the purple Kim
dog or the dog waltz, sometimes I call it
[SPEAKER_03]: purple Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: The poodle nuts, it's got a lot of names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like I was smelling these these two
Finos I got and I was like, man,
[SPEAKER_03]: is this it it's not as gassy as I remember
the grapes there but is the gas there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is the flavor there doesn't
really burn my nostrils and I remember it
[SPEAKER_03]: burning my nostrils or is this just in my
head that it'll never be as good as my
[SPEAKER_03]: memories of it just because I've I've
built up this these thoughts in my head
[SPEAKER_03]: about how great it was because it's my
favorite read of all time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a little bit of that of that's
going on with sour diesel and everybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: saying like, this isn't the same one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as this it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, well, you know, a lot of
people don't want to admit that maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: you're holding it on a pedestal in your
mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's never gonna it's you're never
going to be able to find the right one or
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it to what you thought it was in your
mind.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then exactly and then add on like
everybody's growing under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, everything's different about how we
grow and and and co2 and so it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not being grown in these like,
I mean, grow rooms in 2005 were were so
[SPEAKER_03]: like Stone Age compared to where they're
at now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, with high pressure sodium
and carbon filters and most people weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: running co2 and and and and who knows what
temperature and humidity fluctuations
[SPEAKER_03]: you're having at night and you know,
nobody was as dialed in as they are now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't I don't know, like all those
little things affect the plant so
[SPEAKER_03]: dramatically on how it expresses itself,
especially sour diesel, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, just just my thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's yeah, that's that's that's about
that's about where I'm at with with what I
[SPEAKER_03]: like from last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny you mentioned that with sour D
because I think it it also kind of lends
[SPEAKER_04]: credence into volatile turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew a Kim 91 S1 and a snitch free sour
D last year that both exhibited the
[SPEAKER_04]: volatile Kim strong traits that you get on
the nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the resin after harvest and after
sitting in their jars, they they morphed
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that that, you know, that sour diesel
that I'm used to smelling or that that
[SPEAKER_04]: chem dog that I'm used to smelling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you said, it changes or my perception
of it has changed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's not it's not exactly what I
thought it was every now that I've I've
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten a chance to throw it in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, it's everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're you're curing process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're I mean, yeah, it's it is a finicky
plant and those things are volatile and
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also a lot of us were probably growing
at smaller scale 20 years ago or 15 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago than we are now or or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like all those things just make a
difference regardless of whether you think
[SPEAKER_03]: they are or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's every little thing is different now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peaches, you you and Buck also have a
sour, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not a bad segue for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did four of them outside this
year just in 10 gallon pots on the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hill because all the big pots were
filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she did really good outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a heavy feeder, definite heavy
feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could give her as much in her 10 gallon
as the forty fives were getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kept her happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but she did good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it was it's one of my
favorite smokes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it finally got dried and cured,
it tasted just like it used to taste back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember getting it from up in the
bay in like 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the first weed I ever
tried to actually tasted good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it it coated your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never forgot that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to smoke it again, it's it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Turks are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning on putting it back out next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few more of them a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so it was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went the sour went 11 weeks all the
way into November.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, she was smaller and no mold,
no nothing like she was a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got rained on and everything and no
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: She purpled up really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was a beautiful fall colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she she was always mold resistant at
my place.
[SPEAKER_03]: She could get rained on quite a bit and
hold up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, she got rained on, I want to say,
like three or four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, towards the end,
letting her finish up, she was getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: dew in the mornings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a little worried, but nothing,
no powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: No botrytis, just a real champ of a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, big flowers, but flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really a loud airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I squashed some of the flower
just recently into flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't got to smoke it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, was it it was so turpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't come off the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so oily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those types that,
you know, just so gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gassy smelling and stuff that it just that
that rosin is not going to set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: How was the yield on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly, I haven't weighed it yet to
see what it yielded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally pressed it on the last day and
threw it in the freezer and came home with
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it's still in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was it always did really well for
for yield and quality on the bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was this was before rosin was even a
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was always the first stuff we
washed and it was the main stuff we wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: for bubble hash because it it just
quantity and quality was always top notch
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, see, you should have never told me
that because now I'm going to put more out
[SPEAKER_00]: on the hill next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you got the climate for them to
finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really do like that post Halloween
finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you got that climate,
I say go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we do sometimes we don't,
you know, it just it all depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year was a good year, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rained a little bit, but nothing major.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't too bad because we don't have
a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's just out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to stand up to what Mother
Nature brings to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than the sourdee, what else in the
garden did you grow last year that really
[SPEAKER_04]: stood out to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Barbara Bud by House of the Great
Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been searching for peach chirps now
for like five years and it's the first one
[SPEAKER_00]: that had peach chirps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several different phenos had it in it,
but there was one that she had it from
[SPEAKER_00]: start to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just made flower rosin with her
and it tastes like peaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh, like artificial or like candy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like a peach cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the little peach cup she
used to get as a kid.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like sweet peach smelling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never encountered that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time I've ever smelled
peach in a string like and then I I only
[SPEAKER_00]: had one phenol I kept because she smelled
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones kind of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I saved the two that changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did fresh frozen with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I washed them and squashed them,
that live rosin, when you stir it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it smells like peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't even the phenol I kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, she's she's got those chirps in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did great in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: No mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I had I only had five feminized seeds
that I had put out and every one was a
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those phenol phenols didn't
grow past two feet tall, was a mad bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she reminded me of how Bubba used to
grow or like the banana Kush or Ella
[SPEAKER_00]: confidential, just not tall, totally all
leaf, horrible to prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenol I would never keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was another one that was a
sativa phenol that got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine feet tall, had open buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I washed along with another one
that was similar to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my keeper phenol had the nice,
thick, dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had good coverage, sandy trichomes and
that peach smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do her again next year
because I was so impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have to say my one other
standout on the hill that I wasn't too
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with the turf profiles because I got
a lot of mandarin cookie leaning ones was
[SPEAKER_00]: the peach crescendo because she's got some
frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you go to trim her up and you're what
an eighth in and you've already got to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean your scissors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then a couple of times I've smoked
her in the last few days and I've caught a
[SPEAKER_00]: little hint of peach, like a fresh peach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it kind of changes almost into
like a banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it kind of changes from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and there's some potential in that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were probably the ones I was the
most happy with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I'm trimming and like you said,
your scissors get gunked up way too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mind always goes, oh, I wonder how this
would wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm always always thinking about
the concentrates on that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else I wanted to talk about
before I before I go on a couple other
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that I grew last year,
the papaya little hill that you grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see any pink pistols when you grew
it outdoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the original papaya did
that or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this cross none of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of the modern papaya people
are talking about the pink pistols in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see anything remotely close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the pink pistol stuff is either
camera OG lineage or there is some other
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff my buddy down in Hoplund used to
have some guava kush that he made that had
[SPEAKER_03]: some wild bud from Hawaii in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were phenotypes that would push
out those hot pink pistols.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's that's about it as far as
I've seen from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, both the Chem 91 and the Sweet 16
Chem 91 pushed pink pistols this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: They stayed pretty true to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was a Sweet 16 Chem 91 cross
or Chem D, not 91.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was Sweet 16 to Chem D,
not Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very chemically, very salty, but also
still like still mostly overpowered by
[SPEAKER_04]: that fermenting wine, fermenting fruit
smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else I wanted to talk about was
the Appalachia crosses from high and
[SPEAKER_04]: lonesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to try a plethora of them between my
garden and my two, my best friend and my
[SPEAKER_04]: brother's garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I popped a bunch of Appalachia stuff,
kept three or four for myself and gave
[SPEAKER_04]: them three or four each to grow out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I was really blown away with was
the Appalachia old Betsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was like a dead ringer for old
piney Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just cushy old genetics, bright green,
dense buds with fire red, orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like being transported back to the
early 2000s when I was first messing
[SPEAKER_04]: around with buying weed and before I
started growing in 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before that, I was picking up stuff
that reminded me of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really impressed with what the
Appalachia did outdoors across all the
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really big, really vigorous, really
healthy plants and that funky orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this mango funk that accommodates
all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was shown through mostly in the
Shoreline Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Shoreline Appalachia started off
smelling like just orange and vanilla or
[SPEAKER_04]: like those candied orange slices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after harvest and after it spent
some time in the jar, it's just skunky,
[SPEAKER_04]: volatile smells that are dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Acrid would be a great way to describe how
funky the skunk smell is coming out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Shoreline Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then another one that I was really
impressed by in the Appalachia line was
[SPEAKER_04]: the Appalachia to the Loompa's headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was some of the best lemon turps that
I've had in recent memories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the strongest lemon turps,
like Lemon Party still holds the crown for
[SPEAKER_04]: me for lemon turps, but it was just a
really good blend of cushy, full of salt,
[SPEAKER_04]: instant onset, heavy medication with a
nice lemon drop flavor in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really impressed with the Appalachia
Loompa's headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother got a chance to grow that one
and I didn't and I liked it so much that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm absolutely going to try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably going to try two or three
plants of it next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what else did I grow last year
that I really like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the ATW hybrids, the Arcata
trainwreck hybrids from PAC, some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: most unique takes I've ever smelled on
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to grow a cat five and a mojo ryzen.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother grew a cat five and a mojo
ryzen and then my best friend grew a mojo
[SPEAKER_04]: five and a cat ryzen.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the crosses for us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are dosy dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: The category five is dosy dose slurricane
to Arcata trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the mojo ryzen is blue garlic to
Arcata trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the category fives were like mixed
berry on top of turpentine, kind of like a
[SPEAKER_04]: mixed berry crunch and still dominated by
the tealing, but hints of berry mixed in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the mojo ryzen were super unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely turpentine, but more of a
menthol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called it blueberry menthol.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I would rub the stalk or the stems,
I'd get like a blueberry menthol
[SPEAKER_04]: turpentine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's also this background layer of
mushroom compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smelled it in the blue garlics at the
party.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first smelled it, I was like,
whoa, it's like composting mushroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as I grew the mojo ryzens,
that blue garlic mushroom funk came
[SPEAKER_04]: through and it was very prevalent across
all three plants in three different
[SPEAKER_04]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know what's in the blue garlic?
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the blue garlic is...
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure about the top of my head,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's... I think it's GMO to the
blue cookies, but I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, yeah, I think it's blue
cookies to GMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it up really quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can come back to it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it up when we get chats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm chatting about something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the stuff from Pac, from Goat
Farm, I really liked those ATW hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made me want to do the blue dream ATW,
knowing what's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running those now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you... Yeah, I'm already
seeing... They're not far.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably about 20 days in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the balance of turpentine and
blueberry is already quite apparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously it's going to change
over the flowering period, but already I
[SPEAKER_02]: can see the different balances that each
individual is showing me, which is really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be honest, this whole time,
I know that the Syndicate crew generally
[SPEAKER_02]: are big fans of turpentine, but this is
maybe the first time I've actually
[SPEAKER_02]: confirmed myself what turpentine actually
is, because it's so obvious with these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm like, okay, I know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what that is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet those have a potential to be huge
yielders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trainwreck crosses do great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trainwreck is good in itself, but it needs
a boost from something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually a squad indica, but a blue dream
is also a commercial yielder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have potential for having really,
really good weight on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vigor on these was alarming.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, as someone who grows in these
basically micro spaces, this has been
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the most challenging line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue dream is a real narrow leaf,
and it's going to stretch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trainwreck is this weird mix of equatorial
genetics and indica genetics, where it
[SPEAKER_03]: also has a stretch, but it has a very odd
leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might look like an indica or pretend to
be one for a while, and then it hits its
[SPEAKER_03]: stride and starts stretching.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say the stems on
trainwreck will stretch a lot and they
[SPEAKER_03]: won't break.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very rubbery.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll bend all the way over back onto
the ground and not break.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say that I can definitely at least
anecdotally corroborate what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trainwreck leaners are giving me
trouble because they want to splay out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to flop over and take over
all the horizontal space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the blue dream leaners just want to
go straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having to do very different
constraints for both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I would expect.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: those late season trainwreck plants,
tying them up and they're just all floppy
[SPEAKER_04]: all over the place no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weight on those thin branches is
insane for trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I think it gets its name
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't support it properly,
it's just this whole maze of branches just
[SPEAKER_03]: flopped over laying on the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's where it gets its name,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it in my own garden of plants
just completely falling over and pulling
[SPEAKER_03]: bamboo stakes out of the ground,
falling towards the south where the weight
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just take those bamboo stakes,
pull them back and the whole plant just
[SPEAKER_03]: pops right back up and not a single broken
branch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask Little Hill about his
Phoenix stuff and how he thought it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a T1000 adjacent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phoenix is a T1000 back to triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a triangle back cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I selected this for four years ago,
I think, or five seasons ago, 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had it on the back burner just
growing it a little bit here and there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I really rolled out with it this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew the quality was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew I liked the smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was going to do okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, added bonus, it yielded really,
really well in the outdoor beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely going to roll out with it
again next year and grow more of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I passed it to a few other people,
including CSI's brother in Trinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been good enough to stick in their
gardens and take up some real estate in
[SPEAKER_03]: their gardens as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been absolutely so happy with it as
far as just the quality of the smoke and
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavor I wanted to get, as well as the
potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've gotten three test results
back and they've all been through the
[SPEAKER_03]: roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: High terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was over 3% terpenes,
which is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then just the added bonus was the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't expect it to do quite as well as
it did, but it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a commercial cultivator, but I
selected this based off of vigor,
[SPEAKER_03]: not yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had all the properties I wanted as far
as flavor and structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vigor was a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow it big enough population,
I grew 111 females out to pick this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was unique out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really see a difference in vigor
from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All seed has its vigor for the most part,
but there's these sports that stand out
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can't hold them back from
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They outgrow their sisters.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in that group of maybe the top
10% vigorous plants, which was just also
[SPEAKER_03]: an added bonus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm selecting for quality of flower for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to have it be in that top 10%,
I think that's really what makes a
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial viable cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream is in that same category.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't hold it back from growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of what makes it such a good
commercial cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to have that added bonus,
it's going to be a quarter of my outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: garden next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably grow it in some greenhouses
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phoenix is an awesome name for a back
cross train like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I called it because it survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the only mother I kept through the
fire in 2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needed a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were calling it Back to the Triangle
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just felt like Phoenix was what we
should call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cross should be called Back to the
Triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Caleb ever named it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a good name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a giggle out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to the Triangle, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's got to get used.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'd like to thank Chris the Giants,
Little Hill, and Peaches for showing up
[SPEAKER_01]: and hanging out, and Thousand for running
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget, we have the new sub-rob drop
coming out with some Skunk Dog S1 Cross to
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour Dub, as well as the 98 Super Silver
Haze Cut that people call the Cuff Winning
[SPEAKER_01]: Shanti Cut, which we don't really know,
but we know it's a great cut of Super
[SPEAKER_01]: Silver Haze Cross to Sour Dub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fems, that's going to be on the Riot site.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing another drop of
Blue Dream soon with Goat Farm brand new
[SPEAKER_01]: releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done yet with it or shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just haven't shown them, and they've
been run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, keep your ears and eyes peeled for
the TGA work, because as odd as it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear me announcing the new TGA stuff,
it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space Dude met a lot of other things that
he probably should have met back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, in my opinion and other people's
opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's conflicting because it's TGA,
but we love Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always loved Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm really stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Sub had a legacy with some cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made his name doing cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of how our relationship was,
I think that no matter what, I can put my
[SPEAKER_01]: biases aside with that to make sure that
legacy survives with extra bullshit still
[SPEAKER_01]: around with something he brought to the
table really well in selecting the Space
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, we have Seeds at Gert by
Seeds in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Riot Seed Co Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Lifted Seeds in the US who can
also take card directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon, maybe, maybe, maybe South America
and Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how it pans out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going well, so if it does,
I'll definitely keep you guys posted in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'll probably see you guys in a
few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until then, stay nice to each other as
nice as you can be, or only be mean to the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones who deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
