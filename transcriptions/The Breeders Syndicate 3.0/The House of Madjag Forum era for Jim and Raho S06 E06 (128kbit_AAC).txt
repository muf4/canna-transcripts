[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it was like I was connected
with everything around me All of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started questioning everything I'd
ever been told You know by the time I got
[SPEAKER_01]: high that very first time When it started
to hit me
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we wanted to start an
episode talking about the forum era
[SPEAKER_05]: because I was a part of the forum era But
you guys were a part of different forums
[SPEAKER_05]: than I was on so you had a lot of
interactions with different characters and
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of them are You know kind of
legendary dudes and and you've had
[SPEAKER_05]: interactions with guys that are really
really good archivists that I Have not had
[SPEAKER_05]: the pleasure of interacting with so I
wanted you both to kind of talk about your
[SPEAKER_05]: introduction to the forums I mean,
it's gonna be two different stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Rahul you want to start?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was your introduction to the forums?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know early 2000s I I discovered that
people had started using the internet for
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and I was shocked You can imagine
right I mean I'd I'd anyway I looked
[SPEAKER_01]: around I was doing a business trip out to
Amsterdam and and I I knew that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: the weed was so I figured I should try
this new tool and try and find stuff about
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shops and stuff and and You know
that was basically it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was scared to be on any site that talked
about weed back then You know the early
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000s were timed before proxy Servers were
out there and so, you know Having having
[SPEAKER_01]: anonymity of any kind on the web was
really a pretty fuzzy idea for for most
[SPEAKER_01]: people and you know a lot of people just
went up there boldly, you know with a you
[SPEAKER_01]: know fake name and and and keeping their
fingers crossed that nobody's gonna put a
[SPEAKER_01]: sniffer on the line and start tracking
traffic and grabbing IPS but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really wouldn't be it was you know,
just painfully simple for for tech people
[SPEAKER_01]: to to Really get some useful information
back then if they wanted to You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally got over my fear and said,
you know screw it I'm going up there and
[SPEAKER_01]: and my my landing Spot of choice was mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been I've been kind of looking at
different forums out there for You know
[SPEAKER_01]: the community how people treated each
other the knowledge level, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: figured it out real quick that A lot of
these places were organized around
[SPEAKER_01]: specific companies so that they were you
know, they were just the marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: Communication site for their customers and
the company themselves and but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was bias in every one of these
places and sure Mr. Nice had a great,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know had a great story about You know,
this is straight the original stuff from
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville, you know in a world of imitators
We got the original stuff and we're the
[SPEAKER_01]: only place that still Makes it the way
they they always were you know co-signed
[SPEAKER_01]: by Howard Marks to Howard Marks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you know who had nothing to do
with Neville, you know back doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff But but you know, I mean super cool
guy and you know our IP we we all miss him
[SPEAKER_01]: but um, yeah, I mean, you know,
it was the best story out there and and
[SPEAKER_01]: What I didn't realize is that there were
like wars going on between these between
[SPEAKER_01]: these different forums for the different
companies, you know since Mr. Nice had had
[SPEAKER_01]: people who were going on like rate what
appeared to be like rating parties to
[SPEAKER_01]: other people's Forums going and posting a
bunch of troll noise and stirring up
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble and running away You know,
it was the equivalent of of you know kids
[SPEAKER_01]: at a school dance You know afraid to go
talk to the girls on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know They were all defending their
their legends, you know their myths that
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know the story behind the the
foundation story Between our seed lines is
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler and and older than the found
foundation story for your old seed lines
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's really nothing's
changed, you know in 20 years with that
[SPEAKER_01]: regard You know that stories sell pictures
sell, you know, it's just now Before all
[SPEAKER_01]: we had to worry about was the story being
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now these days, I mean the pictures
are Geez, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they don't even need a plant to
start with by the time they start
[SPEAKER_01]: Photoshopping everything up like that
Yeah, I mean with AI that's actually a
[SPEAKER_05]: thing now like the AI can develop cannabis
plants So all these guys like they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: really even have to put any effort into
testing really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you need a new picture here AI,
but uh done Yeah, you know, so I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice was a great place But you know,
they these it's volatile up there You're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with people who are you know
taking a chance with their safety and and
[SPEAKER_01]: You know their livelihoods and by posting
up there on the on the internet trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a connection with somebody else who
you know who's into the same stuff they
[SPEAKER_01]: are and it's You know, sometimes people
get really stressed out They they they
[SPEAKER_01]: start worrying and getting paranoid about
their security up there and you see people
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of flip out and run away You
know it happens It happens even today Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you know But um, yeah, mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that most most old timers were up
on overgrow and Cannabis world and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these other forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I came in right when overgrow was about
to get rated So I was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I started sniffing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hey, maybe this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is the time Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost signed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have even created a profile just
before Just before they got rated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not yeah Yeah, so you came you came in
about the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did then right around 2006 2007 era
Yeah, as far as reading, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah online reading stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: No nothing just pure pure What do you call
it stalking or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah lurking lurking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a big-time lurker.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the man cyber creep is what we call
What what Raja was saying I also I did not
[SPEAKER_03]: know very much about computer technology
or how it was tracked and I always felt
[SPEAKER_03]: like it was a risk and so I was sort of
like scared to look at overgrow and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis world But I was also like a fly
to honey or something like I couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: resist so yeah I just tried to avoid like
trading or doing business on there or like
[SPEAKER_03]: telling too much about my personal life
because Like I remember like to speak of
[SPEAKER_03]: mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice or Howard Marks I remember reading
his autobiography and he said one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: worst things he ever did was set up like a
switchboard in Amsterdam that he thought
[SPEAKER_03]: was gonna be smooth to like Clear all his
calls through that just allowed the
[SPEAKER_03]: American government to listen to
everything else I was saying yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was like the worst decision I ever
made but I was trying to consolidate
[SPEAKER_03]: things and so I had no idea about IP ends
or VPNs or any of that stuff that Raja was
[SPEAKER_03]: Mentioning back then I was not computer
savvy in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had no idea if like a Interested
party could just pop up and see my address
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, but Overgrow and and cannabis world
were kind of different in the sense that I
[SPEAKER_03]: would say that like overgrow Had like a
wider range of participants So it had like
[SPEAKER_03]: way more like shit posting teenagers
yelling at you But then it also had like
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam skunk man and camera and like
different really heavy hitters at the time
[SPEAKER_03]: posting on the breeders, you know,
the breeders lab and and that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and you know Madjag you were you
know, you were showing off some of the the
[SPEAKER_03]: art that you know existed back then that
like growers would put on their their
[SPEAKER_03]: products and You know Sam was showing off
his collection You know one time of all
[SPEAKER_03]: the different art that he had collected of
the you know that localized and stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: so that I found fascinating Cannabis world
had a little bit more like adult discourse
[SPEAKER_03]: It was smaller and it was policed a little
bit better as far as not police like by
[SPEAKER_03]: cops but police by like members Yeah,
where they didn't allow quite as much
[SPEAKER_03]: rudeness and quite as much like,
you know throwing poo at one another And
[SPEAKER_03]: all that and you know, it was interesting
then too because it really documented well
[SPEAKER_03]: like the switch from Amsterdam to
Switzerland When Breeder Steve and Shanti
[SPEAKER_03]: and a bunch of those guys transferred From
Holland over to the big Swiss and that was
[SPEAKER_03]: in a lot of people's cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time they ever saw
large grows Yeah, you know like
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses full acres of that type of
thing I mean there was obviously some
[SPEAKER_03]: select people that had done that
themselves but for the most part people
[SPEAKER_03]: first saw that on cannabis world and You
know and we learned a lot I mean and that
[SPEAKER_03]: was also to what Raho was saying Sam skunk
man had about four or five different hands
[SPEAKER_03]: He was know-it-all for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was jingles He was Sam skunk man and
you started getting people that got
[SPEAKER_03]: started getting very vocal about their
version of their narrative Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and pushing that narrative very hard and
what we've learned over time with the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums is that the people that are often
and early they You know typically that
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes sort of like, you know cannabis
lore Yeah, right and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that might add more nuance to it
but the people that were Willing to get
[SPEAKER_03]: out there and type it up and put their
story out first It carried a lot of weight
[SPEAKER_05]: that people were willing to do that We we
had an example earlier before you popped
[SPEAKER_05]: on where we were talking about the chem
dog story and we popped up an old a graph
[SPEAKER_05]: of like, you know chem 91 Chem D and then
maybe chem four I think and it was like
[SPEAKER_05]: the tree of lineage of things that have
been crossed to it and what was related to
[SPEAKER_05]: it and stuff and that lore has been there
for ages and even You know the other day
[SPEAKER_05]: we brought it up that the things are
always fluid and changing as we learn new
[SPEAKER_05]: things So yeah, so it was a good example
of it Yeah, I definitely and you know one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that I think we should mention too
is that so I live I live in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_03]: County, which is like tons of people grow
weed So yeah, I was able to hang out with
[SPEAKER_03]: folks And talk weed a lot all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just part of my daily life but the
forums what was so attractive about the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums and my opinion was it was the first
time that like nationally and
[SPEAKER_03]: internationally people could talk and
there was a lot of people that started
[SPEAKER_03]: talking from You know places that were
much more sketchy back then Police states
[SPEAKER_03]: if you will states that didn't have any
medical didn't have any recreate didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have any of that Yeah, and so for a lot of
those people the only place they felt safe
[SPEAKER_03]: to talk about it was online They didn't
talk about it with their friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't talk about it with their
neighbors there might Be a tiny percentage
[SPEAKER_03]: of people that even knew what they were up
to yeah, but if they were weed nerds they
[SPEAKER_03]: had this burning desire to chat about it
and online provided a semi anonymous way
[SPEAKER_03]: to shoot the shit about cannabis and It
was really interesting for a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: because before then it was just small
circles and groups and you know and
[SPEAKER_03]: friendships and You know, you really
didn't see how the other half was living
[SPEAKER_05]: and pay phones and pay phones So mad jag,
what was your what was your first form
[SPEAKER_05]: experience?
[SPEAKER_05]: What brought an old vet like you onto the
scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: to mess with the newer generation well
when Arizona went medical I got my green
[SPEAKER_02]: card in 2012 and Because I was more than
25 miles from the nearest dispensary I was
[SPEAKER_02]: able to it said license to cultivate so I
could grow my six plants in my backyard or
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 whatever it was and I Felt relieved
because I was doing it semi-legal I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: that you always supposed to have an
enclosure with eight foot walls and one
[SPEAKER_02]: inch thick metal door some crazy yeah
regulations, but I Decided mine was safe
[SPEAKER_02]: enough close enough and I started
searching online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Done quite a bit of research already
on weed just to see what was on the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet probably starting back I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go to a store in Sedona.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a t1 line You know t1 was like
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah This is during dial-up days Yeah,
and the dial-up at home if you were trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to even look at one photo you would wait a
minute So in single naked lady took
[SPEAKER_02]: forever So going going to the this video
store that also had t1 lines They had
[SPEAKER_02]: little booths where you could get on the
internet and it was fast I could do in one
[SPEAKER_02]: hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would take me five at home?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it was I think it was nine
dollars an hour 13 is there t1 and somehow
[SPEAKER_02]: I've then I started Well, that was the
early stuff, but later once I got my
[SPEAKER_02]: license in medical I thought Wonder what
the seed worlds like and I started looking
[SPEAKER_02]: around and I found mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice forum of mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice seeds and some of the original people
On there like since Amia And a few others
[SPEAKER_02]: became sort of friends, you know,
I talked to them on on the forum there and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where I met braho he had a
different handle at that time and One
[SPEAKER_02]: thing led to another then I went I
discovered I see mag and I joined in 2012
[SPEAKER_02]: and the same year and A little time went
by And then I think it was Elmer bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was either Raho Raho You remember it
was either you or Elmer that invited me to
[SPEAKER_03]: this other forum called for myself I can
say that the the thing that was so crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: for me about Mr. Nice specifically was I
think it was I can't remember if it was oh
[SPEAKER_03]: nine or 2010 but all of a sudden Neville
popped up on there and started answering
[SPEAKER_03]: questions Yeah, and I was like,
oh my god you can just talk to him and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can ask him all these burning things that
I wanted to know about and then There was
[SPEAKER_03]: people like he went by dog list,
but there was you know Ortega there was
[SPEAKER_03]: some other various like heavy hitters from
that zone that like once they realized
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville was on there they joined to Sam
Yeah, and then Yosemite Sam from Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_03]: and then so as some of those real people
started joining There was an era there
[SPEAKER_03]: from probably I don't know 2009 to maybe
2011 or something Where all the sudden for
[SPEAKER_03]: me being a younger guy compared to those
guys you could listen to some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Giants talk about Maple leaf or talk about
this or you could ask Neville questions
[SPEAKER_03]: directly about some of his lines and he'd
give you answers and where he got the and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Seattle Greg was posting on there
about the NL and all of a sudden you had
[SPEAKER_03]: this collection of You know of sort of
like what I call like first generation,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Growers and breeders and hustlers
and movers and shakers all communicating
[SPEAKER_03]: and you could read what they were talking
about to each other Yeah, it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's such an awesome well and so,
you know and and then so I kind of felt
[SPEAKER_03]: like I was a fly on the wall and I started
screaming, you know, I started saving
[SPEAKER_03]: basically every Neville post and every you
know, like of course it starts all the
[SPEAKER_03]: arguments in the back and forth and like
the are you telling the truths and like
[SPEAKER_03]: the do you remember this the right way
type of deal And but yeah that that was
[SPEAKER_03]: what was so fascinating to me about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr Nice was that all of a sudden all these
cannabis like legends Pretty much everyone
[SPEAKER_05]: with the exception of Sam Yeah,
I know Sam would have we would have we
[SPEAKER_05]: were talking about the wars earlier like
me and a few others would go invade I see
[SPEAKER_05]: mag and do the jib jab means like the fake
kung fu ones Representing Neville and it
[SPEAKER_05]: would be like arguments between Neville
and Sam and we would post those on I see
[SPEAKER_05]: mad and they'd come back on mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice and post theirs over on ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a yeah, it was a full-on war
Matt that was the first that was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time I saw you Matt, you know met work it
met you on line anyway, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but you know not so you're right
that was a magic moment at Mr Nice when
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville came back there and you know the
ability of any member to just pop in and
[SPEAKER_01]: asking questions and you know,
like just and the attraction the how how
[SPEAKER_01]: people could not stay away like You
mentioned camera and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt was there, of course Who else dog was
heavy And big and big herb and there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: big herb was definitely there There was a
lot of people that were that were involved
[SPEAKER_03]: and like hang Kanga Kanga Vida and when I
first got when I first started really
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting people in Amsterdam I realized
that like there was a bunch of older guys
[SPEAKER_03]: that had beefs with each other that didn't
get a lot Long exactly and they had their
[SPEAKER_03]: versions of events and then they would
just continue said war on whatever forum
[SPEAKER_03]: got created This is my story and then
they'd be like, no, no, no, that's
[SPEAKER_03]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what happened You're so full of it
and there was these camps that would form
[SPEAKER_03]: on like Matt and I joke about it of like
which shady character Do you believe more?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because you could poke holes in any
of us really to some do yeah, you know and
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that was dogless dogless Was
Ortega, you know and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he gave Neville four or five super
important lines That still remain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of mystery to them But just
watching those older guys communicate with
[SPEAKER_03]: each other and dropping things that were
maybe normal to them But were gems to us
[SPEAKER_03]: was a was a pretty magical time that era
of mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice forums was pretty cool Yeah Yeah and
and of course like like you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: there were other other people that weren't
big shots at the time But turned into big,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know people that that we've all heard
of today And had valuable things and
[SPEAKER_03]: valuable insight, you know to add to like,
you know What what what was Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_03]: like in that early late 60s early 70s era?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was this going on and some different
depth to things and so there was some
[SPEAKER_03]: really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Intelligent cannabis conversation going on
In those years right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah a lot of it sadly some of those Old
Neville posts have been Disappeared
[SPEAKER_01]: manicured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're getting they're getting
cleaned up to help with the clutter Yes,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think anything anything contrary,
you know Last night I did you see that
[SPEAKER_05]: when I think I texted to you last night
not so it was a screenshot of a post from
[SPEAKER_05]: Shanti saying that Nordal is super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, he did that on IG two days ago
or something like that Was that confusing
[SPEAKER_05]: to you at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't so much confusing I mean the the
problem that you have with anyone not just
[SPEAKER_03]: Shanti but with anyone is that you get
their version of what's going on and do
[SPEAKER_03]: you have others that will Can corroborate
like what they're talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and it's like, you know I know
for a fact we know for a fact that Sean
[SPEAKER_03]: that Neville sold a huge amount of seeds
to Shanti and that they work together and
[SPEAKER_03]: did various things together for a period
of time and So there's this No seed
[SPEAKER_03]: company that I'm aware of is ever admitted
that they've ever lost anything ever As
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon Simon has admitted he's lost the
parents to Kelly missed in general in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, you know, like that's shocking
This is what's crazy is you guys is that
[SPEAKER_03]: like if you go on since he seeds website
right now They still have Neville photos
[SPEAKER_03]: from the 80s Yeah as their description,
you know for their depicts for their
[SPEAKER_03]: descriptions of their lines and those and
those photos Were taken in 1988 1989 and
[SPEAKER_03]: 1990.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they're still the same ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even the worst part though I
mean then you read the stories and it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes it sound like the drunkers Climbed
their way through the Himalayas to get no
[SPEAKER_01]: meet the farmers, you know, and they
personally brought it back You know that
[SPEAKER_01]: these in a CIA helicopter, you know,
I mean it's just It's insane Neville was
[SPEAKER_03]: the only one to admit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we lost that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah this day Yeah, this changed that was
my fault and the rest of them almost
[SPEAKER_03]: universally are like that makes
identifying things difficult because You
[SPEAKER_03]: know that people obviously don't want to
admit that they lose certain things
[SPEAKER_03]: because they want those modern sales
Right, but you know that it goes beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: that though I mean, let's assume that the
cuts got lost but so what did they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: dig through to replace it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are they you know, of course
they never Admit that they lost anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we'll take that for granted and
then then we assume okay They they won't
[SPEAKER_01]: admit it, but we know they've lost
something So what did they have to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with to to pick the replacements
themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know in the case of Neville he did you
know?
[SPEAKER_01]: He a lot of the posts that were deleted
were talking about Indica's and his
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding work with Indica's yeah and Which
is interesting because I haven't seen that
[SPEAKER_01]: insta post that you're talking about where
they're they're claiming that that nortal
[SPEAKER_01]: is Super stunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you know, you can see that this
is one of those things where that's
[SPEAKER_01]: partially true You know, so the parents of
soup super skunk Afghan tea and and skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: one are contained in normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep Sure, no doubt, but do we think it's
pure Afghan tea plus plus skunk one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean Oh how we wish it was right,
but it's not a Neville in those old posts
[SPEAKER_01]: that are now missing it talked about How
he mixed he crossed all of those maple
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuttings together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, he had the or 15 the
Afghan s Afghan tea and big bud Kush for
[SPEAKER_01]: and one that was a big bud like yeah He
called it big bud, but it was not the big
[SPEAKER_05]: bud string, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead I always view Shanti is a bit
like the the the bridge troll or the
[SPEAKER_03]: sphinx that wants you to Answer the three
riddles and and so, you know, you're like
[SPEAKER_03]: just give it to me clear and he'll just
like, you know He'll dance around the
[SPEAKER_03]: topic You know, and so, you know,
we know One of the interesting things that
[SPEAKER_03]: we found out is that we weren't exactly
sure how large the collection that he
[SPEAKER_03]: bought off Neville was and apparently it's
so large that people Involved think that
[SPEAKER_03]: he couldn't even get through it in a
lifetime if he wanted to Wow So then it
[SPEAKER_03]: really just becomes about like does he
have the eye and does he have the
[SPEAKER_03]: selection?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he has the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just he you know, how many mothers
does he have?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many fathers does he have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he pulling them out of f2s?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I agree completely, but there's
actually something even more and does is
[SPEAKER_01]: he even doing this selecting himself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean because I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some I've seen some people
working Ortega and and some other some
[SPEAKER_01]: other fresh seeds from them that don't
look The the the phenos that I saw,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know 15 well 10 10 years ago are not
in there anymore Yeah, and it was like
[SPEAKER_03]: dude I don't mean to tell you if if we
would have known if I would have known
[SPEAKER_03]: That basically every five or ten years the
seed game Completely changes and what you
[SPEAKER_03]: thought would be available for a long time
has now disappeared forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm You know Matt and I were looking at
we I have a friend with a freezer that got
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the gate Game and gave all of his
seeds to a good friend of ours and most of
[SPEAKER_03]: most of those seeds are from 2009 to 2012
and Matt and I were just shocked that like
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe 1% of those seeds are still
available today if you wanted to buy them
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, you know the the Neville era the
sensei era this the serious era like all
[SPEAKER_03]: these different seed companies Maybe they
have the same stock for four or five years
[SPEAKER_03]: right and then something happens like we
know that Shauncey got rated and in
[SPEAKER_03]: Switzerland, what did he lose then?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did he have before?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did he have after and a lot of those
cases?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't it doesn't benefit them in any
way to like be completely upfront.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then they're not You know, yeah Yeah,
and and I've been we've been trying to get
[SPEAKER_03]: Shauncey to admit for years if Nordal was
his version of super skunk Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he never would Remember do you
remember?
[SPEAKER_05]: Raho when this strain came out because it
was originally another strain that he had
[SPEAKER_05]: listed and I think it was just called
Afghan skunk at the time and he said I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: changing this to Nordal in honor of What
it was fucking in honor of maybe the nice
[SPEAKER_01]: movie coming out Yeah, it was the code
name that Howard Marks used to describe a
[SPEAKER_05]: load of hash But I think it was because
the movie was coming out in UK and he
[SPEAKER_05]: renamed it in honor of the movie because
in the movie They make that a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay To that too because I met Neville
briefly a few times and one of his
[SPEAKER_03]: partners in the 90s in Amsterdam and after
he left Sensei he had to call super skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: ultra skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm because Sensei had trademarked the
names to most of his genetics Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so therefore since he owned the name
super skunk and so from the time he I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember because I bought some ultra
skunk he had To call it ultra skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in that case if Shanti was gonna
sell his version He literally couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: sell super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only people that can sell super skunk
in Holland are sensei seeds gotcha because
[SPEAKER_03]: they bought they owned the They they
trademarked almost all the names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of shocked He didn't like throw
devil in there and shit and like all the
[SPEAKER_05]: other stuff that are like Afghan skunks,
you know So there's so I do give Shanti a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of slack in the sense that he
Has to be it's hard to it's hard to say
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these things because they're off
There is some legality and that's what's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of going on now too is people are
starting to try to patent names in America
[SPEAKER_03]: In different areas in different regions
and being like, oh well, we have this name
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know But it's interesting too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, like the one name that
they didn't pack for some reason They
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have a patent on nl5 haze But they
do on super skunk Yeah, that's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: the Illuminati has something to do with
that yeah, they can Illuminati and then
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, and then and then he and then they
patented all the nl names You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so they had to call the nl stuff different
work Yeah, that's why that's why I believe
[SPEAKER_03]: was a Dutch passion Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to call their nl2 version Oasis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out we'll find out they seem to
be open to talking and Yeah, I will say
[SPEAKER_05]: Dutch passion out of all The Dutch
companies I've ever reached out to Dutch
[SPEAKER_05]: passions like been open to sending me
their old catalogs scanning them in like
[SPEAKER_05]: helping with the archive So I'm stoked to
interview them because they have an actual
[SPEAKER_05]: genuine interest in the culture And I
remember like they were actually have been
[SPEAKER_05]: at the forefront of some cannabis
technology I want to ask them about their
[SPEAKER_05]: artificial seeds They were the first to
push artificial seeds and in sell bows and
[SPEAKER_05]: some of their cloned clonal strains as
artificial seeds and It disappeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they only tried it in
Europe for a while, but it was it was so
[SPEAKER_05]: far ahead of its time This is like 2012
when they were doing artificial seeds So I
[SPEAKER_03]: even think they were the first person I
ever saw talk about feminized work I think
[SPEAKER_05]: there are some of the first that were
selling feminized before Americans,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know people like you Matt or CSI I
think they coined the term Feminized they
[SPEAKER_03]: go you rascal some of the first people
that were involved on the American side of
[SPEAKER_03]: things I think I first saw it from Dutch
passion offering up You know feminized the
[SPEAKER_01]: term I didn't know anybody ever made some
of the sold some of those artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, which is basically a Tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right in a tiny little capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that basically the idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some sort of Mary stem or whatever
It's some kind of clonal tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I remember Camaro was talking about
that and I was like, yeah, this is another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm never gonna see Yeah, yeah,
I was super stoked when they started doing
[SPEAKER_05]: it but the problem is because it's a It's
it is tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everyone can get these things to
quote-unquote germinate, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it takes real genuine care Yeah,
you don't just throw it out in the yard
[SPEAKER_01]: and set up the sprinkler, you know,
I mean the idea was that you like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: the idea was that you could hopefully like
plant it under dirt and it'll just grow
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean people have enough time hard
time popping normal seeds, let alone
[SPEAKER_01]: artificial seeds, you know Well,
he was talking about that stuff about the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time that he was Doing his massive
clone collecting all over North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's that Camaro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was talking about oh,
we're gonna make these artificial seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be tissue culture and we'll
preserve them forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it gave everybody the idea idea
that he was gonna be the dude Repository
[SPEAKER_01]: of all this precious germplasm for the
rest of the world, you know, and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna out of the goodness of his heart I
will say that when I was reading on the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder's lab on overgrow That Camaro was
one of the most intimidating people on
[SPEAKER_03]: there at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was probably in my early 20s then and
the depth of like breeding knowledge that
[SPEAKER_03]: he had like in the education that he had
and sort of like the Ego and
[SPEAKER_03]: dismissiveness that he had like it it
really made me But it also made me It
[SPEAKER_03]: intimidated me for for lack of a better
term.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like am I how am I but then there's
this weird part where the older I've
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten I definitely think we need you need
to know some of that but breeding is as
[SPEAKER_03]: much art as it is science to me and you
really have to have the eye and some luck
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe and Really and really test it
smoking wise and see what's going on
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not just strict science What
you're after is invisible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we were talking about we were
talking about this the other day It's so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's great point, you know of all
these all these multi-million dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: bankroll Genetics operations that are
trying to come up with the next big thing
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis, you know What if they
produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year a new batch of winners comes
from from you know from banjo playing
[SPEAKER_01]: moonshiners in the hills Yeah blow away
everything that was done the year before
[SPEAKER_01]: and yet you got these boys in their white
lab coats and you know with the with the
[SPEAKER_01]: gas chromatographs You know looking at the
DNA and what are they coming up with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually talking about that I will say
that I saw an interview with Shanti that
[SPEAKER_03]: made that I kind of totally agreed with
him where he said That his CBD work is
[SPEAKER_03]: very scientific and it's very documented
and it's very by the book and it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: that way But he said the cannabis side is
almost all judgment and art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I found that Very interesting
observation that he felt like the science
[SPEAKER_03]: of getting these CBD CBG CBN type things
It was very very documented based and it
[SPEAKER_03]: was very very testing based and he said
the cannabis side is still the eye It's
[SPEAKER_01]: still looking and hunting, you know part
some of the goals of that of that CBD or
[SPEAKER_01]: the hemp market is to come up with strains
that will will produce from seed
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently low levels of THC with you
know those those threshold levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that allow them to legally
grow it and it's and it's really it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: tricky to do that and then once they once
they figure out how to isolate,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know certain ratios and they're
they're trying to Explore that and create,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in strains and seed that can
produce other cannabinoids, you know to
[SPEAKER_01]: the exclusions of others All of this made
necessary by regulation, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know if you could just grow You could
separate the different cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: have one plant that grew them all but you
know because the laws differentiates
[SPEAKER_01]: between hemp and and Regular drug cannabis
and you know, they have to treat these
[SPEAKER_01]: things differently But yeah, I mean one
thing that's interesting about that too
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was like my second favorite part of
that Shanti interview was that he said
[SPEAKER_03]: that one of the differences between what
he was doing with his crew and others is
[SPEAKER_03]: that a lot of others were working with
hemp to breed CBD And CBN CBG stuff and he
[SPEAKER_03]: was trying to breed that stuff from drug
cultivars and bring it out in the regular
[SPEAKER_03]: lines that had already been bred for
Consumption and I thought that was an
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting approach, you know,
he wasn't necessarily trying to breed it
[SPEAKER_03]: from hemp He was trying to bring it out in
the lines that already existed from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis side of things Yeah, I don't know
I've grown some of his lines that look
[SPEAKER_01]: like they might have had
[SPEAKER_03]: This is completely off-topic and I'm not
trying to derail it but Raho your new
[SPEAKER_03]: avatar is the stuff of nightmares But to
get back on to get back on target for a
[SPEAKER_03]: second one of the things that I do think
was revolutionary about the forums opening
[SPEAKER_03]: up was it really was the first time that
people outside their own friend groups in
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis space could start
communicating with each other and people
[SPEAKER_03]: from different parts of America Or Europe
or Australia or wherever could start
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about something in ways that had
never happened before and so despite all
[SPEAKER_03]: the Attacks and poop-throwing and wars
that got started over things and people
[SPEAKER_03]: being mean behind their keyboard It really
did advance a lot of things and it really
[SPEAKER_03]: did give a base For people to start
discussing things in public Because at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time that all those at the time that all
those things first came out I think
[SPEAKER_03]: overgrows Started in the very late 90s if
I recall correctly only California had
[SPEAKER_03]: medical at that time Yes, so it was just
in the infancy of you know, not being
[SPEAKER_03]: totally illegal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and you know, and it started to
slowly spread but I do think that You know
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a lot of people we could
probably talk about like like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know We had everyone laughs when I
said hempy the reason why everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: laughed was because he was a you know he
was argumentative, you know, and people
[SPEAKER_03]: had personalities and people like Vic high
or You know people were famously like my
[SPEAKER_03]: god, you say the wrong thing to Tom Hill
20 years ago And he would just tear your
[SPEAKER_03]: head off 20 years ago Back then,
you know like yeah in that in that era and
[SPEAKER_03]: so there started being the first like weed
internet personalities and then when
[SPEAKER_03]: people like Sam skunk man got online or
people like Khmer like There was like
[SPEAKER_03]: heroes that started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah And it was also the first era to me
where visual aspects of cannabis became
[SPEAKER_03]: very important like when people started
posting their stories around You know
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and people started posting these
crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's where your passion for it
started right Matt You start going online
[SPEAKER_03]: and looking at these posts and you're
like, what is that thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what is this story and what is this
name?
[SPEAKER_03]: And why does it look so mutant and why is
it blue and why does it have all these
[SPEAKER_03]: purple leaves and Especially like pre
cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was wild looking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I was you know And people
started exchanging legends and like I
[SPEAKER_03]: still have things saved, you know from you
know, Ken Gavita and these different guys
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about the different get Tiva food
and get Tiva sees I'm talking about the
[SPEAKER_03]: mate mangling it but posting these mullum,
you know these these different mullum
[SPEAKER_03]: Finos and where people got things and
these on these old-school photos and You
[SPEAKER_03]: know stuff from Switzerland and all that
and it started Giving people a view into
[SPEAKER_03]: other people's gardens almost for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah outside of friend groups What's this
magic from from Reiko?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Was gonna ask if either of you know
Reiko, I don't know him personally,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I know who he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay Says his joint date was 2006 but this
is these are photos from 2004 of a 79 AFI
[SPEAKER_02]: and a Pakistani 1982.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah The different structures look at him
one looks like Urkel a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a packie on the left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would guess Yeah, the left is an
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow Well, look at my dumbass fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Wow, that's very cool The one on the
left looks like Baba to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah Deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just see Urkel looking at that bad
boy Has that same overly leafy structure
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know, it's funny actually I got a
picture of g13 the other day and ran it by
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville's old partner and he's like,
yeah, that is g13 That's exactly how I
[SPEAKER_05]: remember her and it was from an old cat
and it wasn't even a catalog It was an old
[SPEAKER_05]: magazine clipping I think from High Times
or head magazine one of the two and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: of Neville's grow room and had g13 had a
few shots of nl5 But that also got
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville's old partner to tell us that g13
was Apple smelling green apple smelling
[SPEAKER_05]: which I never knew and I've always heard
burnt rubber all this other stuff But I've
[SPEAKER_05]: never heard it directly from any source
that had it, you know, like what the the
[SPEAKER_01]: scent profile was and he says green apple
Yeah, I can hear that as you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can interpret that as being kind of
salary citrusy maybe you know with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of that that acidic bite not
necessarily citrus but The other thing he
[SPEAKER_03]: has some too the other thing I found crazy
about the forums is like you jump on and
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd see some threads that would get
locked and Then you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh why did that get locked and you jump on
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's like all these spicy
arguments that go see my name About what's
[SPEAKER_03]: true and what's not and there's people
that you know That was kind of the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time where your popularity in some
instances Like led people to whether they
[SPEAKER_03]: were gonna believe you or not Mmm,
and people would start poking holes in the
[SPEAKER_03]: stories and it's also this same era where
a lot of the people have told a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: stories on various forums at various times
and some of those legends don't line up
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's like all their own words and so
in 2004 this is what I wrote and then in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2010 I kind of changed it and I wrote this
and now in 2018 I'm talking about this and
[SPEAKER_03]: now today I'm talking this yeah,
and it's interesting because it puts down
[SPEAKER_03]: on not on paper necessarily But it puts
down to some degree a record You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some things like IC mag like you
guys were mentioning even on mr Nice It
[SPEAKER_03]: puts it down on a record until someone in
the managerial Capacity on the forum
[SPEAKER_03]: decides to either walk or eliminate
certain posts because it doesn't fit a
[SPEAKER_03]: narrative Yeah, so it's not perfect
because definitely on IC mag there's been
[SPEAKER_03]: there's been things that have gone off the
reservation if you will and The thread or
[SPEAKER_05]: certain comments disappears Yeah,
and I I try to remind that to people who
[SPEAKER_05]: are researching nowadays They it's it's
hard to remember a few things if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: like, let's say you you showed up 2016
past, you know 1015 after that what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at is a very It's just a small
sample of the forums that were available
[SPEAKER_05]: like IC mag THC farmer roll it up But
there were a lot more reforms than that a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of private forums like we talked about
there were There were other just smaller
[SPEAKER_05]: forums couch lot cafe, you know pot pimp
There were there were a bunch of them out
[SPEAKER_05]: there and those are long gone seed depot
gone and you're seeing a small section and
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of these forums were run by people
Selling either a seed bank or had a seed
[SPEAKER_05]: bank carrying many breeders or were run by
a breeder themselves and 99% of the time
[SPEAKER_05]: you were it was very clicky so you'd have
people who Were asked kissy to the owner
[SPEAKER_05]: of the forum They would become the
moderators and it would become a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: cheerleader rah-rah stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like And it happened everywhere
even on my forum, you know, like that I
[SPEAKER_05]: ran it was it was very Riot centric
because that's just the way it worked out,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know But people are seeing a very
small screenshot So if you're coming into
[SPEAKER_05]: the forum era now trying to go back
research You're missing a lot of context
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lot of data is mainly what I'm
trying to say Yeah, people people delete
[SPEAKER_01]: posts they threads are locked or post
deleted sometimes You know entire threads
[SPEAKER_01]: are removed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, do you guys do you guys remember the
crusty buckets?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah There was these Canadians on
there that were growing like in in grow
[SPEAKER_03]: rocks and they were growing like very few
plants But they were growing two to four
[SPEAKER_03]: pound plants inside on this crazy
hydroponic NFT method called crusty
[SPEAKER_03]: buckets and there would be some forums
There would be some threads that would
[SPEAKER_03]: just go on for hundreds of pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah a combination of people asking tons
of questions or the original poster
[SPEAKER_03]: posting updates You know people started
posting like grow picks and you know Like
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought these seeds from this group
follow along as I pop these things and see
[SPEAKER_03]: what I find And you know and and a lot of
like Matt's right in a lot of those cases
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was specific to like who the
breeders were on the various forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I have a bunch of cool picks
from mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice of various people trying out
different seeds or some of those old
[SPEAKER_03]: timers coming on and You know posting
stuff that they had And then you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh that person saw that in that era Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay I'm gonna really like pay
attention to what he's speaking about
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know, there's not very many
references to it Do either you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: remember bite me from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I can't find him and I've been
trying to find him I know you guys have
[SPEAKER_05]: other old friends out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So put the word out for him He was such a
nice gentleman an old smuggler and he's
[SPEAKER_05]: responsible for one of my best-selling
lines of all time I'd never been able to
[SPEAKER_05]: thank him, but he was a wonderful
wonderful, dude Yeah, so Florida see what
[SPEAKER_03]: I can find there was a guy on there named
Big Sur Who used to post a lot about
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently he was from Central Central,
California same general Santa Cruz type of
[SPEAKER_03]: region and you know He offered up a lot of
his opinions on like what was around and
[SPEAKER_03]: what he was seeing and what haze was like
and like different You know just different
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that and whether it's true or
not It's always valuable to get different
[SPEAKER_03]: people's opinions Yeah on the same era
because people have different memories and
[SPEAKER_01]: different experiences, too It's a it's a
little sad when you see people like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I'm not gonna say Big Sur cuz I'm
not sure if this applies to him,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know older guys telling stories
From way back and and they're active and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're up there, you know every week or
you know every couple of months They'll
[SPEAKER_01]: show up and they're talking about what
they're doing and over time that they just
[SPEAKER_01]: start kind of Dropping off showing up less
often until finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't come back Yeah,
you know seen enough of those The just the
[SPEAKER_01]: really old stories kind of like what what
we're you know Jaggi and I started talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about when we came on here are The older
ones are are disappearing at a rapid rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you guys got us on here I
don't I don't like to think of myself as
[SPEAKER_01]: being in that category of a you know a
perishable item passed the sell-by date on
[SPEAKER_03]: the shelf, but Yeah, I mean I used to ask
this is probably 20 years ago now But I
[SPEAKER_03]: used to ask my grandpa like what it was
like getting old And he was he says,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know is the weirdest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes in my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like 28 with a bunch of wisdom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah until I drop something on the floor
and then I bend over to pick it up and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh I'm old, you know and and it's
crazy too because it's like that to me
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know I grew up in the 80s the
80s doesn't seem all that long ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: but boy It's getting farther away all the
time and you know the like the first and
[SPEAKER_03]: second generation even of cannabis growers
in America that span the 60s and 70s those
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that's you know, there's there's
less and less, you know Viewpoints and
[SPEAKER_03]: then the 80s even there's less and less
viewpoints and so that kind of history
[SPEAKER_03]: like that's why I think this is so cool of
what we're all doing is like getting some
[SPEAKER_03]: of that oral history down whether it's
written down or whether it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know talked about on like this is
pretty important or a strain or a strain
[SPEAKER_05]: index online that you know, one of those
things really one of the craziest things
[SPEAKER_03]: about this was like being able to talk to
Madjag about like skunk one from the late
[SPEAKER_03]: 70s or early 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like that's wild to me because
having someone that had actual experience
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it then like and growing a good
amount of it and being able to see what it
[SPEAKER_03]: was really like Incredibly rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only that to me It's it's not just
having someone with experience that grew
[SPEAKER_05]: it back then but someone that had
experience growing other stuff and had
[SPEAKER_05]: experience with cannabis and different the
different experiences cannabis had to
[SPEAKER_05]: offer already before growing skunk one so
they could sense those nuances those fine
[SPEAKER_05]: difference and smells that to me is what
what separates the this story specifically
[SPEAKER_05]: from a lot of other people's old tales.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I agree skunk one and 85,
you know, it was skunky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is this is having someone with
with the nose in the eye that was there
[SPEAKER_05]: that is is interested in the genetic
aspect to that's as nerdy as all of us and
[SPEAKER_05]: as advanced as an archive as he is,
I think that was that was key and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: really important to have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that super humbles me in
cannabis is that it seems like the early
[SPEAKER_03]: raw work that people do ends up being the
best and then they get older and more
[SPEAKER_03]: experienced and they try to make it better
and they make it worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, and you know, Neville
admitted that like he got the haze and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, the F ones were the coolest thing he
ever did with them and the more work he
[SPEAKER_03]: put into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, none of the poly hybrids were
nearly as nice as like the what the first
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses I made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I tried and I tried and I
tried and I tried and then I had to agree
[SPEAKER_03]: that like the first stuff I did was better
than anything I did after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, can I ask you guys a little NL
question?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever found an NL Fino that was
high interpenelene?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to say yes in NL five by two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the NL five by two repros
that came out from old stock have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: mild to moderate interpenelene nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pakistanis have it as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chitrali.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's in the Afghan Pakistani lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that interpenelene is so so
strongly associated with Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard you guys talk about that
once you get it in a line, it's it's damn
[SPEAKER_01]: near impossible to breed it out if you
decide you don't want it in there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of curious because, you know,
I think a lot of people associate that
[SPEAKER_01]: interpenelene with haze a.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really get those phenos in an
SSH or a mango or any of those other skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: NL haze combos that are around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get that heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get it from Neville's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people think, OK, well, what's the
difference between Neville's and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Haze a is the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they immediately attribute that
interpenelene to the haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm wondering if it would just was the
female that he used to make Neville's haze
[SPEAKER_01]: that had a interpenelene Dom, you know,
northern lights mama.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the interesting part about that is that
if you believe Neville's tale about NL
[SPEAKER_03]: five, he grew a bunch of the seeds and
they were a big mix of Indica sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid phenos that were all over the place
and crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was this one phenom he found
that almost looked pure Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one that he picked to breed
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the seed line itself was definitely a
Afghan sativa mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's entirely possible that in
Neville's selection of NL five,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was some genes in there that
combined with other genes could pop out
[SPEAKER_03]: that interpenelene in plants very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, Matt's going to get excited about
this because I remember Neville's
[SPEAKER_01]: statements differently than what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you're saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: He went through the seeds he got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were two.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, he wanted cuttings and seeds
from the original NL crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he had a falling out with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what it was about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wound up going to kind of somebody
in the NL crew orbit, not the original
[SPEAKER_01]: guys to get those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that Seattle Greg was the guy in the
orbit?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe Seattle Greg was the original
guy that he was getting him from.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I remember correctly, it was Don
Downs, the Indian, that he got it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: second time and that he was around them
that he wasn't he wasn't a veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: His son had served or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they kind of anyway,
it's it's got all the hallmarks of one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those old bullshit legendary stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the the main thing is,
is that Neville Neville Blue is deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: the original guys and wound up going to
kind of a side periphery guy to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that he would ultimately work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those seeds, you know, that Neville
said that he concluded that the five the
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting he kept as NL five, he believed
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you just dropped five by two.
[SPEAKER_01]: He differentiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: five cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that there were only two true true
breeding male lines in everything that he
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the NL one and the NL two were the
two male ones he had to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he called the NL one a pure Afghan and
he called the NL two a Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Kush type, you know, based mainly on
the smell of juniper.
[SPEAKER_03]: But and he said that the rest of them were
a big hybrid mix and a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he might have said that they came
labeled as this and that and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tended to run true to what the
description said they would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might be mixing that up,
but I think that's what he wound up
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some some would be more
narrowly than the others, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: based on what they've been out crossed
with hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as I understood it, Neville,
he had the five clone right from from Greg
[SPEAKER_05]: and crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got that later after he had done his
own selection of of Neville's five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless, regardless, when he got it,
he didn't like theirs so much,
[SPEAKER_05]: according to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he made his own cross that he called
NL five using the Steve Murphy Afghan and
[SPEAKER_05]: what his mazar or the Steve Murphy Afghan
cross to the Hawaiian cross to his mazar
[SPEAKER_05]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a cool story.
[SPEAKER_03]: They agree when they finally when when
they got the NL five clone that they had
[SPEAKER_03]: selected from America and he got to
Amsterdam, apparently they sent it over in
[SPEAKER_03]: a terrarium full of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to get the clone over there,
they took a pair of scissors and they cut
[SPEAKER_03]: off all of the serrations on every leaf of
the NL five.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Greg, I asked Greg this story.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, no, they took it to a florist who
made a flower pot type thing, and they
[SPEAKER_05]: just stuck that in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he didn't know anything about the
serrations.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe maybe it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The florist might have done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that Greg mentioned that that
Matt and I never knew whether to believe
[SPEAKER_03]: or not was Greg always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg said in this one post one time on Mr.
Nice, in fact, that the NL one was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually Steve Murphy Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that he had gotten from Steve Murphy
combined with a Neville Afghan he got from
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people speculate all the time about
which of Neville's Afghan that was that
[SPEAKER_01]: was used to make the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Neville never answered the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for anybody to say it's this
one or that one, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no evidence to support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just one.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like one or two people I can ask
that may know, but not more than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even they I doubt they know that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's one of those ones that
the people who are saying those things say
[SPEAKER_01]: it with such conviction that it sounds
like that, you know, they were there when
[SPEAKER_01]: it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, you know, it's so yeah,
the NL one is supposed to be the Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: Murphy Afghan times some other AFI from
Neville, apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what what it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the purest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the interesting part about the
interesting part about that is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you look at like Neville's NL
one, every time he tried to make a back
[SPEAKER_03]: cross or every time he tried to stabilize
something that was from clone,
[SPEAKER_03]: he always used NL one pollen to start the
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he said that it was the only pure
Afghan line he had that was reliable and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else he had that was an amazing
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got mostly in clone form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not so will devolve every show into a show
about Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every I mean, we were talking,
you know, he signed me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like he's like forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does it does suck because we were
also mentioning to get it back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why we sort of lost Neville on
Mr. Nice was him and Shanti behind the
[SPEAKER_03]: scenes kind of got into a tiff with each
other over money and access and seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville got mad and left.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will I will actually say exactly what
happened because I was there and he told
[SPEAKER_05]: me exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll tell people his opinion because he
was very adamant about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he sold Shanti the seeds when he
did for, I want to say, two hundred and
[SPEAKER_05]: fifty thousand dollars or one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one I can't quite recall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he felt that when he came back in
2010, that Shanti had more than made a
[SPEAKER_05]: fair share of profit and that he felt he
was still owed, even though that wasn't a
[SPEAKER_05]: part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: He felt he was still owed that money
because Shanti had capitalized very well
[SPEAKER_05]: on his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not just his work, but his name,
his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His reputation is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd been making it sound like those two
were, you know, back in the rooms together
[SPEAKER_01]: doing selections and shaking the mails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, listen, that wasn't
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Shanti working with Neville's
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally they'd exchange a message or
so, you know, like, how do I find a skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant that doesn't suck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Neville would say, well, you know,
if you figure it out, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, the opinion of a lot
of people there was that Shanti was not as
[SPEAKER_05]: upset or not as stoked with all the
attention Neville was getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: That seemed to be the general.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he wasn't back online.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that we could maybe ask Madjag
and Raho when you guys first started
[SPEAKER_03]: getting online and first started looking
at forums, what was the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: information or the kind of stuff you were
seeing that, like, really excited you or,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, changed, you know, like,
because, I mean, it's different for all of
[SPEAKER_03]: us, you know, but like, what was like,
you know, when you're perusing different
[SPEAKER_03]: threads and seeing different things,
were you after history?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you excited by some of the new stuff
you were seeing people post?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the ability just to connect and
start direct messaging with others?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it sounds like you guys built your
friendship off of the forums, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something interesting about the forums
that we haven't mentioned is that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a good number of people, as myself too,
that were banned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was banned from ICMAG and I was,
you know, I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you have done to get banned?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actively recruiting super nice
people and people who I liked for another
[SPEAKER_02]: forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a small forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're talking about forums,
then one day I came to get on ICMAG and it
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't let me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found out from other people who were
there saying, oh, your thread is still
[SPEAKER_02]: here, old school Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, but I can't get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I talked to, I actually emailed Tom
Hill somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember how I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tom should straighten things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send Tom in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got back in and he did something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it lasted for about two more weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was gone again for good.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the people, the only way it
happened, but one of the people that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: recruiting or asking if they'd like to
join this other forum, narked on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: How else would it happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never figured out who that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they were reading DMs like they always
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I waited a year and then I
went back on under a different name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was concerned that maybe they were
tracking IP addresses and they go,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, here's MAGIC trying to sneak back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been on since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go on about every six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went on today because my ex-girl
partner, I was telling Matt earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: released the information about the book he
wrote called Year of the MAGIC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a fictional story that uses our
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, did you meet Paul Newman
out in the desert on a motorcycle and save
[SPEAKER_01]: his life with some water and he rewarded
you by giving you a tab of something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't really know what it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that really happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: This fictional account?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my ex-girl partner and he's using the
name M-A-D space capital J-A-G.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just posted a little link on there
to my MAGIC.com website because five
[SPEAKER_02]: people have the right to use the name
MAGIC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talk about that on my website
because they were people who grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: With me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they deserve it, especially him,
because he did it for two years with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two big years when we grew skunk,
it was John.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he lives in Taos and he has for years,
40 years now, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's not worried about being exposed
or talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm mentioning it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope his book gets a lot of traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anybody listening right now,
when this book is out, please give it a
[SPEAKER_05]: look.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from one of the genuine partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's in ebook right now on Amazon,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Year of the Madjag.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the author's name?
[SPEAKER_02]: John Slater.
[SPEAKER_02]: S-L-A-T-O-R.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's J-O-N.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just John Slater.
[SPEAKER_02]: John worked in the BBC for 10 years before
he came to the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I tried to get him on a
particular forum, since we're speaking
[SPEAKER_02]: about forums, the fact that he was into
movies and film, all sorts of people got
[SPEAKER_02]: very paranoid and said, yeah, well,
what if he starts taking our photos and
[SPEAKER_02]: posting them and putting them in a
documentary?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he wasn't allowed to join because he
had too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: When somebody first comes on the forums,
just like John did back then, the author,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all of a sudden, you're inundated
with real live people's opinions about
[SPEAKER_01]: these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you've been looking at high
times or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you've seen is advertising
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glossy pictures, maybe some pretty girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mix it all up to hit you from every
angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's got an exciting story about
some intrepid adventurers climbing up into
[SPEAKER_01]: the freaking Himalayas and battling the
Yeti to steal his seed stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's half of the crowd on the forum
that you've decided to read is saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other half of the crowd is saying,
it's all true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you immediately realize that it's
neither all true or all false.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, that's kind of an eye opener.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the whole experience of group
dynamics, where people will line up around
[SPEAKER_01]: one color.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're for the red seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we only grow blue seeds around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a horrible thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not to answer your question,
I got on because I wanted to see what was
[SPEAKER_02]: out there in the whole weed world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it from my perspective and the
people I knew in Arizona and other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just had no idea that it was so
expansive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I saw Mr. Nice Seeds and all the
things that were possible, I bought some
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds in the auctions they had that were
in Switzerland, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were mailed from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got through fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were they in straws?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't on the hollow board yet,
the card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the ways that Shantze like those
guys like to send things, they would put
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds in like a plastic straw,
write the name on the straw, and then burn
[SPEAKER_03]: or seal the ends of the straw itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just why I ask, because I've
gotten straw corrugated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten lots of lots of straws from
Shanty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ordered from him before the
auctions, even if we want to date stamp
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, before we even started
auctions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got them in straws even then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you did you ever used to get Shanty's
old private email list of his seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to dig up one for not so
because he had never seen one of his old
[SPEAKER_05]: like when you were if you're one of the
breeders that was on a site during like
[SPEAKER_05]: that Neville era, he would share a list
with some people of the like one off
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses and stuff he made, you know,
you could buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he shared some people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, I've been trying to find one of
these old lists because I had a bunch,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I don't have them anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of just to just to fill in a
little bit, speaking of magic,
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about getting banned, there was
there was a lot of ways that people got
[SPEAKER_03]: banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it was you started talking about a
narrative that the owners or people that
[SPEAKER_03]: were connected to the owners of the site
didn't agree with.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it was just you would get on and
start talking your truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd be immediately crapped on
by a bunch of different people calling you
[SPEAKER_03]: a liar and calling you names.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's face it, like a lot of cannabis
people like, you know, social interaction
[SPEAKER_03]: is not our strong suit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get online and you start typing out
your truth or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a button and then 20 kids are
insulting you and telling you that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: a dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get mad and then you start saying
ruthless things back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, that's the Matt,
the Matt version.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get banned for, you know,
your thread gets locked because it goes
[SPEAKER_03]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about facts to like,
let's let's throw insults at one another
[SPEAKER_03]: until somebody cries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, forums were like and
there's also that, you know, you talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about the keyboard warrior thing where
anonymous people getting annoyed with each
[SPEAKER_03]: other can spit some pretty, you know,
pretty heated stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sometimes it's very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you, you know, there are some
legitimate long term liars and scammers
[SPEAKER_03]: that have used the forums to advance their
interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's also people like Madjag
or others coming out of the shadows just
[SPEAKER_03]: telling truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how sitting there in front of your
computer, do you differentiate between the
[SPEAKER_03]: two?
[SPEAKER_03]: It can become quite hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the scammers are extremely
personable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them are elders in the
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like you want to trust your
elders because that's how a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: are raised, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's people like, you know,
Tom Hill or Hempby or different people,
[SPEAKER_03]: where if you cross them the wrong way,
they're just going to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just going to write out a written
evisceration.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have a lot of patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a girl who went by the name
Weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, Matt, we talked about this,
but yeah, he was always giving Tom Hill a
[SPEAKER_02]: hard time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the early years that I was like 2012,
13, 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tom would just let it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when he came back, like you said,
he would just pound the guy, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was some thought that Weird was
actually a woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was very intelligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't just like saying you're a liar,
Tom, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he just wouldn't let go.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very much a bulldog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tom earned a new, he earned a new fan
the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just earned a new fan on Instagram the
other day that is convinced that he's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to prove that Tom's haze is a hybrid
somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another, another, another Don Chiodi there
tilting at windmills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times people in cannabis are
better with plants than they are with
[SPEAKER_03]: other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you start interacting.
[SPEAKER_03]: With other people, you know, and,
and it, you know, forums, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hard to stick to the facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: People get upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't like being called a liar.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't like being called this or
that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's people that just doubt or
they get, they read other stuff and they
[SPEAKER_03]: get their facts wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, the weird thing is like,
how long do you have to be online before
[SPEAKER_01]: you have your first experience that it's
like, Oh my God, something I was
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely positive was the truth is not
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because that happens with,
with, you know, pedigree provenance
[SPEAKER_01]: stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, and it, but it takes a while you
show up and you're, you're, you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're a virgin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You believe everything you've been told by
the marketing of every seed company ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watching, especially on cannabis world,
uh, where, uh, Sam skunk man was know it
[SPEAKER_03]: all for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, watching those arguments about skunk
one and Hayes go down, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're like, well, what do you believe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which people there's all these people that
are absolutely certain that this person's
[SPEAKER_03]: full of shit and this person's absolutely
certain that they weren't there and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're full of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people get defensive and da da da da
da.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would just go on and on and on and
on and on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know the story of white widow very
well, the two competing stories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, one of them is that,
let's see, there's a Brazilian sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a random AFI in there somewhere in
one of the stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the Kerala.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then it's, that's verner,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, or Ingmar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingmar or Shanti.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those two, both of them claim to be
the, the creator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I believe Shanti has a little bit
more detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: In his, in his description about how it
came to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is just kind of like,
well, I woke up one morning and I pissed
[SPEAKER_01]: out white widow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was, um, it was, it was a,
like a hash bean, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the, in Ingmar de Shaman story,
it was that a bean in a hash, if I
[SPEAKER_05]: remember correctly, there was something
called the plank, P L A N C K,
[SPEAKER_05]: some kind of Columbia or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it wasn't Columbia, something like
Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, and I think he did say Kerala as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe he traveled to India.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to get his as well, just like
Shanti did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they both magically came back with
this same exact, or not exact,
[SPEAKER_05]: but similar parentage hybrid with the same
exact name.
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience, the people in Amsterdam
tended to believe Ingmar and the people
[SPEAKER_03]: online tended to believe Shanti.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's definitely indisputable that
Shanti is the first person to release a
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line to the public using that name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the, and it does appear that the,
you know, all the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, and things like that,
that started dominating the cups,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the white widow and the, and the
great white shark and, and all that white
[SPEAKER_03]: wine, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, even like peacemaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace peacemaker is actually great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's Ingmar's.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ingmar's peacemaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Ingmar's peacemaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these guys all ripped each other
off and renamed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people trying to find a good
guy on that list is just, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, you know, I mean, I don't,
I don't, I don't condemn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't condemn them for it or anything,
but there's a lot of money involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there, you know, I remember,
cause I was a young kid, I was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I was a young adult then I'll
say, you know, barely, barely legal,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, getting those high times and they
would have these high glossy photos of all
[SPEAKER_03]: the winners in 95, 96, 97 and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd see the AK 47 and the white
widow and the right rhino and the great
[SPEAKER_03]: white shark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they won and they were like the best
weed out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, uh, those kinds of
strains started dominating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, they probably made milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably sold just umpteenth million
seats based off those spreads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people from America coming to
Holland, looking for those exact strains
[SPEAKER_03]: that they saw in high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a lot of monetary battling
going on over, you know, over access in
[SPEAKER_03]: that, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark marketing, the marketing legends
were, were the difference between,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, first and last.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I mean, I would, and he,
and even, even when we, if we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about the forums to trail it back to that
again, like the, I would say that the
[SPEAKER_03]: forums are really what made DJ short and
his blueberry work famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what made the original brothers grim
with the Cindy 99 and, uh, and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: very famous, you know, Vic highs worked
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, some of, some of the smaller breeders
that were just getting started,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, a good long 200 page thread on
something could spark a career on some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those early forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there wasn't that many people doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I remember looking at all that
blueberry work and being like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I never seen any weed that looks like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go spend a couple of thousand
dollars and then does it smell like fruit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it smell like it looks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does it look like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a time we've talked
about this on a previous podcast,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we, I used to go to these parties,
um, that were basically a gathering of a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of these people that had met online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your keys in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how the party went?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was a different podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not quite.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they, but everything when I was hoping
to find a bunch of like ancient varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: there and like everything was crossed with
blue work, white work, sweet tooth,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it was all those early two
thousands famous, you know, Breeder Steve,
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ short, um, you know, white widow,
white family, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause those were the big seeds of the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was also pre reversals and
pre-feminized work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was all kind of normal stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was hoping to find a bunch of
ancient stuff and it was all the most,
[SPEAKER_03]: at the time, the most modern, you know,
all the most modern lines, the new,
[SPEAKER_03]: new, the new, the at the time,
the hype, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the hype blue widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, you know, everything by
sweet two, three, um, everything by Louie,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, everything by a blockhead,
uh, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cindy 99, the first edition of,
of brothers Grimm when it was sly and Mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soul, those guys were very famous on the
early forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, then they disappeared and
it's like the demand for their seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: increased when they were no longer around,
which had that, that whole, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenon of, you know, creating a whole
bunch of new people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: making their F twos F threes of,
of Cindy 99 and discovering, holy crap,
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff breeds true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like the Dutch flowers group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they were some of the first people
that were, they would, they would write
[SPEAKER_03]: online, like what I consider now to be
like professional ad copy, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, of their strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was very, very well done and it was
designed to elicit emotions and feelings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would write extensively about how
amazing it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would do that for weeks or months
and get everybody hyped and tell them they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't have enough seed to give everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they would release their seed
online and it would sell out instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would do that every time.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the first, first, um,
seed sellers that were massive,
[SPEAKER_02]: like world of seeds where you could go on
there in great Britain and they had,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had every other seed company,
you know, they represented them just
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds and hundreds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember one of my first was seed
madness.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was real big from the UK was seed
madness.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had everyone remember heaven's
stairway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was, that was earlier before
the UK slam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that at the time,
but heaven's stairway was tied into both
[SPEAKER_03]: overgrown cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when they got rated, um,
both of those forums went down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I didn't realize it at the
time, but that was, that was the,
[SPEAKER_03]: that was the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all different facets of the same,
the same group, same group.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be interesting to talk to
Richard Calrissian now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, if he would, um, his name's well
known.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind saying it, you know,
the, the old owner of heaven's stairway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it would be very interesting to talk
to him because he would have a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: answers about Dutch flowers and a lot of
other companies that are very vague.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he worked with everyone the only
time I've ever got info on Dutch flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oddly enough was from Charles Scott,
reefer man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was who kind of gave me info on it,
but I don't want to repeat it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I don't even know if it's true
coming from him, but I will say that like
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch flowers, they would write this ad
copy and they would just write like
[SPEAKER_03]: descriptions of strains that went on and
on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time you were done reading it,
you were just ready to spend a thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars out of your pocket as soon as they
would let you to get as many of them as
[SPEAKER_03]: you could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'd sell out and you couldn't
get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there'd be people online laughing that
they got some and all stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like unbelievable how much they
were willing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were able to build momentum for each
seed drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they reminded me of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminded me of alien genetics when they
came out on the farm and like in 2011,
[SPEAKER_05]: 2012, 13, like it is just like every drop
they did was just like a thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_05]: a pack, $2,000 a pack every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And nobody knew who they were,
but nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's really expensive and
there's not enough for everyone,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we're going to drop it at this time
and you can all fight over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would really, and it was like,
it's a, it's a cool way of like how human
[SPEAKER_03]: nature works.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hear something that's rare and
desirable and you see other people posting
[SPEAKER_03]: about how bad they want it and you want
it, it's only going to be there for a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're just like, take my money,
please.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really clever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbie's head shop advertised as the
largest UK cannabis seed bank back then
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at a list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all these bookmarks in my Firefox
and some of these hypersamias in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought some from, in one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You bought a bunch from them and they
didn't pop, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hypersamias.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I got my first packet came with a
footprint on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these people were nice enough to,
I didn't even have a way of making a
[SPEAKER_02]: digital photo to send to them,
but they, they believed me and they sent
[SPEAKER_02]: it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got them, but someone in the post
office, you know, just you can tell,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can tell that Herbie's a good guy from
that picture of them on their ads with the
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadlocks and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was real cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got, that's gotta be Herbie,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and then, then you had these
people who wrote these legend stories,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like the origin of skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like a novel, you know,
it's like a short, it's like a short
[SPEAKER_01]: fiction book seeds did them since he seeds
had great long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, I remember, I remember
Jesse's pretty well for Mr. Knight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought Jesse wrote those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is the sensey ones are
almost identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which made me think, Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was he actually working for both,
both sides of the battle?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, wouldn't that be funny?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you remember Jesse, Jesse posted fake
pictures of UK cheese as the head picture
[SPEAKER_05]: for UK cheese too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the little quiz show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I always get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always say it's white skunk,
but it's like white skunk one something
[SPEAKER_05]: rather, but yeah, white widow cheese or
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a whole series on Mr. Nice where he
would come out with a lot, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: original strains and these extremely long
and detailed stories told with utter
[SPEAKER_03]: confidence about where they came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, it, it, uh,
you know, it's, uh, sometimes they say
[SPEAKER_03]: like in news, it's better to be first than
to be right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that is the case online as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your tail out there, um, and,
and, and, and get repetition going on and
[SPEAKER_03]: defend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually it'll burrow in and
become part of the fabric of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Candice earworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then some people on,
uh, on your podcast will invite you on to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain how that story doesn't make any
sense anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, what's funny is one of
the decisions that Matt and I made about
[SPEAKER_03]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason we started talking about
old stuff from the seventies and eighties
[SPEAKER_03]: first was because there was less people
that were going to get super offended and
[SPEAKER_03]: fight with us instantly about telling what
we know, because it goes against what
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits them or they're making money on
some angle on it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's a, there's very, there's only
so many people that are actually
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are interested in making
themselves look good and making money.
[SPEAKER_05]: CSI often reminds me that we are weirdos
because we actually give a shit about
[SPEAKER_05]: what's in our weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we are the, we are the actual weirdos
that care enough to archive, to really
[SPEAKER_05]: delve into what's in strains and then
what's in those parents and what that's
[SPEAKER_05]: weirdo people stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're those people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he reminds me all the time,
Matt, not everybody cares like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird that we care like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it keeps some perspective, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a minority, a dying minority that are
genuinely interested in strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be growing minority, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it have to be a dying minority?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I really, no, I, I'll disagree on
that one strongly because I use this
[SPEAKER_03]: analogy all the time, but like,
I kind of think cannabis right now is
[SPEAKER_03]: where like wine was in the seventies,
where it's like, people know for the most
[SPEAKER_03]: part, they know about white and red.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they know about red is red goes
with like pot roast and it's like deeper
[SPEAKER_03]: and like men drink it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And white wine goes with fish or it's like
your lady likes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as like, it's not as robust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's really what people knew
mostly about wine in the seventies,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you fast forward with 30 or 40
years of education and people are talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about, I like my Cabernet Sauvignon from
this Appalachian in Napa or this part of
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino County, or I like it from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys that make wine,
these Vintners are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so much depth now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have like sommeliers that come to
the table at fancy restaurants and explain
[SPEAKER_03]: the nuances of these expensive bottles
they want you to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think cannabis will go in that
direction for some percentage of the
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a great desire for
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, we're in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now people are fighting over the
history, you know, because it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: become more important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are going to want marketing
stories too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to want to sell their
version of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Market trends.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything you just said sounds right
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question would be, is that percentage
that are connoisseurs that are willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend the extra for the good stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you compare it to the alcohol business
model, the majority of people are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy the cheap beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the best bang for the buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people like to get the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drink in moderation and savor it and
make a big deal out of it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: except there's so much, cannabis and
alcohol aren't the same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you drink a gallon of one kind,
you drink a gallon of the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be just as dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, but you know, with cannabis,
the differences are so great between one
[SPEAKER_01]: strain or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's not exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not like 10, 10 hits of bad
weed is not the same as one good hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, and even if it's just a small
percentage that's interested in what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in, that has the potential to
still be millions of people spread out
[SPEAKER_03]: over, over, you know, a wide area of
humans, you know, that's where those
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is by the general increase in number of
people who smoke in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the 20%, if we're going to
think that 20% are ever going to give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit about, about quality, um,
you know, then that, that number,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do we grow that number of 20% so that,
you know, an army of, of old school Hill
[SPEAKER_01]: Hill, you know, boys from the Hill can
keep making a living off of their special,
[SPEAKER_01]: their special stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have thoughts on that too, because
coming from like being like a grateful
[SPEAKER_03]: dead hippie when I was young and all that,
like when I was younger, the only place
[SPEAKER_03]: you could get organic food was basically
like crunchy co-ops and odd places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'd like to say that it was like
us that pushed it forward, but we really
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't who really pushed it forward was
like, there was some yuppies and some
[SPEAKER_03]: wealthier people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, you know, I drive a
European sports car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wear these really nice shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wear tailored suits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't I have a nicer grade of food?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, and, and there's going to
be a whole group of people that get into
[SPEAKER_03]: it and they're going to want a nicer grade
because everything else they have in life
[SPEAKER_03]: is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's just how, you know,
they have nice wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have nice shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have nice belts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a nice car.
[SPEAKER_03]: They live in a nice zip code, you know,
uh, all those different types of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, some percentage of them are
going to get interested in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to want high grade cannabis
because they get high grade everything.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's why they're the
reason why you can go into any grocery
[SPEAKER_03]: store these days and had there's at least
a small organic section, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and plus, you know, one difference
between food and cannabis is food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food would be described as an essential,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have it to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is, is not, um, necessarily,
unless you use it for medicine that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but again, you know, you don't need
Italian leather shoes to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a lot of people buy them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, well, and if they don't fit,
you have to acquit also those Bruno,
[SPEAKER_01]: Molly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of my price range.
[SPEAKER_03]: This might have to get edited,
but Matt, I have to bail in a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're, we're good right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have about an hour and a half in,
and I know Raho's got a bill soon too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's, uh, let's record.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some kind of exit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so if we're going to record an exit,
uh, I will just say that the forums were
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing because they were the first time
that worldwide cannabis enthusiasts got to
[SPEAKER_03]: insult each other, share information,
throw poop at each other, fight about what
[SPEAKER_03]: the truth was and share their personal
stories outside their own little friend
[SPEAKER_03]: group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for good and bad, it totally changed
how cannabis people interacted with each
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made a bunch of friendships.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made some enemies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned something from very local for
most people into nation or even
[SPEAKER_03]: internationally wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It forged a bunch of friendships over a
long period of time of people that met
[SPEAKER_03]: through forums and, and direct messages
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so technology combined with loosening
laws in America that made people feel
[SPEAKER_03]: slightly more comfortable to get on and
talk about things is really what sprung
[SPEAKER_03]: forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, uh, a lot of information
exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I don't think any of the four
people on here talking today would be
[SPEAKER_03]: talking without that internet advancement
for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're, we, we've met each
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: All four of us, you know, so I say that,
you know, that, that change was a sea
[SPEAKER_03]: change because it brought together a lot
of disparate groups of weed enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_03]: and allowed them to make friends or argue
or both or whatever, and push information
[SPEAKER_03]: and history forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's, uh, it's been a massive
positive in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the massive number of new strains,
hybrids really was fostered on forums,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, where people exchange seeds and
sent you a private message and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I've got these and you've got those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then next thing, you know,
they're being crossed with another one and
[SPEAKER_02]: proliferating crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also, one thing I should say too,
that made me think of it when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking is that it used to be before the
forums and before the internet,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it was only a very few number of seed
banks, seed companies that were allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: sell stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the forums came about,
a lot of private hobbyist breeders started
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to exchange their work with
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Madjag said, that was revolutionary
and push forward hybrids in a way that no
[SPEAKER_03]: one expected, because it went forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: From a few dozen companies to literally
thousands of people exchanging their work
[SPEAKER_03]: with each other of their own private
projects and, and getting famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people got famous, but even if
they didn't, it just spread the germ,
[SPEAKER_03]: the germ plasm around all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam and Rob Clark both told me that the
only, when I was asking them at a later
[SPEAKER_02]: date, the only seed company or seed bank
that they felt was legit was seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seedsman in Amsterdam, Seedsman just for
whatever it's worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've sold a lot of stuff through
Seedsman and they are one of the more,
[SPEAKER_01]: more legit houses out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that the internet
allowed us to grow the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not so you were a dead head,
you know, went out on tour, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bought whatever you bought on shakedown
street and got friends probably still from
[SPEAKER_01]: those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I never was a dead head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I liked their music,
but I never went and saw them on tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I hate that I missed that,
but you know, it seems like with Jerry
[SPEAKER_01]: gone and that we all know that that,
that movement that served the function of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of propagating and preserving genetics,
you know, people brought their best to the
[SPEAKER_01]: show because they wanted to show off to
their friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, it wasn't just to
make money to get to the next show or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, there was pride
associated with that and competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: When those, when those events stopped,
you know, I guess, I guess the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of took its place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, and it took it to
places like way beyond we could have ever
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten to in those parking lots and cell
phone numbers or, you know, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: however the old connections were
maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay phones and beepers, you know,
this summer will be 25 years that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: lived in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I absolutely would not live here if
dead head friends that I knew from,
[SPEAKER_03]: from shows and tour had not lived here and
invited me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's, you know, the health,
the health of the community as it exists
[SPEAKER_01]: today is because of forms, you know,
and, and I like to differentiate between
[SPEAKER_01]: community and industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the community is all the people
that kept this stuff alive when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and getting caught could be the
end of, you know, ruin your life
[SPEAKER_01]: literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all those people who,
who did the work when, when the,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the, the, the consequences were so
grave, you know, those people are part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the community and the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all know what the industry is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's, it's the big
business that that hopes to get rich off
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of, of that legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm not, I got nothing
against big business, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's, it seems that the two,
the community and the type of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: the community has, has worked towards and
values is, is in a collision course or in
[SPEAKER_01]: direct conflict with the industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That the, the industry is all about money
and that, that drives, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: production practices weighed in a way down
in a negative way for quality
[SPEAKER_01]: standardization, everything turns
everything homogenization, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the same mediocre crap everywhere
you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm, I'm all about the community
versus industry and the communities
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be here without the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Art, art and economics have always been
uncomfortable bedfellows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a quote or did you just make off
the top of your head?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, it's definitely not me,
but I just spun it off the top of my head,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got anything you want to get in
for this week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mad Jag, is your mustache bigger?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's handsome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a handsome mustache.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shaved my beard off a few episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you look much older and I am much
older.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes me much, much older.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be an episode coming up where
the beard leaves and it's, it's him and I
[SPEAKER_03]: with full stashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Handle our stashes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to do mine just into a mustache.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had one, just mustaches ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as you guys know, I've got a
full mustache right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I know, you are an apparition.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a specter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a ghost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Disembodied voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Disembodied voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everyone always super appreciate
everyone listening and everyone's time and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't end the show yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mad Jag, what was your partner's friend
again?
[SPEAKER_05]: His name?
[SPEAKER_02]: John Slater.
[SPEAKER_05]: John Slater.
[SPEAKER_05]: J-O-N.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: S-L-A-T-O-R.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called You're the Mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody checking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a whole, an IC mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a whole thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see it and read a chapter and
the rest of it, you can get very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's not going to hard copy,
publish it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's working on a second one right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be more real, like a
biography.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was like I was connected
with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, I just started
questioning everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the time, by the time I got
high, that very first time when it started
[SPEAKER_01]: to hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got high.
I got high.
