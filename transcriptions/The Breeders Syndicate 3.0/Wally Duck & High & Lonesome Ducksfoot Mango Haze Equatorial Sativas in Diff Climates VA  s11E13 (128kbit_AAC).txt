[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew here with my co-host,
Thousandfold, and today we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: having a few special guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is a brother of mine,
Haiyan Lonesome, who most people know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on the show before, and he's a
part of our crew and just one of our best
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Buzi, would you introduce our other
guests, please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Other esteemed guests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitting here with a bloke that needs a
little introduction is our mate,
[SPEAKER_03]: Wally Duck, another Aussie legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done a little show before,
so thought we'd get him on and delve a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: deeper into his history in the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of my favorite blokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides being a guy to go to about info,
like a mentor, he's a good mate as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: so happy to have Wally here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pleased to have both of these guys on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to get Haiyan Lonesome on,
I'll say that, and I'm going to pat myself
[SPEAKER_04]: on the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, it's actually Buzi.
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole thing was actually Buzi's idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should give Buzi credit for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought as a little icebreaker,
maybe Wally could just talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: about how he got started and then same
Haiyan Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to point out that Haiyan Lonesome
does have his own episode from like maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: a year ago, but we'll get him to,
you know, tell us a bit more again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, Wally, tell us how you got
started to begin with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like started smoking weed, you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, growing, smoking, any of it,
yeah, wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there was a brother-in-law actually,
and I was pretty young.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a real stoner, and I was just
sitting with him in the lounge.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's passed a joint to me, some tie stick
in a joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he loved getting people high,
and it took me a lot though, like two
[SPEAKER_06]: joints, and he was like sick of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, giving his weed away at that
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still wasn't high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to kind of like get up, and I went
into another room, and when I stepped down
[SPEAKER_06]: into the next room, it just hit me all at
once, and like complete euphoria,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I never looked back after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fantastic, I thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, he was part of me growing too,
because his friend had a property,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we couldn't get tie sticks anymore,
so we thought we'd grow our own stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was about 14 or 15 at that point,
and we grew a fair bit of weed,
[SPEAKER_06]: actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was the only one of my crew,
we were just young, and we had like pounds
[SPEAKER_06]: of weed, and everyone else was still
scratching around for a few grams,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: What part of Oz were you living in at the
time, brother?
[SPEAKER_06]: Melbourne.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm from Melbourne, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you getting ties to finish down
there, like were you starting them
[SPEAKER_03]: indoors, or depping them, or?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there was no indoors back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just waited forever and ever,
and it was all just bag seed we grew.
[SPEAKER_06]: What year was this, Wally?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like roughly?
[SPEAKER_06]: What period was this?
[SPEAKER_06]: 82, 83, something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, it would be 83.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was after like, we had Ash Wednesday,
do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe you'd be young.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bushfires, a bit young, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's before my time as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was just after that, and all the
scrub had been burnt, so there was lots of
[SPEAKER_06]: open ground at my friend's place,
so we all stuck some weed up in the
[SPEAKER_06]: mountain there, and some of it took
forever to finish.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hermaphrodites and all sorts of crazy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of big purple plants too,
and yeah, it wasn't until, it was into
[SPEAKER_06]: winter where most of these things were
finishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the import scene like at that
time?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only got a little bit of experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I started smoking about 20,
oh, nah, 2011, something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by that time, it was just Bush and
Hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you're saying, you had Ty,
and I know your mate's dad used to get
[SPEAKER_03]: Indonesian and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What other stuff was around at the time
that was coming in as import?
[SPEAKER_06]: We mostly got Ty, and we got Hash too,
though, a fair bit of Hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: All different sorts of Hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who imported it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there was large imports in
containers and that, but I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: the smaller stuff was just, customs
weren't as strict back then, and people
[SPEAKER_06]: being able to bring it with them,
as far as I could work out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, we had Lebanese gold,
and the larger import was, I think it was
[SPEAKER_06]: Mujahideen Hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all this gold stamp, black Hash,
squishy sort of stuff, spongy,
[SPEAKER_06]: wrapped in red cellophane.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we mostly only got Ty, where I was,
in Melbourne there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we got the stuff on sticks for quite a
while, and then we got loose stuff in
[SPEAKER_06]: bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Golden buds, golden Ty, golden Buddha,
they called it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think that was the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever get into that Ty stick book,
that off which of the smugglers over in
[SPEAKER_06]: this- Yeah, and I've also got those guys,
they have a little group on Facebook as
[SPEAKER_06]: well, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them runs it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a fair bit of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was based in that, one of the areas
where I like to go, in Udon Tarni.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems to be one of the places that
was pretty famous for the Ty sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hain Lonson, you want to tell us a bit
about how you got started in your journey?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I started pretty young,
as I have noted before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, soon after I started smoking,
I come from a farming family, and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, man, we can grow this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were getting a lot of brickweed,
a lot of Mexican weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Occasionally you get it from somewhere a
little more exotic, Columbia or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, it was Mexican
weed, very low quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Green sometimes, but a lot of it brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did the trick, but it wasn't
pleasurable to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Started trying to cross over some of my
vegetable growing techniques to weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it worked out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got started growing bag seeds,
and they finished pretty well in Virginia,
[SPEAKER_05]: where I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can usually get them done right around
the first frost, but they're area plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have the density you have with a
lot of these modern lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get them done without getting too
much mold or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, started from there, then I moved
on to growing Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Outdoor, that's a whole different ball
game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, those skunk one types, northern
light types, you have issues with mold
[SPEAKER_05]: just because of density.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me a few years to realize that I
was better off growing thin leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties, more open plants, looser bud
structure, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I fucked up plenty while I
learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got you growing in Virginia,
and obviously Wally growing in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any overlap in the climate at all
in where you guys are?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wally was a huge inspiration to me on
Overgrow and ICMag.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to look at his gorilla pictures,
his fields out in the bush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like, man, I want to do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, completely different environment
to try to do it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tobacco in Virginia?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, tobacco, corn, soybeans,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of the mass production farming
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a good climate for tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the traditional crops,
the problem here is the humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have such high humidity, especially
later in the summer and the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of tricky.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to work at it to make it happen
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just when you don't want it around
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, can I ask?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can ask you both, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were some of the first plants or
lines that you grew that you noticed
[SPEAKER_04]: actually did exceptionally well in the
area?
[SPEAKER_06]: In my specific area, you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tibers do really well, but we had the
same problem as H&L where at the end of
[SPEAKER_06]: the season here, because we're close to
the coast, we get that rain and the
[SPEAKER_06]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I opted for growing in our dry
season because the hours are still,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the days aren't very long still.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just anything that would finish at
that time of year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how I ended up with growing
C99, actually, because that thing did
[SPEAKER_06]: really well here in that time of year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It produced a fair amount of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The weed was really good quality and it
didn't revege, you know, with the hours
[SPEAKER_06]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was my, so that's why I made lots
of crosses with C99.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually, I was not intent on making
seed for sale.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually seeds to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then excess would end up, you know,
I'd sent a gypsy or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, mate, how did you select your C99
mate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, were you breeding it for the
conditions up there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like obviously C99 had a pretty
bloody good run, but I've spoken to a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like people that are, you know,
big into haze and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them rate your C99 stuff as
some of the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if that's because you were
breeding it for like a particular effect
[SPEAKER_03]: or if it was strictly because you were in
that climate, you were likely selecting
[SPEAKER_03]: more towards the hazy types or what was
the breeding like on that one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe a bit of both, but the
pineapple, eh?
[SPEAKER_06]: The pineapple was what I was chasing
because the rest of it, it was okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I found a pineapple, it was
really, you know, it's all nice smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And good looking bud, but the pineapple
was just strikes ahead of the other stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what I was chasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pineapple weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pineapple, the C99 pineapple was
always one of my favorite expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was above and beyond, especially
flavor-wise to be able to smell that in
[SPEAKER_01]: weed was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have a few, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, you know, like I said, I started
with Mexican bag seed that did pretty well
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never had major mold issues,
you know, a spot here or there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then as I kind of started looking at more
magazines, looking online, I decided to
[SPEAKER_05]: order some seeds and give it a go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started with some cheaper stuff,
some Nirvana stuff, Casey Brain stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried quite a few things and realized
pretty quickly that it was not suited to
[SPEAKER_05]: my environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a few that were, Durban poison
did well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern Lights haze from Nirvana did
well, but it wasn't like a NL5 haze,
[SPEAKER_05]: like an A5 or a C5.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had some skunk one or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was much quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then what really started killing it for me
outside was Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one that really got me,
you know, feeling like I could do
[SPEAKER_05]: something nice out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it was definitely
phenospecific.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some of the longer ones you
couldn't finish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the like eight or nine weekers,
you know, you could get them done.
[SPEAKER_05]: But towards the end, you'd start to see
some issues, some issues with rot just
[SPEAKER_05]: because of the density of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we had a cut that we kept around that
was a really good outdoor cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I'm pretty hard headed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still try all kinds of stuff outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still try above outdoor every few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you can't consistently get
it done well here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, that's why I favor stuff
like Super Silver Haze outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Appalachian line I did and some of
those hybrids do well outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few cuts that do really well
outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shoreline probably being one of the best
for here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it gets done in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's normally October 10th.
[SPEAKER_05]: October 15th, somewhere in there,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it misses that kind of cool down and
the heavier rain season.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, man, I'm just always trying new
stuff, always seeing what works.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do love doing haze hybrids outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't pull off pure haze here,
but haze hybrids are kind of where it's at
[SPEAKER_05]: for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one question about the Appalachia
real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have even touched on it the first
time we spoke to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the first time, sorry, in your episode
last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I think of like a Chem D type,
I don't think of a region or a climate
[SPEAKER_04]: like the one you were describing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it take much work to get the Appi to
kind of, you know, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: be OK in that environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like between like, you know, the Tresdog
and the Green Crackers, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_04]: those don't sound like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So of the Chem cuts that I've grown
outdoor here, Chem D does the best for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Chem 4 is bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem 91 is just a no go.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just melt away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem D does pretty well, especially if you
can, you know, keep it dry towards the
[SPEAKER_05]: end.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done hilarious things over the years
to keep, you know, the October rains off
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Green Crack was great because it was
always done so early.
[SPEAKER_05]: It triggers really early here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it'll trigger in July in
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can get that plant, you know,
harvested before October.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know, I wanted to cross the two to
try to get something like Green Crack with
[SPEAKER_05]: a little more potency that kind of did
double duty indoor and outdoor here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Appalachia is definitely quicker than
Chem D.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it helps there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just just a matter of trying to get
it done before October, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first or second week of October.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might even try one of your hybrids over
our summer here later on just to see how
[SPEAKER_04]: it how it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it pretty dry there?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably like 60, 70.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you could.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could handle that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talking indoors thousand or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's still indoors, but I still have
to worry about it because.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you were talking about
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty it's pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an easy plant, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boaz, you had you you listed a few
different lines or cuts that we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: ask Wally about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man, I had a few things down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously the first one, probably the
one that you're most known for besides the
[SPEAKER_03]: C99 was the golden pineapple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember seeing that in the Canter Bible
three.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the breeding like on that and
what was the plant like in general?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how that even got in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know someone, you know,
years down the track said, oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was just I just had some gypsies
to send me seeds all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a bunch of skush,
whatever lines that that guy was his name.
The.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weasel guy flying, flying Dutchman or
mongoose mongoose.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he made or released those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The weasel guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to keep away from that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I just put some in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And seriously, that was just like it was a
plant that was there at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it copped some pollen and it was
nothing intentional with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently it came out quite good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and I grew a bunch of it, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But and I just shared some with a bunch of
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how that must have happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there was a cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone kept around for quite a while from
that as well, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that still is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw something pop up on the can of
cabana recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw someone had some golden pineapple
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were raving about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we get just the time,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I'll see if we can get some seeds,
kick him over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think fucking Professor P messes with a
golden pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's the same exact one,
but over the years, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some pineapple field stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might kick me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if I had seen 99 in it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a pineapple at some point,
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know whose it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember, but it was pineapple
skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone had some pineapple somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one was the double sour zammel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zammel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the double sour zammel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard you speak about that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounded like a bloody interest in
outdoor hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that East Coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff is awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've grown some of H&Ls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got something now of the Appalachia
that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: East Coast sour diesel cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was going to be pretty good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the zammel, I got that from,
what was his name?
[SPEAKER_06]: Purple flowers, purple rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the guys on Overgrow, on ICMAG,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just sent me all this sativa stuff just
out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want this stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, I'll have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amongst it was a zammel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was gypsy zammel originally,
but I think it was a couple of generations
[SPEAKER_06]: along.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that stuff was a beast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd known about it for a while,
but everyone said it had a carrot smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never liked that carrot-smelling weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did smell carrot-y initially,
but then it ended up with this tea tree
[SPEAKER_06]: oil, pretty strong aroma.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really strong weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really surprised.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like that creeper weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't grow upwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd get a couple of feet high and then
it'd just splay down, fall over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had this massive bush of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kept that cutting for quite a while,
and that's what I used for the initial
[SPEAKER_06]: sour zammel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I just crossed it to sour diesel
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've grown a bit, and some other guys I
know have done that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know Bin Chicken?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Bin Chicken?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we had him on the show.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's used it in one of his... What's that
thing he's got with the... Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: Duluga.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that he's working with,
for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a fairly long... ABC, sour zammel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we chat a bit, and we do a bit of
swapping backward and forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he really liked it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He liked a fair bit of the stuff I was
sending him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you all get the East Coast sour diesel
clone down there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we got it off... If I can try and
remember his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Santero?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sent a couple of things down.
[SPEAKER_06]: East Coast sour diesel, C5.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we got the C5 from,
and Stardog too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm impressed that they made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how they got here,
but they're not only good here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to keep that one as long as I
could.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kept the sour diesel, and it wasn't
until recently that that ended,
[SPEAKER_06]: because I had it with a friend,
and he shared it with another friend of
[SPEAKER_06]: mine, because it wasn't suitable for him,
thinking my other friend would keep it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but he never did.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how that goes, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharing's good, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way, you might run out of it,
and old mates got it over there,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it doesn't always work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sour Xamalid boys... Oh, sorry,
Thousand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say quickly,
the Sour Xamalid boys interested me,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I've got this thing for sours and
OGs paired with these sativas,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's this modern, uber potent
plant that isn't a cambium.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a little bit of sativa in it,
these cushions and these sours,
[SPEAKER_03]: so paired with a crazy sativa,
I'm interested to see what they do
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a lot of hope for the LA Cush and
the sour diesel by the mango haze that H&L
[SPEAKER_03]: did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got 40 of each of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do a big pop and try and find
something interesting for outdoor,
[SPEAKER_03]: because people always said that diesels do
well outdoors, so I'll be able to find
[SPEAKER_03]: something for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a really big one outside right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always does well here for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get a few issues, but the last few
years, I've been doing them in a
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse, and I'm depping some now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a killer cut, and it pairs well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the way it pairs up with sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm finishing up a couple of plants now.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mate Sonny, Southern Sunseeds,
is another Aussie breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had the sour cologne as well,
so I'm growing East Coast mullum tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sour Cush mullum tie, crossed to a
Kemi Cush mullum tie that he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not a fucking speck of mold on
them, and they got these stubby colas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty fantastic and stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a nothing observation,
but I just wanted to point out that it
[SPEAKER_04]: seems like Wally's got pineapple,
and H&L has a lot of mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like mango.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of pretty boys in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, go H&L.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say, I think a lot
more stuff is mango than some of our
[SPEAKER_05]: friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our buddy Local has said some of these
things are a little more cut white grapes,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is pretty specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: After he said that, I noticed it in some
of the EV, Appalachia stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be a little white gravy,
but mango.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still get a lot of mango from
Appalachia, Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mango haze was surprisingly mango on
some of the Finos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't suffer from mango.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if mango resists mold for you
there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think so?
[SPEAKER_05]: It could.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something I've always wanted to
dive a little more deep into, but I
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't because I've always heard that
terpenolene resists mold, which makes
[SPEAKER_05]: sense to me in some of the sativas,
but then trainwreck here, if you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: take it early, molds pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty terpenolene dominant
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something I've always wanted to dig
into, but I haven't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been growing mids this whole time
instead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if Saws of the Brack does
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I reckon it probably would.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Saws of the Brack has heaps to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at that shoreline, it's pretty
dense, but those Bracks look quite small
[SPEAKER_03]: in comparison to Green Crack or trainwreck
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same as with mullum tie, it's relatively
small Bracks, but very dense flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if it's just the Brack itself
that will rot and then start to rot the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower out with fortress.
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say because Sauer can have
pretty large Bracks.
[SPEAKER_05]: That does better than if you tried to take
Green Crack to the end of October.
[SPEAKER_05]: That just wouldn't work here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get it at the beginning of
October, but you're not going to get it at
[SPEAKER_05]: Halloween.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be just melted away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, the thing that I've noticed with a
lot of people, talking to a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: over the last few years is you just have
to have that plant rock solid going in the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to stay on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get something Seporia Leaf Spot here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see it in pictures of plants all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get something like that in a plant,
something fungal like that, it just
[SPEAKER_05]: weakens the plant so much that it's
susceptible to everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to keep my plants well-fed,
plenty of calcium, and I spray a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't spray a flower, but here it's just
trying to keep the plant as healthy as you
[SPEAKER_05]: can going in, and you'll see way less
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cal Mag maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this Mongtai?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk some about it, who it came
from, the smell, flavor, effect,
growth?
[SPEAKER_06]: It did come from Prof 70.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Prof sent it to Bushy,
and then Bushy sent it to me, something
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bushy knew more about the bong part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but as far as I remember,
Prof's wife, I did meet them all,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Prof's wife, biggest smoker ever,
real bong head, that lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like sitting in the bathroom all day
smoking bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, she loved it.
[SPEAKER_06]: She couldn't go anywhere without a bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went away for a couple of days,
and she had to make up like an orgy bottle
[SPEAKER_06]: bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her dad was a smoker, and I think the
Mongtai came from bag seed from him.
[SPEAKER_06]: We initially thought he was a grower,
but I don't think he was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he was just a toker, and they knew
Mong people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met some Mong people with them,
the Hill tribe people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's where that stuff came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew some out in the jungle there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone says that thai can really handle
rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't like wet roots much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It died.
[SPEAKER_06]: Several of them died.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in an area where it was still on a
bit of a slope, but it was at the bottom
[SPEAKER_06]: of a slope.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got wet feet for just too long,
and several of them died.
[SPEAKER_06]: The higher ones went all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nice weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone that I gave some to rated it as
the best that they'd gotten off me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd gotten a fair bit of what I thought
was good weed, but they seriously liked
[SPEAKER_06]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It obviously had a fair bit of potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came through Bushy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to ask you about that,
because I'd seen that Kanga was growing
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've seen that Marijuana
Australiana documentary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the huge plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, oh, no, I think that was the O
'Harkin mango haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he put a Mongtai in the lake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have gone 20 meters or something,
but it only got to seven or 11 or
[SPEAKER_03]: something this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder, because Bushy had it,
if it was one of the ones that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: using when they were doing the outback.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got it through Bushy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might have even sent some back
to him because he ran out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was always a bit of, you know,
to and fro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever grow a hippie's tie or see it
or no?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no one can have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not a sharing man, that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not very literate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had some problems with that fellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be like the last guy on Earth he'd
ever share anything with, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd be second to last, I would
guarantee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a random, random question here,
which is, have you spent much time in that
[SPEAKER_04]: part of Southeast Asia, Wally,
yourself, just like to visit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been to heaps, probably a dozen
times at least to Thailand and around and
[SPEAKER_06]: around too, like, you know, Northeast,
West, South, and mostly in the Northeast
[SPEAKER_06]: where they used to grow the tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I married a woman from there,
from the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Issan, the area in the
Northeast there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each section of Thailand's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the cultures and the food and
even the languages vary a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the Issan area there, they eat some
crazy stuff like frogs and bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frogs are pretty good, I have to say,
having tried frog before.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of poultry.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, for real.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like chicken, like small chicken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, frog legs are pretty good,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just guessed something fucking
weird out here, not eating frogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of meat on those legs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're missing out, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super spicy food, no?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a whole, I think Booz has
a whole bunch of questions about Thailand,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we'll save for later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: HNO, have you spent much time in Southeast
Asia, like just even as a tourist or?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't get out much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of obligations that keep me
around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, unfortunately, I have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think before I make it over there,
I'll probably try to get to Australia,
[SPEAKER_05]: hang out with these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be rolling out right now about
each island.
[SPEAKER_03]: One night in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll take a special trip there
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, going back to what Wally was
saying, though, the food is amazing and
[SPEAKER_04]: like so cheap as well for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking amazing food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do love tag.
Booz?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you traveled to Southeast Asia?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, I've been to Bali, bro, like every
other Australian.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the Northeast island of
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's about it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fiji.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of my travel in Europe, so Amsterdam
a bunch and then Germany and Switzerland
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I'd love to get over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nepal would probably be where I'd head
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually talking to a mate looking
at the Zomia trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got some trips up on their
website, like a TBD at the moment,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're looking at going to like South
America, Morocco and then places like
[SPEAKER_03]: Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got an aunt that's Cambodian and
an uncle that lived there for about 10
[SPEAKER_03]: years or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd probably look to head over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's still some fantastic
Cambodian land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's even this guy that's like popped
up over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's the ex-pat that's selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it could be a cool little
venture.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go any further, Wally,
let's talk ducksfoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first I knew about you when I hit
you up way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wally and his ducksfoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Wally Duck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of misconceptions even
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go online and you hear people talk
about ducksfoot, they'll refer to it as
[SPEAKER_01]: like instead of a strain or something that
you work, they'll refer to it as like a
[SPEAKER_01]: trait that goes through cookies or through
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about it,
where you found it, what you found working
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a little lowdown on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we got it lively here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be honest, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: The origin, but it's just a trait that can
be in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the origin doesn't have to be specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to have been from Hawaii
or Africa or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a guy that I knew that I grew some
weed with, he talked to me a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: about it, but he just said he knew a guy
that had some stuff that had like three
[SPEAKER_06]: fingers leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, look, I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he said, oh, this is good weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he said the guy wouldn't give him any.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then so we had to wait till the guy
was desperate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he said, he's given us like a box
of plants or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And old mates made some seed out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he and I grew some.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we actually only had one ducksfoot
plant, I think we had.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we crossed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, that's shit stunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was skunky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing I could liken it to.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the same smell as skunk,
but just how it permeated, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the distance you could smell it from.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, it was a nice weed,
a little bit of hashy sort of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the taste, you get on your lips and
you could lick your lips and taste it
[SPEAKER_06]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: And smile to happy, happy, happy weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So so we kept around.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I kind of didn't know what I was doing
back then making seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a bit of a hit and a miss
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't do that well on the first
recreation of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I couldn't go back because I lost
seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the guy that that I got to hold on to
the stash, he gave him away to his ex
[SPEAKER_06]: girlfriend's new guy, which I thought,
fuck, who even gives you anything,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, the the best out of the seed
we had, there was, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe it was 50% web leaf stuff and 50%
just the normal cannabis leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the normal stuff was the better stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would have used that to,
you know, bring back the taste and the
smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and then I lost most of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I got some stuff off a Hawaiian dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: We spoke together and it seemed like his
stuff, the stuff, what I had, had all the
[SPEAKER_06]: advantages that he wanted and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we swapped.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was that Hawaiian Web Indigo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it grew short, like about three or
four foot, had one main color,
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't want to branch out, huge stem,
huge, big hollow stem on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my idea, I thought it was definitely
Indigo, whereas my stuff was tall,
[SPEAKER_06]: branchy, you know, flowered longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I, this wasn't a pure sativa,
that duck's foot, but it was definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: sativa dominant, you know, versus that
Indigo.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I made a cross of the two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: The strongest smelling weed I've ever come
across.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just stank.
[SPEAKER_06]: And but like petroleum, you know,
like, yeah, that's why I thought when I
[SPEAKER_06]: when I was growing, and the people start
talking about diesel, and I'm smelling
[SPEAKER_06]: this stuff and thinking, wow, must be like
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was even this is even stronger
than that, that diesel smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't make me nauseous pruning it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pruned like an ounce or two,
and I'd have to stop and and go away from
[SPEAKER_06]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just that bad.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad in a good way, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I actually got some back from a dude
recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just I've just planted some this
guy on on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he showed me a showed me a photo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said his old man got this stuff in
blah, blah year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he lives in, you know, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just down the road from me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was on that webbed webbed hybrid at
the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and I asked him to does it stink like
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, Oh, yeah, it's it stinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it's the same one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember seeing a bloke growing ducks
foot widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not even that long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: North side of Brisbane in fucking 2018
2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had a duck's foot widow in his
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was doing the leaf thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was getting into the seed stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was only just started growing five years
back or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at that time, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I wonder if it's still around in
any form, even locally, or if even this is
[SPEAKER_03]: might be the same bloke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He sells seeds, this guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The seed packets I got from him,
they look like a saleable item.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm pretty sure he sells seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I wanted to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I when I got interested in the ducks,
but what I wanted to do at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like silly looking back,
but I wanted to make an auto flower that
[SPEAKER_01]: was like kind of, you know, under the
radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the problem was that it stunk
so fucking bad that if you grew it
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors, even if you can a little bit
with the web leaf trait, there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: mistaking the smell when the sun hit in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're just not not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't really stealthy per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was not not in that regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't one of the Dutch companies do an
auto duck not too long ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there was like a Friesian duck
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they did an auto version of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always wondered if that was from Wild
Playstock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dutch fashion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I think that was your shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's another guy that released some
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember his name, but there's
been a few of them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there were a bunch of filial
generations released on IC mag and the
[SPEAKER_01]: like seed server fund and all kinds of
stuff over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if those were always coming
directly from you or if someone was f2ing
[SPEAKER_01]: him or f3ing him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was them f2ing or f3ing or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never I shared some I actually saw
some on and I got a reminder the other day
[SPEAKER_06]: on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this guy in Africa said he's got these
these plants and he's got them from a
[SPEAKER_06]: field in Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and then they were definitely ducks
for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like the original stuff that I
used to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And weirdly enough, I one of the first
trades I did was to to Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: This this last night over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so and she gave it to some guys who
were growing larger amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is actually possible that they did
come from stuff that I'd sent there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know, you never know how that
works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it goes long and far doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever hear of the Molokai frost,
Wally?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wonder if that might have been in
the ducks foot because my mate local bird
[SPEAKER_03]: seed grew a bunch of that from good gear
seeds and that stuff fucking stunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you're saying, you had some taller
seeds in the first F1s or F2s or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if maybe it's hybridized with or
something because that was super stinky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe because the guy that I I
swapped with, he also had that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they all lost a lot of stuff
around that same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like it seems to always happen
with us in this trade that everyone loses
[SPEAKER_06]: all their stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a flying Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were trading with the flying Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get it.
CK2.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just trying to think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puna Puna was where he lived or where he
got the stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the two.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, booze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions you want to ask either
of these guys before we move on to maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the more recent work?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going for the mango haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with a high notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we already mentioned the mango haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you want to tell us a bit more about
how you got to working with it recently
[SPEAKER_04]: and what that work has been like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I I got some from booze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually wanted older stock just because
some of the more recent things I've
[SPEAKER_05]: gotten, you know, the northern lights haze
and super silver haze that I've gotten
[SPEAKER_05]: recently from Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't representative of what I
remembered.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned wanting some and booze had
Wally stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, man, I'd love to grow his
because I know, you know, he's he knows
[SPEAKER_05]: what he's doing and it's it's likely older
stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, a year and a half ago or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them went through them,
found found the ones I liked, found unique
[SPEAKER_05]: ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found a male I really liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, made a bunch of seeds with
it, increased it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us a bit about what kind of
spread of, you know, expressions you saw
[SPEAKER_04]: in that and that pop?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those plants, it was interesting to me
at the same time I popped Wally's
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville's haze mango haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And comparatively, the mango haze was a
much thinner leaf plant, more open than,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what you would think of with the
haze plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they looked they looked more
similar to the A5 cut I was growing than
[SPEAKER_05]: the Neville's mango haze did.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were there were a lot of,
you know, they have this weird like as
[SPEAKER_05]: they put on new sets of leaves,
they kind of roll out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really characteristic trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, once you flower them,
you have you have these very strong,
[SPEAKER_05]: almost like green crack smelling mango
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have some that are like a dirty
metallic mango.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there were some that were kind of
like savory.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one that I swear smelled like like
Salisbury steak.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that is going in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like super savory.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a it's like a man, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like steak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's like a ground beef patty.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to be like it's like poor man,
like probably depression era steak.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, like when I was a kid,
we had it and it was something we got at
[SPEAKER_05]: school and like I had this plant and in
the mango haze, it was one of the later
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering ones, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just love the structure of it is,
you know, it didn't throw big buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It threw a lot of small kind of hazy
looking buds through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole time I flowered,
I was like, what the fuck is that smell?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just so obscure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one day it hit me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think I was like harvesting it
and I was like, it smells like Salisbury
[SPEAKER_05]: steak.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, for the most part,
it was there was a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: fruitier haze stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more mango than I kind of expected
it to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're great plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been smoking on a bunch of the dry
sift I made from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a big jar I kind of tap into
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have any that were like on the
lemony sort of kick?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lemon?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you didn't have lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like how, like, it's like a
more mellowed version.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of reminds me of like a really
mild version of some of the super sober
[SPEAKER_05]: hay stuff, that kind of lemony hazy thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, did you see a bunch of those on
your increase booth?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like incense stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've got a couple of coffee cuts
here, like the Harlem Dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my buddy's got this Aussie
Outback too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's in that like incensey sort of
frankincense realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a couple like that, one of my males
that I use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did, I increased three packs using
two males and then I utilized one male
[SPEAKER_03]: just to seed up all of my keepers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that male was on the incensey realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had just like, I called it like a
Crocsback pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaf was like contour, contour is the
wrong word.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't like variegated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a textured leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very ruffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I had three females that
were like that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I only had one.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend had this Kalina Negra from White
Buffalo Seeds and that's Seeds Man Hay,
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombian Black by Seeds Man Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there were a few of the mango haze
that smelled exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like that lemon sort of kick,
but I guess it's like an o-haze thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I was stoked on it because I
didn't get a lot of mango, but a fair bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of this lemony and like incensey sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't have to grow them properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they were just for seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had planned to fill the greenhouse with
them, but my greenhouses were too chockers
[SPEAKER_03]: to get them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they took ages to flip,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I put them in 72 hours darkness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, which Sam Sunkman had said was
like, what you do for sativas to show sex
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I chucked them outside and it still
took like a good five weeks for them to
[SPEAKER_03]: sex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, like the longest stuff I've ever had
to show sex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones I did outside here triggered
super late.
[SPEAKER_05]: But indoor, they don't really,
really hesitate I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of go right to it, which I
thought was pretty weird, but I had some
[SPEAKER_05]: that it was September before they flipped.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had to move some of the ones I did
outside into a greenhouse to finish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not that they took so long to
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, they triggered way later than,
I mean, they triggered later than A5 did
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told my buddy that and he's like,
fuck, that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he'd only grown a few as well and
hadn't got to flower them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So wow, super sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that's your like selection,
Wally, like when you got the seed line,
[SPEAKER_03]: like that's something my mate asked me to
ask you what, do you know what mango Hayes
[SPEAKER_03]: IBL is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what, what is it inbred in a certain
direction or?
[SPEAKER_06]: For earlier stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Shanty reckons.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't, I didn't really ask at the
time how many like generations he'd inbred
[SPEAKER_06]: or, or what he selected for.
[SPEAKER_06]: But obviously it was for earlier stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, I've grown a lot of mango Hayes
before just the normal one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of what I found was that insensi
sort of smell you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't until I grew this IBL,
I actually found a mango, mango Hayes,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was a bit of a surprise.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fatter bud though.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not like more ripening mangoes,
which I'm used to sour mangoes in like
[SPEAKER_06]: Asian stuff that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then I could see actually why it
was called mango Hayes prior to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more like incense Hayes to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It never came across a mango one.
[SPEAKER_04]: For Hein Lundsen, what were some of your
favorite crosses with the mango Hayes or
[SPEAKER_04]: what, you know, what, what did you like
coming out of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I've really enjoyed all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's, it has something I like in a
mail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, I think it's very transparent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get, you get the mango Hayes in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely, you get the effect from
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you get that insensi back into
it, but it lets the mother show through
[SPEAKER_05]: really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the, the Kim D and the TK
crossed the mango Hayes are both this,
[SPEAKER_05]: to me, it's like, it's like zombie weed,
you know, like you're it completely spaces
[SPEAKER_05]: your mind out, but you're still like
motivated.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're up doing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like mechanical motion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's, it's really kind of awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been smoking that every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then the, the green craft mango Hayes,
it really lets, I mean, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's very mango-y.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of, it goes in different
directions as it cures kind of,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that for flavor, that one's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: The break in Hayes, which is the electric
blue glue dog shit, whatever mango Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's I, I'm a big fan of that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have a bunch going right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've kind of been wanting to do a,
a EV project for a few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made, I think this was the sixth
outcross I made with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: To look for a male to that cross to the
plants are there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I wanted you to get variations on the
mother there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a few straight mango Hayes
plants, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_05]: it really lets the mother plant shine
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super cool to hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sound delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those crosses actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get some of them?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just the, um, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the East coast, our diesel Appalachia
one that I, that I recall.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make sure you get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you get?
[SPEAKER_02]: A five mango Hayes, mate, and some LA Kush
mango Hayes or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have, I'd have to, that,
that does see containers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got fucked their full way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have trouble finding stuff now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I can sort it all out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, there's so much stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lived for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even find what I, and I'm sure
it's in there, but now I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wally, did you have anything else to add
to the, uh, mango Hayes account?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, any, anything, um, come to mind while
high loads and was talking about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, some of my first experiences with
it, to be honest, I, um, it was,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than anything I had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that stuff go in later flower and it
was just pouring here for weeks,
[SPEAKER_06]: like literally every day, all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that stuff, um, you know, you fold
back the buds to check the callaxes for
[SPEAKER_06]: any damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and now I didn't get any,
and it finished and it was, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: super strong and, um, really euphoric and,
uh, the tolerance to build a tolerance to
[SPEAKER_06]: took a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoked that stuff for like maybe a month
even.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was still getting smashed,
uh, all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: the mold resistance here was incredible as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we really struggle with that,
especially as you take plants in the
[SPEAKER_05]: November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I, I, I moved all of mine,
you know, that late into a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, and they were, they were rock solid
even, you know, the heat went out at one
[SPEAKER_05]: point and, um, you know, it was a pretty
fucking piss poor run.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but the mango hay's not a speck of
mold on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're champions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredible plants.
