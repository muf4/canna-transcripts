[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_03]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_03]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_03]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, here with my co-host
Thousandfold, and today we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: again with Jay Generation from Federation
Next Generation Seeds, one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: BC seed makers there is, one of the most
successful BC seed makers there is that is
[SPEAKER_03]: still around doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Jay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to have you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand, you want to kick it off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned before, I was actually
just refreshing myself and watched the
[SPEAKER_00]: last couple of chats you had with Matt,
which was now maybe just under a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in there, yeah, in there you talked
about, you know, moving to Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe before we get into the nitty
gritty of what's been going on just
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, maybe tell us a bit about what
it was actually like to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what was that whole experience like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me, I'm quite used to moving in
my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I lived in Spain for quite a few years
and in Holland and back and forth to
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm quite used to moving, but this is a
long way to travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about a 30 hour flight from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been coming back and forth now
for the last year, about four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm making a more permanent switch
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the cost of living is so much cheaper
and to get into the legal system for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and selling seeds, it's way
cheaper and more economical here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is just it's a nightmare
bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just seemed like a natural move to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak Spanish or basic Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, yeah, this was just the nice
place where I can come and produce seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: here on a larger scale at a much,
much better price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Argentina mostly a Spanish speaking
nation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's all Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yeah, I didn't know if it was like
Portuguese, like Brazil, because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: down, isn't it down that region?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neighbors to Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they have their own version of
Spanish here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cultural, cultural Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a lot of preparation for you to
move like there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, over the last year and a half
or so, I've been making regular trips down
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting to know the market and going
to the big expos and the trade shows,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to know the distributors and the
licensing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so my choice is between Chile
and Argentina.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, I chose Argentina.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just there's more going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the like the culture and the city
is like Buenos Aires is like living in a
[SPEAKER_01]: European city like Barcelona or and then
we go out to the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like being in Ferris out in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going out to rural Alberta or something,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got kind of the best of both
worlds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to ask you right away is
what the actual kind of weed scene there
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, you know, genetics, culture,
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge weed scene here and it's
been growing by bounds every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've recently legalized it,
but the legalization process is so broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the medical personal licenses that
you can open a what they call an OMG club
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can grow weed for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't make a profit, but you can pay
your growers very well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The licensing that I've began here now is
for seed production, seed import,
[SPEAKER_01]: export and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's yeah, that's the process I'm
starting now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it is it is it less prohibitively
expensive down there to get those licenses
[SPEAKER_03]: than, say, Canada or the US?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's ridiculously economic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to almost say it because I
don't want my competition to move here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hundreds of dollars, not tens of
thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under a thousand dollars, I got all my
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's just a paperwork process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a long paperwork process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few months, a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to I'm doing my paperwork
process in one of the provinces,
[SPEAKER_01]: a smaller city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll happen a lot faster than doing it
here in Buenos Aires, where there's 17,
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 million people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes longer to get to the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got had my legal problems out in the
provinces here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I'm doing my paperwork
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it should happen pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty pleased with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a good lawyer getting my all my
papers in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's been an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it changed the work that you've been
doing to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that's a weird way of saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has moving there changed like the way
you've approached your work in any way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what have you been working on this
last year or so?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's lots of people here and and
farms that have been testing out my
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to see my genetics growing on
a much larger scale and see how they
[SPEAKER_01]: perform here more so than I could in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada was so prohibitive and most of it
was indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I was able to see a lot of my
genetics under greenhouses and on big
[SPEAKER_01]: farms and in Chile as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got friends over there that grow for
medical associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the scale that I've seen my
genetics growing on here is just so much
[SPEAKER_01]: better than Canada for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm getting to learn a lot about
my strengths in a different you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a different latitude, a different climate
and seeing which ones are thriving,
[SPEAKER_01]: which ones don't do so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us some specifics about like
specific highlights or contrasts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing pageants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the big thing down here because
we're south of the Amazon, the high,
[SPEAKER_01]: high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really, really big problem here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what everybody's looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the serious growers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for genetics that can
handle the humidity and don't get bud rot
[SPEAKER_01]: or powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a lot of the Spanish
genetics is what's on the market here,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Spanish seed companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tend to have a big problem with
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody that's been growing my
strains here, that's one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that they really, really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living in British Columbia on the west
coast, I'm sure you know all the rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of my strains are really,
really resistant to bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hearing a lot of good feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm very happy about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, harvest season now is going to be
in about two and a half months or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: about two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've had reports from last year as
well now because I've been coming here for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any ones specific that you're
pretty stoked about that have done well in
[SPEAKER_03]: that super wet climate down there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, yeah, there's been a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Avalon, I'm completely happy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Blue Dynamite, which is the Avalon
Original Grapefruit Cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I selectively bred those in Canada for
mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my surprises, though, have been my
half CBD, half THC strain, first contact.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just so amazingly healthy and robust
here with no bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds look like they're never grown
indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the outdoor fields I've seen of
it on two different farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do they take to that THC CBD down
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that they look for when
buying cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: More and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older people, yeah, it's more and more
becoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're like, they just want the
strong stuff to a lot of the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people here, the economy is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want the most bang for the buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my other strain that's been thriving
down here is my Latina Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I told you about that one, it's the
Colombian Red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crossed with a Mexican Sativa that I've
been working on back in Canada for years
[SPEAKER_01]: and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's plants now, it's still early
in the season, but three, three and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: meters and going strong and just starting
to flower now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you grab that Colombian Red
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember where it was sourced?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably at least 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was one of Rami and Joe's
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was back in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually can't nail it down right now
off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it long flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were this close to getting Rami and Joe
and this close to getting him on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you were going to... Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have talked to him and he's super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's super nice, but yeah, he's a nice
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the Mexican Sativa like that
you used in that line?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oaxacan that I used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, still, like I said, it's from 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of revived a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I revived it again and then brought the
seeds down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they're just thriving,
thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant doesn't stop growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're back at home, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to ask real quick as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, have you been working on anything
new since you've been there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a few local strains,
two local ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one is from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is from the northern provinces
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growers up in Corrientes, northern
province of Argentina have been growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the branching pattern, it reminds me
of the old original grapefruit from back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 90s and just constantly branches,
but has that almost like the haze smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are telling me when they
see the cut here, they think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: reminiscent of a lot of the old Brazilian
varieties from way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this group of growers have had it now
in the northern provinces here for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's a local variety that I
believe comes from Brazilian genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of the stuff comes down from
Paraguay and Brazil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Argentinians, for some reason,
don't grow a lot of their own weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though they have the perfect growing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any like old Argentina strains
you had heard of when you got there that
[SPEAKER_03]: were kind of legendary legacy type
strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say any names in specific,
but nobody really raved about any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: local genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't anything that really stood
out as something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk to people, all the local
growers, all the good stuff, genetics come
[SPEAKER_01]: from elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The local stuff is not worth bragging
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brazilian stuff has some good genetics
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, like the Bahia Blackhead was a
big one there, the Limon Verde,
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they take into the cookie stuff there,
like the modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they about that yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of the international Dutch and
Spanish companies that try to advertise
[SPEAKER_01]: some of their seeds as American genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's the flavor of the month type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cookies and that, I sell quite a
bit of the, well there's a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_01]: in the gelato and the granddaddy perps and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, the cookies hasn't been a big
thing here yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did smoke some really good white
truffles the other day though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh did you?
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That counts, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato as well maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: In-bread cookies for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you talked about some of the
genetics you're getting from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like being down there in terms
of being exposed to this kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: regional genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Buenos Aires and work around
here, so they're exposed to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: international genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's almost all Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Spanish and a few of the Dutch
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only one really American
country company that I've seen here at the
[SPEAKER_01]: trade show circuit and in the stores is
the Humboldt seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they've made it big everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so me, the next generation and
Humboldt are basically the only North
[SPEAKER_01]: American companies that we see on the,
making the rounds down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well that's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that it's not a ton of American
competition as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is one good thing too,
I think where I'm in a good position is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting sick of the Spanish
genetics and they're starting to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out it's all the same seeds being
repackaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: All slightly similar names, but it's all
coming from the same bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they figured that out now and they
want something fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's fucked up is in America,
they still haven't figured that shit out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe how it's all just white
label and repackaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody goes, but what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about it on the show a bunch
and people are just, it just like goes
[SPEAKER_03]: over their head that, no, there really are
picking from one bin, throwing it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of different seed packages for the
most famous companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know why, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: The psychology is like, yeah, yeah,
I know other people do that, but the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I buy isn't like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're buying a 10, 15 cents a seed
and then they turn around and put in a
[SPEAKER_01]: baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sell it for several dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mylar, the Mylar switch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to start digging into more
recent stuff before we jump into anything
[SPEAKER_03]: else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I had a little adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear some more about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounded pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, just, just bad luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to see, I've been in the province
here, the city of Rosario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my friend who has an ONG and a
medical cannabis club and he owns a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis radio station for all the,
and so I was going to go see him and have
[SPEAKER_01]: him help me with my paperwork to get
registered here in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were driving there a few weeks ago
and we got pulled into a check stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened to be a military check stop in
what happened to be a cartel city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, they pulled us in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know what to do with us
because we were foreigners and they found
[SPEAKER_01]: all my seed collection that I was about to
declare to the government to sign up for
[SPEAKER_01]: my licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were military police.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't understand the civilian law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they locked us up for several days
with no phone calls, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, just because they didn't
understand the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have the paperwork in correct
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only reason we got out is I have
some really good friends and they called
[SPEAKER_01]: the car rental company and they tracked
our car by GPS and the GPS showed that we
[SPEAKER_01]: are in a really bad, bad neighborhood
where people disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friends thought we got carjacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they called, so they called,
they followed the GPS and they found out
[SPEAKER_01]: we were in the back of a military
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was where they were keeping us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he showed up with his lawyer who
happened to be worked for the ministry of
[SPEAKER_01]: security for the province.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my buddy rolled in after day three.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no phone calls from anyone or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard, but my friend showed up
with the lawyer and the guys in suits and
[SPEAKER_01]: the police treated us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, let me stop you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was going through your mind in the
first day?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no idea with no phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, oh, we called the Canadian
embassy, but they're not answering the
[SPEAKER_01]: phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're completely useless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were just waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Colombians in the cell next to us
were telling us they'd been waiting there
[SPEAKER_01]: for six months just to get, and they
haven't even been charged yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were thinking the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, yeah, my friend showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, the police were treating
us horribly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't even go to the washroom
without cuffs on and a gun in your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, all the guards started
treating us like, like how do these
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadians know the lawyer for the ministry
of security and who are all these
[SPEAKER_01]: government officials showing up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just happened to be a friend of
mine who knows the right people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got lucky and he got us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God you had good friends that went
looking for you, you know, because
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise you would have... He found us at
4.30 in the morning following the GPS and
[SPEAKER_01]: found the car in the back of the compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he got on the phone with the
lawyers and, and yeah, they came in,
[SPEAKER_01]: they came in the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell of a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would have, like, do you have any
idea what would have happened if he hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: done that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like they hadn't been in touch with
him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we were told that we could have been
there for, for weeks and weeks before the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian embassy would have actually got
some kind of formal papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so right now, basically I'm,
I'm released right now temporarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't leave the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically the judge says, because I
was quite honestly gave them my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'm here to open my legal company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have my papers right in proper
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I'm coming to Rosario to do
my paperwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and she's seen that I was,
I was above board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got all my tax papers and all that's
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's released me, but, but I have to
get all of my licenses now by law.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, look, part of my conditions of
my release is I have to get all my
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis licenses fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might even get my licenses faster
than the local people because the judge
[SPEAKER_01]: says I have to.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could end up working out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think positive about it,
but I can't leave the country until I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: fully licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kept your passport and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, they actually, they gave me my
passport back, but with restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how has it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, how has it all felt?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how long ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sorry, you may not tell us,
but like about a week and a half ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's, how are the conditions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are the conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually, I was very pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a military prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was because they actually have
bunks and it's not eight guys to a cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actually had a mattress and a
blanket.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys that I was in with were good,
but there was zero privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doors are never closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the police just come through anytime
they want, just go through your things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically kept us sleep deprived
for three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, every, every two hours we'd come
in and wake you up and ask for an ID
[SPEAKER_01]: number or passport number, just some
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we never really slept for three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the food, the food was shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what you expect, I guess
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the guys, the guys in there were
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we were a novelty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd never seen Canadians down there
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in the cell beside, you know,
you know, cocaine guys that got seized
[SPEAKER_01]: with a big airplane from Medellin and then
our cellmates, a big ecstasy dealer and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody was treating us like,
like weird, like, why are you here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even have a joint with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no flower even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even a single joint with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the judge and the prosecutor right now
are arguing that they're trying to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what classification this fits under
because the laws are still being written
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't really a crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just failure to do my paperwork in
the right order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's what we're working on
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm going to do whatever they ask of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to get my licenses and just
try to get back to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it affect anything you currently have
growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have to chop stuff down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I shouldn't even ask that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the next one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it slow you down at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It slowed me down some.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll with the punches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rough, rough way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All for seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: All just trying to, to grow some,
some legal weed in a, in a country that's
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to be really good with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is, it is very good with it,
but my Spanish is a little bad and the
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork, I didn't get it filed in the
right order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's basically where it's
basically, I'm going to be looking at a,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably paying a few fines and I'll be
fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least it wasn't cartel people
that picked you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it was narco police.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the police that hunt the narcos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the guns to our heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I bet that's some serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not used to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first time I've ever had a legal
problem in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's gotta be very under,
especially in another country where you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't really speak the language as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't as bad for me, but my,
I had my friend just visiting completely
[SPEAKER_01]: innocent from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd come down to visit me for a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go do some fishing and he
came with me and, and so he ended up doing
[SPEAKER_01]: three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's with me now as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and he didn't speak a single word of
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was, he's a lot more stressed than I
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I at least, I at least know the language
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're waiting right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's waiting to get his money and his
phone back from the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's still there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got to wait till everything's
released.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did they, did they file charges on him
as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I, it was me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I told the police and the judge
straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my, my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own the seed company seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it was pretty, it's pretty
obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got nothing to do with the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what a wild ride, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to, you're going to end up on
like locked up abroad or something
[SPEAKER_03]: undiscovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I got good friends here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even imagine if I were in that
same situation, like trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: realistically having to rely on someone
else to figure out one that you're missing
[SPEAKER_03]: to, to take action.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought when you get it sitting there,
you start thinking, okay, just keep your
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth shut and like, give them time to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was day two, two and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, did they figure this out
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that like a miracle they showed
up out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the police, they treated us like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after we had my friends come and
visit us, we started treating,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting treated a lot, a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end, when, when the judge
gave us the release and we went back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the barracks to pick up our bags and our
reclaim our stuff to the police office,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were all joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were all friends, which is
fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but two of them asked me,
uh, said that these are like being a
[SPEAKER_01]: police officer here is horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, when you get your license,
can we come work for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The police asked me for a job leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what kind of bizarre old world
is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Treat me like shit and I'm going to pay
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yesterday you had a gun in my face
while I was sitting on the toilet,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not gonna happen pal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we can, we can definitely come back to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to ask you like,
what, what does the rest of the year look
[SPEAKER_00]: like for you now after this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm just, um, yeah, I'm gonna just go
through my paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm getting a job here with my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I get my taxes filed in I'm
legally in this system here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for there's no NG here that grows for
a big medical association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they want me to come help from,
um, on the farm because they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody that can grow on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically they want me to come and
advise them on how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus I've, uh, opening a, I've had a
Airbnb, like an Airbnb, a hostel here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Buenos Aires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've, I have a seven room hostel
downtown Buenos Aires, which is doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: little side project here is pot friendly,
uh, hostel, you know, like what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: tourism they like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, like how many tourists go
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a big city for tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a concert in South America,
like whether it's anybody famous,
[SPEAKER_01]: Buenos Aires is where they come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, 18 million people live here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it reminds me of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask if you like,
uh, had you bumped into many other
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadians while you were there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too many Canadians.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of Americans, there's a
lot of gringos here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a huge expat community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of strange fellows too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everybody Kenny there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, before, before we came on,
um, but there was someone that I had met a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that Jay knows named named Mr. Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was cool to see him as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who we're speaking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Kenny Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost all the people in Amsterdam,
like when I was first getting in the scene
[SPEAKER_03]: knew who he was and he was kind of,
you know, the dude to know back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool to see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the community and the people
you meet, like, have you gotten to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the other local, either like seed
makers or growers, or is it kind of still
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit more distant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've been very fortunate here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my, my, my one partner that I work
with, she, um, has a lot of my
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution in Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows everybody in the business in
South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: She speaks at all the big expos.
[SPEAKER_01]: She owns the Cannabis and Hemp Museum in
Valparaiso, Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's owned the Cannabis and Hemp Museum
there for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she has pot-friendly bed and
breakfast, has a host of cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's helped me mix with the local
community in the South for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to go all to the private events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few growers down here that are
trying to, right now, a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to team up with me and I'm still
not sure which direction to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because they want to, you know,
it's a business opportunity, but I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do things myself and not team up with too
many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it might take me slow longer to get
into the system, but I'm my own boss then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's how I prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't move, I didn't move down here to,
uh, grow for other people, but I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: offered some several big farms down here
that are licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I'm taking my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in any hurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well now, now I'm in a hurry,
obviously, after my legal problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, you know, I have been
kind of easing into it quite slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I, I, I sponsor them, the sponsor
of a few of the big cannabis cups in
[SPEAKER_01]: Cordova and Rosario and North Buenos
Aires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've gotten to know the community very
well in the last few years.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there several cannabis cups a year
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many, many.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're, they're popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more every, every year there's
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is, is, are the Spanish there in heavy
presence or are they mostly doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: mailing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're here in a heavy presence,
but they usually team up with a local
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they have to go through the
licensing process as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the big farmers here that with
the licenses, they get contracts with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Spanish companies or the Dutch companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make their seeds low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they can't import seeds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be produced here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so importing is, is not, not really
allowed, but obviously everybody does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still setting up the framework of
the business here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more and more the seed that's being
sold here is being produced here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to the Spanish companies,
like in some of the Dutch companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: are they actually sending their own gear
down there or are they just having them
[SPEAKER_03]: produce seeds and packaging it as their
gear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I believe a bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make enough here to get into the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like it's a good place to
produce a lot of seeds though,
[SPEAKER_03]: by, you know, the economy wise,
how cheap it is to produce seeds down
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the economy is, is yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one reason I can be here,
um, you know, for a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars, they can rent the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and yeah, labor's cheap and highly
skilled.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roads are good, better than Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they have economic problems,
but everything seems to work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have a couple actually, but,
uh, so while you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: edges, it reminded me of what's been going
on in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you, have you heard much of that Jay,
like the recent changes again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I haven't fallen too closely here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a bunch of people moved
there because they were opening up,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, rec medical, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newest government is like doing a full
one 80 on Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I wonder what's going to happen to
all our friends or people we know who've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually moved there to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I have a few friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newest government's not keen on it,
but they're keeping mid as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in Argentina here too, we just had,
pardon me, the, uh, election a few months
[SPEAKER_01]: ago of that, the new, uh, president here,
and he claims to be a libertarian,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think he's pretty hard on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people, some people are scared of
what he's going to do, but I think this is
[SPEAKER_01]: so ingrained into the system now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's corruption on every level here
that on other levels that the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: corruption here, there's no point,
there's no way for them to get this out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, like, even if, even if the government
does want to change it, it's cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: in now, um, there's, there is no changing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other question I had was,
uh, what's going on back in Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are you needing to maintain anything
over there while you're still in
[SPEAKER_00]: Argentina?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I have, um, I have my genetics,
um, safe with, uh, uh, friends back in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada and, uh, just guarding my mother's
trains, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, my partner is still in Canada
running your website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going, he's well as well stocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, before I moved down here, he made sure
he is well stocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, yeah, other than that,
things are going on smoothly in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, we just couldn't carry the
overhead with what it costs to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to run an operation in Canada
legally was just, it made no sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not much different in the U S right
now for a lot of the, the big seed makers
[SPEAKER_03]: here, it's getting so, so prohibitively
restrictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people think that because,
you know, they hear in other States that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's more legal, even in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realistically it's less legal to grow
more legal to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when the quality dips and the
prices licenses skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're, I like the design,
how they're doing the laws down here and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's not cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's harder for a big
corporations to monopolize.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way they set it up here and then they
kept it community based and club based for
[SPEAKER_01]: around the communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, it has an O and G or a
company that wants to sell weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can grow up to 1,300 plants with,
uh, with your patients and, and the prices
[SPEAKER_01]: here are double or triple that we,
that we get for it in Canada, like almost
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 U S dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in Canada, you can barely sell it for
three or $4 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotten so low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, here it's amazing how high the
prices and how low the cost of production
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for, for me, it's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there, is there a connoisseur quality
market there to be had yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've got a few people talking about
their opening dab bars and clubs like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like anywhere they got your price
range from your $5 a gram weed to your $12
[SPEAKER_01]: a gram weed, um, for the top, top quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people here don't know the
top quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you show it, it's, it's mind
boggling to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just making its way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the skills of the local growers
are, are coming up pretty fast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's farming, it's a farming
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a farming community, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They shouldn't take them too long to
figure out how this plant works and
[SPEAKER_03]: operates and what we want out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good stuff is still being grown
indoors here because outdoors is the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, yeah, I've seen a lot of my strains
being grown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and locals don't know this difference
between indoor and outdoor and it kicks
[SPEAKER_01]: ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How, how's the electrical, um,
infrastructure there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to run big light grows there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's very, very difficult to
find the right property with enough
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the average house here, um,
even my hostel downtown, uh, has only 40
[SPEAKER_01]: amps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can barely turn on more than three air
conditioners in the, in the, in the hostel
[SPEAKER_01]: at a time without blowing the breakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's inside the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, I can't grow there
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, you have to get a farm and
once you have a farm, though the sun is
[SPEAKER_01]: the weather is great here all year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you have, uh, the bedrooms to
keep your clones and the mothers alive and
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep feeding the greenhouses,
um, from plants from the indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, that's, that's been one of my
biggest interests in, in a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: moving to Thailand or any of these rural
areas in South America was the electrical
[SPEAKER_03]: infrastructure for a lot of us that are
used to doing like big indoor operations
[SPEAKER_03]: for our seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, it's not, it's not really
economical to do that in the United States
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore either.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's become so expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It per kilowatt hour and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are looking to different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some of the places I've been looking
at is just the way they build the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, structures here in the houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually, uh, you can rent,
uh, like usually on the main floor will be
[SPEAKER_01]: a store or a restaurant or a mechanic
shop, a place like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the apartments above it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking kind of for an entire
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so if you have a mechanic shop or a
restaurant, you know, you have no shortage
[SPEAKER_01]: of, uh, of, uh, electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, those type of locations,
um, for a place in this city, but most of
[SPEAKER_01]: my growing, I like to do out in the
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's, we're looking for that
right now, um, for a country place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, what kind of strains do you
have stocked with, uh, with Taylor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, pretty much our whole catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we still have it well stocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few actually strains that aren't
on the, on our site yet that, that it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should get on working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a really good Avalon CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's, so it's got that Avalon
strengths outdoors and beautiful purple
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but for people who are like maybe
hearing you for the first time,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you tell us some more about Avalon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's one of your like flagship
names, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was actually the very first
strain I bred back in Canada and I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: it was 95 or 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Afghani hash plant crossed with
the, uh, original blueberry that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: back then in the mid late nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I did that first cross outdoors
and I've been selectively in breeding it
[SPEAKER_01]: now for almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I, I did all my selecting in that
genetics outdoors on Vancouver Island in,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a rainy, rainy, windy part of the
Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, the first few years
when I was doing the selecting of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was breeding with, you know, you'd get
that first year and you'd lose half of it
[SPEAKER_01]: to bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you breed the best plants that
made it through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after several years or a decade of me
selectively breeding outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: it became so, uh, resistant to molds and,
and, and fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can, it can sit out in the rain for
two weeks and you're not going to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it'll put up with the wind and
that's what I, that's what I bred it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that's for the wet
West coast where it's, we're wet all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, a few of the hybrids with that
are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my blue dynamite, which the Avalon
crossed with the, the grapefruit dynamite,
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's the buds right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, just the most picture
perfect blue, blue, uh, buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's the one seed that's
been flying off the shelves for us right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody, once they grow it,
they're, they're coming back for more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody wants to try any one strain
of ours, right now that wants them to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, be impressed, try our blue dynamite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really popular one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to smoke a bunch of the Avalon space
recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What people don't realize is that like the
sweet pink grapefruit to me, at least does
[SPEAKER_03]: resembles Gittles a lot in the turf
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was already existing long before
Gittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's very similar in the turf profile,
almost identical in many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wouldn't be surprised if they were
related in some way, shape or form,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's so similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, sometimes it's not just like the
popular name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go find out what's in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, go talk to people who've been around
for a long time and you'll learn about
[SPEAKER_03]: this kind of stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, uh, yeah, who knows
what's in a lot of this and people read it
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was super nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it did look like you're saying it
looked like indoor, but grown outdoor,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is it's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I like to recommend your stuff
for people in coastal climates in the U S
[SPEAKER_03]: because it is so hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hardy and mold resistant and it's
proven and true for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Avalon space that you tried,
uh, was that indoor or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdoor Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our buddy is a big fan of yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's always throwing some, uh,
some of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a strain that we have
quite a few seats of that still sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too many people bought it because I'm
shitty at marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't really told that to anybody,
but, uh, and there are only available in
[SPEAKER_01]: regular seats, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are regular on your website.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the space that, what was that
one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was just another variety from a big
medical club in, um, in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back, back country harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had an 11 acre farm and they have,
uh, did a massive phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the cuts off of their
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an impressive farm up in the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the cut, um, it's very, it's,
it's silvery, uh, and I'm more of a lime
[SPEAKER_01]: green, not, not a deep dark green,
uh, really silvery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess not the flavor would come from the
Avalon more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The space didn't have a lot of intense
flavor on its own, but extremely resonance
[SPEAKER_01]: and light green flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what did get the hype right
with the Avalon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avalon brought the flavor to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the first thing I could taste
was, it was sweet pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh yeah, I know this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's some grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a lot of fruit, a lot of grapefruit in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else you want to
highlight as far as your strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right now, well, actually,
yeah, the, our, uh, our red truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a Colombian red truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one variety that out of all my
variety, people ask me about for making a
[SPEAKER_01]: hash or full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red truffles that resin just melts in
your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the trichomes separate really easy
for making bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make a lot of bubble and,
uh, and that's one that I'm going to do as
[SPEAKER_01]: soon as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm doing a big phenol hunt for it
here, uh, just for bubble hash production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're large, large plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the Colombian red, obviously the
sativa in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's probably about nine and a half
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere between nine and 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the fertilizers you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what was looking through the offspring
like for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's kind of the, you know,
the two parents I imagine could hardly be
[SPEAKER_00]: less similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you guys know, I know my Colombian
red, but, uh, this was just a really good,
[SPEAKER_01]: good cutting on it for the medical company
in Canada at the truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and you guys probably know way more
than what the truffles than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know it dumped hash and I did the
hybrid and it dumped even more hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the actual truffles much of
the history.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you guys, I actually don't know
much other than it's a cookies variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of inbred cookies or some sort
of thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't kept myself up to date on a lot
of what's going on in the U S for the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it just seems like it's changes so
fast, but it's mostly the same genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: being renamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all it's the last, last 10 or 12
years ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just work on my own stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I've had the show, I've had to pay
more attention to it because people always
[SPEAKER_03]: ask you about these certain things,
but yeah, I just don't really,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather, I'd rather learn about the old
BC strains from guys like you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And talk about that as opposed to the new,
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down here and everybody's asking me
about all these, you know, North American
[SPEAKER_01]: strains and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I couldn't care less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, where's your local stuff?
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the Brazilian?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try some Paraguay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We eat some Bolivia and some Peruvian
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just want to talk about what I
wanted to ask you more about, like how,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your access like to genetics like
that, you know, from, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Paraguay, you know, wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, I know quite a few people
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a work with them in different countries
here with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, yeah, I actually built up a nice
little collection of, of stuff down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I get my license, I'll be able to
try a lot of this local stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I do anything too serious,
I have to make sure all my papers are in
[SPEAKER_01]: order now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to go through that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when you are back up and running,
are you documenting this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sharing it online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an Instagram account where
you're sharing pictures or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little, very little right now because
I'm, it's still under investigation and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and actually the police have my,
my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have, they have, they have my
phone in my car and all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I'm still in the middle of the
process right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's all going to work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to be a process.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But afterwards, you know, assuming once
you're clear of that stuff, will you,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think you'll be documenting a lot
of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excited.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I got, I got two different
Instagram pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Canadian one, jgeneration at Instagram,
and then next generation Latin American
[SPEAKER_01]: edition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything else you want to get
in before we close it up and let you get
[SPEAKER_03]: back to your dengue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeling a little ill here with the
mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What time is it there in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's five, 10 PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting at about 10 PM here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I figured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else you wanted to plug
though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not, we have, uh, right now we've got
a few new auto flowers on our website
[SPEAKER_01]: right now for, and some specials on for
springtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my, tell anybody, give my partner a
call.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's always good for giving good
deals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really friendly too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hesitate to call him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a number you can give out here
that you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't have it off, uh, by heart,
but yeah, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll keep you guys updated on any
other changes in the adventures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get you on as soon as I heard
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, God damn, we need to talk
about this and see if we can get something
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure having you and,
