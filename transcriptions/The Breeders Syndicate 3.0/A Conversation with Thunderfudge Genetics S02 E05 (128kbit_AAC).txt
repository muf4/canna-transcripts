[SPEAKER_01]: Ready, go!
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Fudge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aw, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working, working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took two weeks off, so you just have to
come home and do all the stuff you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do for the last two years and two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no rest for the wicked, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going with you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, dude, what do you got growing in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got that whole back row.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all GMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of stretched on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It always does, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking stretched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's about seven feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Big Red Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is melanate to dosey-dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he calls it pistachio.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some Kush cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ice cream cake to mint julep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mint julep is Lambo Mike's mint chocolate
chip cookie to DNA kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one green ice head on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 25 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in five gallon bags.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one, nice and open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's got a nice open structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's across the table on all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, another one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the raspberry julep to mint julep
ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rocking those out at smallpox.
[SPEAKER_00]: For six months, I think or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to find the ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's ever easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you say you're going to do it,
it never works out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of wallow through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to work a line is like being the
kid that has to practice the trumpet while
[SPEAKER_00]: the other kids are out going ape shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're playing in summer, and you're kind
of stuck moving in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tedious, but it's rewarding at a
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be the standard, but not so
much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the market moves and the attention
spans and whatnot of kids, it moves
[SPEAKER_00]: through so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a buddy who's doing a rec,
and he said he's flipping strains out
[SPEAKER_00]: every two to three runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just two to three and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tough to do what we do in this
industry if you want to play with that
[SPEAKER_00]: hype stuff, or you want to stick to your
guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not in that hot zone,
wait till what you're doing comes back in,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be, at least for me,
five, six years, seven years before
[SPEAKER_04]: something would come back around that I
made that wasn't popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then everybody'd want it, and it would
be old seeds, or I would just be hard of
[SPEAKER_04]: giving them all out for free at that
point, because they didn't sell.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the tough one, is nowadays I think
a lot of breeders just kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: they throw those filler plants in that
they're not going to be the main bangers
[SPEAKER_00]: out of what they're dropping, but they're
going to be plants that just kind of make
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of plants are thrown in
in guys' menus as options rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I can get 2,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get 4,000 bucks off that plant,
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pushing big plants and just
pulling the shit out of them and moving on
[SPEAKER_00]: to the next one, on and on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been something I've been covering
lately a lot, just trying to explain to
[SPEAKER_04]: people the difference between how we used
to do it and now where the market is
[SPEAKER_04]: pushing everyone to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, testing was a given, and if someone
didn't test, we always would give them
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you ain't even testing that
shit now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the fucking advantage,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the advantage now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was always one guy to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I assume this is untested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the hype boys would be like,
shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alien Genetics 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all saw that go down, and that became
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our new norm, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're hitting it hard,
running as fast as you can, with the brand
[SPEAKER_04]: new line you're making across,
and testing it, you're at least 18 months
[SPEAKER_04]: in, if you're doing it right, and actually
seeing if anything's good, running it all
[SPEAKER_04]: the way out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is not a time span that works for
the current market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of people, and they're
playing, and they work this to F6 or back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross five or something, and you go back
on their feet, and the arithmetic just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, dude, you obviously just pulled
the two best looking plants you had and
[SPEAKER_00]: set them aside and bred those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no full look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely gambling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's always a gamble.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what guys, I won't name any
names, but there's a lot of guys who have
[SPEAKER_04]: figured out the plan that if they sell
seeds, that the majority of the market is
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to grow out those seeds for at
least a year, year and a half maybe,
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the negative feedback,
they've got two years in to fucking just
[SPEAKER_04]: put a bunch of bullshit out and run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the time span for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's a lot of guys that have
came and gone in the last two years and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably popped up as someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have many fly by night people
there is in this industry, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sucks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot different back in the day,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't access to all these cuts and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you knew when you got something it was
real because people just weren't like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hearing you talk about provenance for
the last couple of years has been really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool because a lot of people don't
understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see descriptions of cuts on people's
clone banks and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, it's strawberry,
this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it goes down to the
description, they're like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's great in extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, whoa, come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's strawberry, it should be dripping
off your skin when you leave the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cover-ups, I think there's a lot of
that with the banana, too, which is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: pet peeve of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few big clone guys out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's their explanation on why their
banana is a banana is because you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go make oil out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made it halfway through flour over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you just cut out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just no banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Banana is banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff should be popping the second
you have trichromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know it, you know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the smell is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what your stems are going to
smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say this, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can rank on stem rubbers all
they fucking want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will masturbate a fucking stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much as looking for a
particular smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking for a familiar smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows what a chem smells like in
the shower or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't, you can rub that damn
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll at least tell you if you're in the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've rubbed that girl down before
many times, I mean, it's no different than
[SPEAKER_00]: grandma's cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just know that essence it's
putting off, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: No different than grandma's vagina.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should know what that smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about your starts,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were some of the first lines that got
you into wanting to make seats in the
[SPEAKER_04]: first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first seeds I ever made were from a
old University of Washington hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that came to me through some people from
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that and the coffee bubba in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we wore those fuckers like a damn
placard on our chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our family crest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in our neighborhood,
you knew it by the city and people call it
[SPEAKER_00]: by the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh yeah, you must know
so and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would kind of get to know people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you never really know what you had or
whatnot because people just weren't open.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did rottalize some hash plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the 90s, I just wanted to continue
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read up on the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, wow, OK, well, I guess I'm
going to flower these things 17 weeks and
[SPEAKER_00]: just hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up with a lot of really nice
seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody was kind of affiliated with
some just small time airports and whatnot
[SPEAKER_00]: and their mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were flying around and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had all lost their cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of just redistributed an S1
amongst the buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody thought it was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, wow, man, I'd really like
to do this more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years went by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew always.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never got to really level up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a working two kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truck breaks, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody needs something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really got ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up, after medical caught on
here, getting hooked up with my buddy from
[SPEAKER_00]: construction who opened up a grow shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got hooked up with old exotic Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were guys that just kind of shopped at
the same place and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a damn good fucking grower,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he was working with was a lot of
TGA gear and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was more, man, I found a guy on
Craigslist who had cuts to the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Nirvana catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a lot of this old ice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of paradise seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, I was more about the
Thunderfuck and the stuff that was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were still in the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though we saw some great California
weeds show up in the fall, unless you had
[SPEAKER_00]: the balls to run the I-5 corridor,
they're just wasn't a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on towards seven and eight,
hell, people were just flying up and down
[SPEAKER_00]: that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you guys actually just flooded
our freaking market out at a point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And during those years, 2006, 2007,
Amsterdam, if people don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: those seed companies were still
dominating.
[SPEAKER_04]: The American seed companies were still
small.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were very few big ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think at that time, me and Subcool were
the only ones on the attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which had just taken the market over.
[SPEAKER_04]: The attitude had just started and taken
the market over.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's why guys in the US were
getting our seeds from Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's just what you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was what was in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be four or five months before you
got your seeds back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no tracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just went to wherever you were having
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looked every day or called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the birthday card there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it there yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like today where you can just
press a button.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your bank's on point, 72 hours
later, you have seeds in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I started working with Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, the ogres and banana tush
and grape ape and granddaddy were just
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely just murderizing us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were still all growing the Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, wow, how can we get a hold
of this California action?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we were building a room over here,
my buddy financed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike helped pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got growing over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put the walls up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, Mike had made seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wasn't actively pushing them or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really modest about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, how can we beat these damn
California genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you compete?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first answer was Subcool seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was in every dispensary on
every corner here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every magazine you could pick up was
Subcool at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had just absolutely saturated the
market with those $50 freaking $40 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Mike had a few flame crosses and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started kind of pushing them on
this thing called the Northwest Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Thumb, which was our medical forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually became pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of Michigan guys on
there and a lot of guys that poke in there
[SPEAKER_00]: just for fun and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was so much shit talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the guy who made the Green Thumb's
uncle actually was the founder of Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the founder of Silk Road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they scared a lot of people off
once they started trying to push Bitcoin
[SPEAKER_00]: for dollars back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was still 2011 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pushed the Flav stuff and got our
feet wet with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the infamous
Starfighter pack was bought off Alien.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Mike had paid logic for those
auctions right after the Alien auctions
[SPEAKER_00]: right after the Starfighter auctions.
I remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That auction was pretty well known because
it went for so fucking much money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember how much it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one pack that apparently went
for $4,500 and didn't get paid for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mike had bought that pack for
$2,100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds never showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logic said, hey, can you just get a hold
of Alien?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Alien sent him 30 seeds, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it was the 29 and the 30
that actually made the F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what would have happened if
Logic would have sent seeds?
Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where those strong Alien,
Kush, Dom plants came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: By God, if you go look into Obs's pictures
of Alien Kush and then start looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's Starfighter, it was like,
wow, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can see where we're going with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did get a chance over time to
smoke Obs's cherry alien dog and some
[SPEAKER_00]: other personal Obs's cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, wow, Starfighter is a
direct kiddo of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants, direct.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like any time I see Starfighter
stuff or anything descended from it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can always tell that it has the alien
technology, like fucking resin rails,
[SPEAKER_04]: the type of resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It breeds very true for all that stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his mail, I mean, I got to say kudos,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he picked a solid mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thing was just like a freaking
car wash, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put an average plant in there,
and it would just shine it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had great traits as far as that went.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only downfall, I think what moved him
away was, one, he didn't want to be a one
[SPEAKER_00]: trick pony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two is, if you look at the
numbers, it has high THCA, but the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the categories are zeros.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much else other than that THCA
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it kind of hit its ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what kind of led to its
demise is people were expanding on that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that new bar of 26% THC in 12 or 13
went from like 17 up into the 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, wow, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit got changed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of screwed us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of a lot of great traits and
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which kind of leads me back to where I
started, was with the Ultimate Chem08.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky enough to have some friends
back in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to tell a story or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I mean, you hear some of
these big ones out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, OK, yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're sitting next to Skunk BA,
and you fucking dropped your hot dog on
[SPEAKER_00]: his leg.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we basically had some friends from
Seattle that traveled around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would follow the dead and have
this contest every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would pick up weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the dead took a break,
they'd come home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd get the sweet blueberry and some
of the skunk in the KGB, the killer green
[SPEAKER_00]: bud that we thought was lost in the mid to
late 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that stuff would come back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, wow, I got to smoke some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, OK, man, all bullshit aside
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Kinetics, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was these blue cans that were
popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Bodie was over on Kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Relentless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A ton of fucking people were over there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Surfer had some Starfighter F1 beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was after Alien and Surfer had
their fallout when Surfer was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to pimp Alien's cuts out,
I guess, that Alien's existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Surfer was selling packs of
Starfighter F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the new guy over at Kinetics,
Mike and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our reps aren't built.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hit them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hey, bro, you know, I'd love to
get some of those Starfighter F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you know, I gave my list
because it was all about the list over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody flexed their list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Jaws won every time,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy is such a fucking dork.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, the biggest poser to ever hit
our scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to Oso Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, he did well, you know,
trading his own beings for other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: beans, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, his collection is fucking huge,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any letter you say, they're just you know,
40 or 50 strains there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we all know those peach
colored walls with the blankets over the
[SPEAKER_00]: windows, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, I was never on Kinetics
because I had been on the pre-turser
[SPEAKER_04]: called Pot Pimp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the owner was a dude named Rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he literally ripped everyone off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his moderators were like, oh my god,
everybody got ripped off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got ripped off too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start a new site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just started ripping people off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of goes into some stuff that
I've always wondered about because that,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, let me ask you this, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Rips dead?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think Rips is still walking this
fucking earth and stalking people on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sure on a different name,
but sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Him and Mr. DJ K.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a few other dudes on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember off the top of my head,
but they were all part of that same crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ, I'm friends with Mr. DJ K now and
always have been, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was his homie, his tight
homie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he went and started a new site and it
was suspicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we were at Kinetics and I
basically got punked by Surfer telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: I only trade for Top Dog or Elite Genetics
gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, this is still,
you know, 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't been around on the internet,
man, you know, much, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an old school dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, so at that point I was
like, you know, fuck, I know, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who Top Dog is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to find out who this fucking Elite
Genetics guy is, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I Google him and I start seeing this,
this double dip banana and these names,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and I'm like, great names,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a big, like soda fountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wow, this guy, you know,
the twisted purple, the lemon Larry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, well, I was just like,
wow, this, this just sounds like the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get down with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I didn't read far enough,
you know, but, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made it kind of my point to get as
much Elite Genetics gear as I could in a
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someday I could throw that shit back in
that dude's face, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, I started there,
you know, you were at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about before, you're bidding
on the same pack of 08s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's night to late night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's where my journey began.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I popped those, those seeds and,
you know, not knowing what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, I mean, back in the day,
man, nineties, eighties, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was nothing had names, you know,
I mean, it was, you know, it was the kid
[SPEAKER_00]: build.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was whatever the chronic and where's
the weed, whatever, you know, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and it was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I smoked this ultimate cannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, grandma's cookies,
you know, I've been here before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, you know, I started,
you know, you know, expanding because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the forums and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I got to smoke some D and
some four and, and, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff lemon Hoco was growing,
you know, he's kind of the, like the old
[SPEAKER_00]: master splitter for all the breeders here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't care what they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was, he was the guy doing it
long before any of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, using predator might
and, and doing things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, everyday practices now,
but you know, 10 years ago, we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this guy's a fucking freak,
dude, you know, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about all the people that came
out of that little Northwest green thumb,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, you know, exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, uh, you know, Pacific Northwest roots,
Kaia, uh, uh, DVG, you know, Eric does
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve, you know, you know, he was pushing
the granddaddy perps label at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, he, you know, doing his own
thing now and shit, you know, he fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can totally vouch that he was doing
Ken's breeding, you know, there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no bullshit to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in the room is confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: So lemon Larry is different than Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys in Atlanta, Larry OG was going
big time, but lemon Larry was less,
[SPEAKER_04]: less.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the time, lemon Larry became popular
on forums for a while, but it was a lemon
[SPEAKER_04]: tie Larry OG, not just Larry OG that
happened to be lemon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the people in the, in the audience
reading on and talking, but no sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: DVG was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was doing all 10 stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember back then I was always
fucking trolling Ken because he was such a
[SPEAKER_04]: lamer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would always be super cool to me,
even though he was on the Duke,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Ken account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, he's, he's got a quick
fuse, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you, if you sat down in
that guy's living room and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing, but fucking love, you know,
he's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a quick fucking fuse,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I've seen it, you know, I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you know, yeah, I mean,
I started with the ultimate cam and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, the, the Oh wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I, I ended up getting
the sour Larry cut from, uh, from Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from Zoolander and Dr. Frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean Mrs. Dr. Frost, you mean Lacey
Frost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lacey Frost, uh, you know, did a lot of
animal cookie stuff and, uh, viral G and
[SPEAKER_00]: he, uh, took a bunch of people's money and
went and bought some boobs and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that was, that's probably the
smartest idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would have done the same because
that's killer idea, killer idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, I ended up,
you know, he kept on pushing on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you need to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do a backcross and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, man, I'm still old
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to send you, you know,
because he, I was going to send them,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, some pollen and, uh, you know,
cuts of my ultimate cam awake females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, you know, I,
I just found these and where I'm from,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't share dude, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, I had a tough time with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was finally like, man, just,
you know, this guy says he has alien cuss,
[SPEAKER_00]: yada, yada, yada, yada, you know,
and, uh, he's like, just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: be nice to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to get some of his seeds
and, and, uh, uh, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up sending them the ultimate cams
and uh, you know, four or five days later,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get, I get this box and it was delivered
to Mike's shop and no, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delivered to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring it over to Mike's shop and we
opened this thing up and there's water
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out the bottom and we cracked this
thing open immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: A flyer comes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, oh shit, you know,
this is hot, you know, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we pull this thing just directly put into
a box and it was planted in the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: yanked out of the ground and it was in a
six inch rock wall cube that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking, it just reeked like avid and
forbid and, and all the bad luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, oh no, you know,
so, so I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, I put it back in the box and
we left it outside for two days in like
[SPEAKER_00]: February and I was like, fuck that,
fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hit them up that dude,
you were, you're a dick, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got thinking about it and I was
like, wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to hit a civilian up that doesn't
grow, that can't get any collateral damage
[SPEAKER_00]: and pay them, you know, to nurse that
thing back to hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I went, bought a light and,
and you know, bought, bought some as Max
[SPEAKER_00]: and bought some, you know, one step,
uh, Oh God, I can't remember that one step
[SPEAKER_00]: food, you know, just basic glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I gave a dude two ounces to,
to give it to me clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, it was like three
months later, I got this plant back that
[SPEAKER_00]: was just, you know, thoroughly shellacked
and barely alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so locked out and you know,
the process begun, you know, I chose my 08
[SPEAKER_00]: mail and, and, uh, uh, you know,
man, it's, I, I compare you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all breeding, man, it's just, just like
building a house, man, or a car or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, man, you know, you, you start
with the best foundation you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you just, you just build up
from there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, you just take your
time and do it right, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you, you could see there for,
you know, about four years, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people were just having,
you know, breeders were having terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: luck with, with, with intersecting and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's become a lot more,
you know, accepted and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not on a small, you know,
a smaller level, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people weren't looking at their males and
they were just throwing anything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it really showed, it really fucked
up a lot of good gene pools, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, you know, I, I, I just try to
start the best plants in it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as many as I can, like, you know,
like we both know, you know, if you,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you say you're going to do something,
you know, and you put 20 down to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into a, you know, a, a mission,
a mission done and get some seeds made,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, fuck, it's going to take
40, you know, and then when you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: expect it, you get exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of at the point where I just,
I just popped seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pop and I hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that, you know,
you, you know, you can't make it happen
[SPEAKER_00]: until it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, you just don't force
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't, you know, this
industry doesn't need any more force
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you know, and, you know,
I tell a lot of people, dude, keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking day job, you know, cause you know,
there's always that dude that hits you up
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to be, then they're
like, man, I'm going to be the next seed
[SPEAKER_00]: junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, right on bro,
man, you know, good luck to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't quit your day job, you know,
and, and, you know, I, I think if a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people did this just for fun or whatever,
you know, then end game would be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the, the people that don't
smoke pot and breed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can't even give descriptions of
what the hell they're working with or what
[SPEAKER_00]: they have or, or, or what to expect,
man, you know, I mean, at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're going to oblige somebody
with a, with a prediction, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, you know, a lot of people say
that, you know, a good breeder just can
[SPEAKER_00]: predict the outcome to an extent of what
you're going to find in his packs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we all have to be able to do
that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just taking responsibility for what
you're making, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just knowing what you're working
with in the first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you, you don't just pop and make,
you have to know what you're working with
[SPEAKER_04]: to see if it's worth breeding within the
first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is guys that are picking
up other guys's F threes and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, making F boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you know, we know these are
actual F jams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call them industry F jams because I,
but I'll just let you guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what an actual filial gen
is, but we'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guys that are taking these packs,
they've, they've never, never ran any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these Northern whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never ran great baby for these
granddaddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're making fucking the next
generation of seeds with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, dude, you, you've never
smoked real GDP in your whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're making granddaddy hurt
things right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One pack of 10 seats, you know,
even less, you know, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that needs to just go away,
you know, but, but back to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, oh wait, you know, I, I tested
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I beat the shit out of everything out,
crossed it to a few more things and then
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually made the F twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually fit almost seven years
for me to make the F threes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I grew a lot of them and
I thought it was just like one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: coolest, the coolest crosses I had ever
grown, but I couldn't figure out where to
[SPEAKER_00]: take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of realized, man,
there's no need to really take anything
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I'm, I'm, I'm kind of an anti
bottleneck guy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm more into, you know,
I'm more into four males in two females,
[SPEAKER_00]: all on the same gene frequency,
you know, like a micro population of
[SPEAKER_00]: similar plants where you know,
I can call some stuff I don't want out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more, more suspense features or,
or, or whatnot, you know, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm aiming for a, an Indica,
I mean, I shouldn't be really necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some plants in my pool of
plants I have to use, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I called the whole time and you
know, try to get myself down to a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: size micro pool, you know, have a larger
population and then grow those flower
[SPEAKER_00]: them, do what I need to do and then take
those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can actually, you know,
make a generation of seeds and feel
[SPEAKER_00]: confident about what I'm putting on the
table, what everything has to offer,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've seen, what to expect,
you know, just, just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't have a big tester for,
you know, so, you know, for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just, you know, sometimes easier to
do it myself and that's kind of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: slowed me down this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really haven't done anything for drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I've just been, been finding
the plants I want to work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, stuff that inspires me versus just,
you know, currency, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, I, I do okay enough
that I don't need to make seeds for a
[SPEAKER_00]: living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing wrong with that,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of everybody's good enough to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a ton of guys doing it and
fucking props to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a part-time thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I realized that for me,
that it kind of, we came about the money
[SPEAKER_00]: for a split second and I, I kind of
realized that, you know, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause every breeder, boy, you get your
first drop in and it's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a fucking three balls eyes
or a fucking running a table, a nine ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, you get adrenaline
pumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, you know, people paid for
my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm somebody, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jeff, that can turn you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can turn you quick, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so I just, I just kind of slowed
down and I'm just trying to kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to just, I'm trying to find the
one, you know, I w I would love to hit a
[SPEAKER_00]: male to 20 plants, you know, but if I
don't have that male and I don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 plants, man, I'm, I'm in idle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I guess you could say I got
writer's block at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm just, I'm just going through
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you find the right plants to do
what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can, I can sympathize with the
writer's block thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit's for real, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the fucking runs came around,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, runs is worthless to me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke runs and it's just like,
dude, man, this is, this is like not even
[SPEAKER_00]: practice weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even smoke this just,
just to practice smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, man, that was kind of
uninspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as that went, I just, I didn't,
you know, I, I, I thought, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a slice cream cake, which was,
you know, sour, layered ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, that was as far into
gelato as I, I wanted to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ice cream cake, you know, the,
the cut that I had was, was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put up huge numbers, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 38%, you know, with everything
and, you know, the Washington state
[SPEAKER_00]: standards, you know, but it still goes
back to that star fighter thing where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hollow, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the cams, I like the diesels,
I like the OGs and the, the, the crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: of all three, because they, they get you
in the gut, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like getting a ride in a
fast car, the torque, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that feeling of helplessness,
you know, I can smoke some good cam and
[SPEAKER_00]: just get up and move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even have to think,
I don't have to fucking move my legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just walk themselves, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's what I like,
you know, I don't want to have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I said, go through and,
and, you know, especially with me having
[SPEAKER_00]: hypermesis, you know, I can't smoke a
large quantity of fucking pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, you know, from the,
from one episode when I start throwing up
[SPEAKER_00]: and it stops, you know, I usually wait 10
days before I start smoking again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should probably be two months,
but you know, I'm right on the clock again
[SPEAKER_00]: for it happening again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, my tolerance is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can get through the day with a
fucking gram dude, a flower and I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking set, you know, like ready for bed,
fucking bloodshot eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that, that day I was
fucking high all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to fucking move my legs to
take a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fucking moving, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, I, I, I really got
into the sour layer free stuff because it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it, it, it had a high level of
mercine and humulene in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was, it did great as far
as medically, you know, so it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just, it was a win-win,
you know, and that was my last,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, big male, you know, the big,
the big one I worked and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably crossed to 15 females,
probably close to, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just kind of at a point when elite
was out that last time and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bugging me, I just felt like, dude,
I, I, I want to completely remove myself
[SPEAKER_00]: from anything to do with you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every, every time he got out and say,
you know, can I get some, can I get a
[SPEAKER_00]: package?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was one, it's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just, he, he just never just,
he never quit, you know, so it sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the thing with this shit too,
like if we're being real, like all of his
[SPEAKER_04]: early shit, like none of it was
consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could buy two packs with one name on
it and be completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because he was using like Bubba and OG
early on, like most of it was pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: decent compared to what other people were
putting out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But trying to figure out what shit really
was in your packs was fucking impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him that at a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, he, he'd hit me up
and say stuff like, oh, dude, you must be
[SPEAKER_00]: rich from using my stuff in your gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's like, it's like,
dude, for real, dude, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and yeah, it just, you know,
he got weird and there's all this late
[SPEAKER_00]: night messages and it's just like,
man, this dude's fucking out, but he's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking going to be back in soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just, I just finally told
him, it's just like, fuck you weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I just need to remove myself
from his gear basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I ended up making the chemi
fucking sours and that was pretty much my,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, equivalent to the, to the 08s,
you know, I'm, I'm done with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of my hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be making more, but you know,
I can at least have a platform of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, but actual cam cuts with what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Provenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it was, you know,
I used Skunk VA dog patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there it is, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, you know, my equivalent to the
whole way, probably a little more Indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was a lot of, a lot of,
you know, 10 and 11 week stuff in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in elites 08, you know, and I'm noticing
in these chemi fucking sours, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know, eight and a half,
nine and a half, and you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're out, you're done, you know,
so, you know, it's just, it's a better
[SPEAKER_00]: place for me, you know, so, you know,
I, and I just, you know, I'm just trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of go through right now and just,
you know, make, make another batch of as
[SPEAKER_00]: many crosses as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a bad over my dog,
like a large, a large bag of pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I had for myself and my sons to
carry on all vacuum sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it was a, it's, I couldn't
put a price on that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I had a bag that if I ever needed
to leave town in five minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the bag I was grabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had some of the old,
the lemon bubba crosses, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would Elise lemon bubba or Moda's
lemon bubba, whoever made it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they argue about it, but you know,
it's, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you going to believe Ron or Jesse,
you know, God only knows people are asking
[SPEAKER_04]: about your Mr. Whitey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound familiar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, back in the day, I, who did I
originally get them from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some, got some bubba ogres,
some bubba oak seeds in a tray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when that was made,
the bubba oak.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I want to say I got them from,
is it seeds of compassion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't he, wasn't he like a UK guy and
kind of didn't kind of work with fire
[SPEAKER_00]: stacks for a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, but you know, he was an older guy
that had been around and he, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he traded Mike a bunch of exotic,
he might trade them a bunch of exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, went through the list and
picked some stuff out and I got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, these bubba ogres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, ended up getting a mail in
there, you know, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing was I hit CSI because,
you know, at the time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was the, you know, he was the new FEM
guy on the block and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, okay, there's anybody to talk
to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's you, you know, he says,
he says, nope, nope, no possible way,
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's contamination, you know,
uh, you know, those aren't white bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: ogres and blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, you know, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up running into him in a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and actually like blazing past,
uh, archive like, like, Hey, nice to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: you, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, you know, running over to
fucking inspector, you know, dude off,
[SPEAKER_00]: but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and, you know, I mean,
you know, I've been reading up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there is a one in a million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does happen, you know, and,
and, you know, it's possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, you know, he, he, he couldn't
argue it, you know, at a point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I grew a ton of them out
because I was really, really wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: about it because of the fact, you know,
you just, you just don't have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: goods there to make a mail, you know,
and, and we grew a population of a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: of them out, uh, over here at this house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, that was actually where a
mail came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Mike used in some of his crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think he, he released like eight
strains with, with that mail, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: an absolute white dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up, I crossed the bubble,
uh, bubble over mail to the white,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, forum cut cookies because it was right
around 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was rocking the forum cut predator
painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberry kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I did, we, uh,
have a guy out here to 10 beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped me a little bit a while back
and, uh, he had gotten this cut of
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberry kush down in Pendleton,
Oregon, which, you know, Pendleton,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon has no relation to work and kid at
all, you know, by, you know, by,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what I know about Ken and where
he grew up and whatnot, but it was Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: kids, Blackberry kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's no disputing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was the, it was the small
fucker that liked to grow out sideways and
[SPEAKER_00]: throw those three bladed leaves down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it would, it would put on
some nice purple color and it had great
[SPEAKER_00]: frost, but same star fighter complex where
it just didn't, it wasn't any kind of full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum high or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to smoke more in 20
minutes, you know, it's that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that type of weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, I, I messed around with
those for a long time and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out multiples and, you know,
I think I ended up sending an inspector
[SPEAKER_00]: back a bunch of pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not sure, but, you know,
I talked about with a bunch of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, other breeders and sending them
pictures of all my findings and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're like, you know,
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're, dude, you have white
dawn plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have bubba dawn plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have that classic ogre
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, big bush with, you know,
nine and 11 bladed, you know, leaves on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything slumped over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go back to IC mag, somebody had
a couple of pictures of the S ones and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the actual ogres cut over there,
you know, and, you know, you, you would
[SPEAKER_00]: see that as well, you know, I think more
so than anything actually, there was more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, classic ogres in there than,
than anything, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, yeah, I brought those out
for a while, made a few crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I know one cut was in Colorado and did
35% THC back about, oh shit, probably six
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's just one that got
eaten by the dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one that I probably had 30 of
those left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I always try to, if I'm fond of
something, I want to give it the time it
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I hoard a lot of seeds that I make
because it's just not the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's not the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, I just, I really want to
work these, but it's just, I've got other
[SPEAKER_00]: shit on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can't, you know, give it 150%,
I can't fuck with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole bag was stuffed like that and
they ate the whole bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a pack of, you know,
star fighter F twos, which I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollar offer for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was old rascal gear in there and it
was, it was a big bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was last, last Halloween.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of remember when all this happened
because I remember you busting out the old
[SPEAKER_04]: rascal gear and I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, that gave me a big
pile of just floor hash seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did end up sending all those to
Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we've identified a few
definite plants out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, I had a sour Larry to a
Zeus cut to some of the ultimate SFB camp
[SPEAKER_00]: that Carmen had given me a bunch of packs
back in the day to run through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me the ultimate SFB camp,
which is a completely different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, I'd say the chemo weight,
you know, was a nice sour cam in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the SFB camp has a lot of,
he, he said he put a swerves SFB BX in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that was crossed to supposedly an
AFI BX, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do get a lot of really short stubby
leaf, the Afghani traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, those would be the sweet plants
that are in the bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, they're actually really cool
because you, you get some of the SFB too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of, it kind of equates to like
a, almost like a piney, like a piney cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get, I get piney cams out of there
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there's, you know, it, it,
it, it was really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really wish I would have made
more, more seeds of it, but I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I had two females out of the
packs and they both mannered late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, it's just that the late
flowering manners are so just unappealing
[SPEAKER_04]: to me, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can ruin whole fucking crops and a
bunch of preemie seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, just, just,
just look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at it, you know, I just,
you know, I, I, hey, I love some can of
[SPEAKER_00]: beans, you know, but don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that, you know, nanner late or
whatever, but you know, compared to back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day when we had some, I remember
Mike had this Apollo 13 from Subcool and
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing threw down, you know,
would throw down a pound of plant easily
[SPEAKER_00]: by itself in a five gallon pot,
you know, with just pro mix in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top to bottom and fricking little sterile
manners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I, I couldn't look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that, you know, I hate to say it,
but you know, a lot of that Space Queen
[SPEAKER_00]: Dom Subcool gear just was not in my
wheelhouse, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that was the biggest complaint
from everyone is all the Space Queen
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, fucking room rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I was, I've always been a
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Moray guy, you know, that's,
that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's where my palette is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the effect that I desire in
process is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it just, it everything works
out the best, you know, I, I have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that I work, you know, the mid
juleps, you know, or whatnot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least has the kosher in it and it packs
a punch and, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has good frost with the, you know,
hate to say it, the star fighter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: deep down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the kosher still gives it legs,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I enjoy smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good daytime smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I'm an indica guy
100%, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke and feel the effect and
relax and calm the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So talking about the reverse males,
so me and Inspector have gone back and
[SPEAKER_04]: forth on that ever since we've known each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, we're stupid friends because
I've seen what looks like males appear
[SPEAKER_04]: from pure S1 lines where I know they
weren't contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the end, what we kind of came to the
conclusion of, when these things were
[SPEAKER_04]: tested, sex tested, they would test
female, but they were expressing all male.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a rare occurrence, but it definitely
can happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really got to see it yet,
but I have heard of them expressing or
[SPEAKER_00]: masking or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: With cannabis plants, it's really easy to
see with a reversal spray because you
[SPEAKER_04]: could reverse a fem line that is all
female, reverse it, and make it turn male.
[SPEAKER_04]: So manipulating any kind of hormones can
make something express 100% male,
[SPEAKER_04]: even if there's not male chromosomes,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how could I get true males from
across to the white?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I cross that Bubba Odors to the white,
and then those offspring had males in
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't be more than maybe one or two
males per hundred, but it would just be
[SPEAKER_04]: females expressing male as opposed to just
being genetically male.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just look like males,
but genetically they're female,
[SPEAKER_04]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is a weird fucking plant,
and a lot of times people put human,
[SPEAKER_04]: think about human type genetics on it,
where things are definitely male,
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely female, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have something with all female
chromosomes express male, which it's rare,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it happens, and it can happen for
thousands of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, long term though, will progeny of
that false male contain males?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, usually.
[SPEAKER_04]: For whatever reason, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it, and the longer it's worked back,
it will slowly gain more males in its
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that's the other hard part that
we've never figured out scientifically why
[SPEAKER_04]: that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been the longest process just from
when I first started reversing plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: noticed that males were popping up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, people are like, no,
no, no, no, pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, but this is one in a thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: How am I getting one in a thousand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fought it for a long time trying to
figure it out, tighten up rooms,
[SPEAKER_04]: figure it out, and it is complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's way more complicated than just pollen
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the people who sell packs that
are half male, half female, and from a
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse pack, that's pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it myself on accident thinking
that I knew what I was talking about and
[SPEAKER_04]: sold pollen contamination, but oddly
enough, it looked like both the parents,
[SPEAKER_04]: which always fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran through a ton of those extra whites,
a few runs of the Blackberry Bub Ogres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get any kind of scientific
evaluation or anything using cookies in
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't give any good info on that,
but yeah, it was really bizarre seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: males and like I said, chopping it up with
Caleb and just walking away stupider than
[SPEAKER_00]: I was before in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you have it figured out,
and it's like, oh.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, man, that was about 2013,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to go back into those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some Mr. White's Ultimate Cams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, I'm pickling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. White's Ultimate Cams, and I think
I still have Mr. White's The White.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get every pack, but I'd be
damned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were certain breeders they just
liked the packaging on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Team, they loved his labels,
but they didn't eat any of the packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had like 10 tore up Green Team packs,
and then they didn't get into the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: containers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 100 seeds down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was a rough one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where are you at now?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your newest muse?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you just kind of, like you said,
stuck on Roger Block?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back into these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a towering Inferno I made with the
NorCal Fire OG, the Ultimate SFB Cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Released a few packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made F3s, but just a small, just
personal pack type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going through those, and I would
like to make the next gen of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm down to like these, like I said in
those Ultimate SFB Cams, about one,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say two and 10, I'm getting these
short little F3s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're happy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of the population is a really
stretchy Chemo G headband plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just wants you to clean the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just keep pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll look next to it, and here's
this little 150 yard marker that's a foot
[SPEAKER_00]: tall with these few little branches coming
off the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it wants to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to eliminate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, if I can just keep
working these micropopulations on these
[SPEAKER_00]: same frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can use six plants that all have that
soapy smell at the beginning of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the end, I'm getting classic
tennis ball OG and some volatile cam turps
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what I'm expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I used Relentless' 818 SFB cut
that he worked back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit that same Ultimate SFB Cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working the F2s right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some really, that Relentless cut
was just straight gasoline, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: classic gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: No ethanol in it, just classic gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really short and just really
just a terrible grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put off terrible flowers, really small,
just thumbnail size flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, wow, this thing's either,
it's either drifting or degenerating or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before she got tossed, I hit her to the
08 and the Ultimate SFB Cam as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit them to both parents because at the
time I was into this, okay, work these
[SPEAKER_00]: lines parallel, hit the white to both the
Ultimate SFB Cam and the 08.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have two white cam lines
and tweak it either way, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you find in these two lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of trying to shoot out six OGs
all in the same path and working into the
[SPEAKER_00]: best cam OG I could by manipulating
whatever was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of what I'm doing now is
playing with those 818s, both of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the SFB one and then the 818 going,
going through those pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just trying to just keep furthering
the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go too overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working that sour Larry from BX1,
BX2, BX2, F2, BX2, IX, it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a lot of fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get why guys don't want to,
they want to keep it moving and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: different flavors coming in and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, dude, that's a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every plant's a fucking rainbow,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, especially in the early
days with it, I mean, it was like classic
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking gold mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were sifting through rocks to find
gold nuggets, more so than now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody had stepped their game
up and there's a lot of good strains out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where guys are pulling good
numbers, five out of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five out of ten females or whatever,
you know, approved and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are finding keepers and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not long-term keepers, I'm noticing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I think that the definition of
keepers has changed so much that I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know that they're finding keepers that we
would have considered back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are Instagram appropriate and
more resinous, therefore, they're easier
[SPEAKER_04]: to label keepers, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not, keepers are chosen on
Instagram by pictures, not necessarily by
[SPEAKER_04]: the quality of the smoke, the complexity
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me green weed any day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where I'm at, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I liked animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought for a cookies cross,
that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I've had a few, but for the
most part, man, I still like anything free
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the exception, man, I can't dog on it
too hard, but you know, we smoked a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights here, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one I wouldn't care if I ever
saw it again, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, people got tired of NL up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you either smoke B-C weed or you
smoke NL there for a while, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had two choices, and in the fall,
you know, this was around, shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: late 90s, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either smoking Lights or you're
smoking, you know, we call it Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: bacon, and we could still get the,
every fall from Cali, we'd get the
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas Bud up here, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only in small amounts, you know,
and we literally just knew somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: brought enough to take care of like 10
friends, you know, and you put your order
[SPEAKER_00]: in on like the 4th of July and,
you know, had your fingers crossed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's changed, you know,
these, you know, it used to be hard to get
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts and seeds and fuck, you know,
it's a whole new world, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new ballpark for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still believe there's plenty of
fucking, you know, legendary giants in all
[SPEAKER_00]: those old seeds, man, and, you know,
I think a lot of people need to just step
[SPEAKER_00]: back and, you know, work on resurrecting
something that you know and like and can
[SPEAKER_00]: work with and call your own and whatnot,
and, you know, put the pedal to the metal
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, you know, cross it to 20
different things, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need 10 guys all making the same
crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's getting old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, we see it,
you know, everybody went orange for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, then, you know, everybody was
trying to go, you know, cookies and then
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden, everybody was going sour
and then, you know, it's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I understand it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the wheel is never going to stop
turning, but, you know, we can at least
[SPEAKER_00]: try to reinvent some things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have on your plate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you working with?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing the NL projects right now with
CSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some other stuff that we're going
to start a company with mutant stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have some blue Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did pop some of the Blue Max just to
take the light a little bit forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the punchy bluster, which is the,
it's all blue bonnet stuff mostly just
[SPEAKER_04]: because I loved it so much, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else you want to talk
about before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a privilege, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, man, back in the day,
dude, I fucking looked up to you and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking a lot of other dudes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you having me on and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great meeting you down at CDX and
shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also love little boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've always been super, super fucking
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for coming on.
Likewise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again to Thunderfudge for stopping
by.
[SPEAKER_04]: He really is a fucking cool dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had the privilege of hanging out with
him, smoking with him, fucking shooting
[SPEAKER_04]: the shit in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, y'all.
