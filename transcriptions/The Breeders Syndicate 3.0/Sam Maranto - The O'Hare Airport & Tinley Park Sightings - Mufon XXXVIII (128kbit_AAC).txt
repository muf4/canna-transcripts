[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that woke you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next speaker, Sam Maranto,
is the state director for MUFON Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early this year, the euphological
community, if that's even a word,
[SPEAKER_00]: was rocked by a headline about a UFO
sighting over Chicago, the O'Hare airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: What made this so interesting was the
amount of traffic that this one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: story attracted from the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the stats were well over a
million hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the history of Chicagotribune.com,
no story had ever pulled that traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody tells you there's no
interest in UFOs, I think that's proof
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam Maranto is an investigative researcher
who goes out into the field, researches
[SPEAKER_00]: not only the O'Hare sighting, but many
sightings even outside of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me welcome to the stage Mr. Sam
Maranto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time I've ever said
Maestro, hit it, and MUFON, Maestro,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Snappy little ditty, isn't that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I figure if Michael Shermer could
bring his toys to the Larry King Show,
[SPEAKER_10]: I could bring a little music to MUFON
Symposium.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's some serious lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm going to be talking about today
is the O'Hare incident.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to cover a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'm going to be covering a little
about an incident in my backyard,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is the area known as Tinley Park.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had a series of sightings out
there, mass sightings back in 2004.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also going to jump into the
correlation with other sightings in and
[SPEAKER_10]: about those times in other states.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also going to show you some footage that I
think is some of the most remarkable
[SPEAKER_10]: footage from each of these events.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'd like to do is first give you a
little bit of information about the O'Hare
[SPEAKER_10]: incident.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, anybody here never hear of
the O'Hare incident?
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_10]: Never heard about it?
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been in Papua New Guinea recently.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because this went viral.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, within a short period of time
after this story broke January 1st by John
[SPEAKER_10]: Hilkovich and the Chicago Tribune,
that story went on the wire as before he
[SPEAKER_10]: was able to pop the cork on his champagne
that New Year's Eve, or New Year's,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, New Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_10]: By the 2nd of January, it was literally
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in international press.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was doing interviews, in fact,
on the 1st for stations down in Australia.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, we're going to show you some footage
from actually YouTube, and a few other
[SPEAKER_10]: things from CLTV, where the story actually
was aired for the first time.
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually talked about it the Friday
before the 1st, and the interview is
[SPEAKER_10]: pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also going to show you some footage
of the interview on CNN of an actual
[SPEAKER_10]: individual that was there at the ramp,
one of these ramp rats, or else,
[SPEAKER_10]: was it the ramp ramp?
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them, or else the pilot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, we're going to see a little fox
piece that I was involved with,
[SPEAKER_10]: and show you the quality difference in
some of these.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, if we can run the first video DVD,
and hopefully we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Jim.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fine, thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's preening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Busy with this UFO stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see it hit the Fox crawl Monday
night?
[SPEAKER_12]: Did it?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just been everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I've been on CNN.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my fourth appearance today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_12]: MSNBC, every network.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_12]: And just worldwide.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Australia, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're going to start off.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say, John, the response has
been, well, out of this world,
[SPEAKER_06]: hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, where's the latest on the
investigation, the FAA?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going on, actually, before it's
actually here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, United is now acknowledging that
they were approached by employees.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, they've done that flip-flop,
and I'm trying to locate photos of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm told there may be photos.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, really?
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: He sweats like a bear.
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm told that the story on CT has almost a
million hits.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's the most read story in the
history of CT.com.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're kidding me.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I got an email yesterday from Villa
Dee.
[SPEAKER_12]: There were one million hits on their
website.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and this was the entire history of
the website.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, does it possibly exist?
[SPEAKER_06]: You might get the pictures and get them in
for tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I'm told the pilots on that plane
that was being pushed back, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: I said in the story that they opened the
windscreen and stuck their head out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I'm being told that one of them had a
digital camera and snapped some pictures.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, United is not playing ball with me,
and FAA, I've expanded my FOIA to include
[SPEAKER_12]: the flight plan, which might include the
pilot's names.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm trying to work with the union as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they still going by weather
phenomenon?
[SPEAKER_12]: FAA, you know, pretty much because of the
federal holiday, I haven't talked to them
[SPEAKER_12]: that much.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, they haven't changed their
story.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've just heard from other people since
then that that explanation just doesn't
[SPEAKER_12]: wash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they haven't gone out of their way to
say anything otherwise so far?
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I mean, they say, you know,
it was November 7th.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're moving on.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just doing their daily thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I tell you what, all the people who
saw it must be feeling a little validated
[SPEAKER_06]: right about now, huh?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, and I'm getting tons of emails
from other people who, outside the airport
[SPEAKER_12]: as well as at O'Hare, who also either
sighted that same object or saw the hole
in the sky.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had to go to the sauna after that
just to clear the rest of those pores out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what did it look like,
again, to the folks who saw it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a saucer-like object hovering over
the United terminal, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, directly over Gate C.
[SPEAKER_12]: 17, and it was stationary in the sky,
dark gray metallic, you know, like I say,
[SPEAKER_12]: saucer-shaped, no lights.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was there for some minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when it disappeared, it just
streaked through the clouds with such
[SPEAKER_12]: energy that it broke a big blue hole in
the overcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the hole remained there for several
minutes until the wind drifted and pushed
[SPEAKER_12]: the clouds back together.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll cover a little information on that,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the blue was the sky.
[SPEAKER_12]: But otherwise, the entire skyline was
cloudy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally overcast, huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I forgot that spot over there.
[SPEAKER_12]: An airplane just doesn't react like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It slices through, and it doesn't disturb
the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: At this point, he's looking for his
next... Do you have an interview set up
[SPEAKER_10]: after this?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm going back on a radio station,
a couple of radio stations this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Headline News has a show.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing it at 3 o'clock.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I'll have to watch if I'm... Yeah,
we'll have to set by then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Australia, what other international?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, hearing from people in Ireland,
they say, you know, we heard about what's
[SPEAKER_12]: happening at O'Hara.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's O'Hara?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, just...
Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: As well as serious, you know, researchers
at major U.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: universities who have attempted to do
their own investigations.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when they go to the government to try
to get information, they get snowballed.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there really is this universal feeling
that the government knows a lot more than
[SPEAKER_12]: it's willing to tell them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I find interesting is, would they say
that otherwise if it wasn't so candidly,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, done here?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to play... What I found
interesting is John Hilkovich... I am
[SPEAKER_10]: so...
[SPEAKER_10]: See how he presents this right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was the first one to get to talk to you
about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: The UFO hair story the Chicago Tribune
exclusively broke on New Year's Day is
[SPEAKER_06]: garnering attention around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining us now to talk about it once again
is Tribune transportation writer John
[SPEAKER_06]: Hilkovich, who broke the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, John, the response has been,
well, out of this world, hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it has been astronomical,
Jim.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every major country, it seems.
[SPEAKER_12]: People have written in both those who
claims they've spotted UFOs during their
[SPEAKER_12]: life, as well as serious researchers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, just the last two days,
this is my email.
[SPEAKER_12]: And these are the serious emails.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the ones from Cooke's who said
they were brought aboard alien spacecraft,
[SPEAKER_12]: I put in a circular file.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just a story that has legs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And people are fascinated by the thoughts.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's some belief that there
are advances in life forms that are
[SPEAKER_12]: visiting us here on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been contacted now in the last few
days by several countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that also includes serious university
researchers here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've got to tell you,
too, I got a call from my dad in
[SPEAKER_06]: California Monday night.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, what is up with the O'Hare
UFO story?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, where did you see that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did you read that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was on Fox Network's crawl at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just amazing how much this is
garnering.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_12]: And worldwide attention, as you say.
[SPEAKER_12]: And from people who have observed made
observations themselves, including on
[SPEAKER_12]: November 7th, the date of this incident,
additional people both at O'Hare and
[SPEAKER_12]: outside the airport who have either seen
this gray, disc-shaped metallic object
[SPEAKER_12]: themselves, or they saw that huge hole in
the sky that the object created when it
[SPEAKER_12]: vanished.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go over that one more time.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do people see when it all of a sudden
vanished right through the clouds over the
[SPEAKER_06]: United Terminal?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then how's the FAA been reacting the
past few days, too?
[SPEAKER_06]: Any new ground on that?
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the object was hovering in a
stationary position about 1,500 feet above
[SPEAKER_12]: the United Terminal for some minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when it left, it just burst
through this thick cloud layer,
[SPEAKER_12]: creating a large open space of a blue sky
on an otherwise overcast day.
[SPEAKER_12]: It took some minutes for that opening to
close up when the clouds drifted back
[SPEAKER_12]: together.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just extremely unusual,
according to the witnesses.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, airplanes just don't react like
this.
[SPEAKER_12]: They slice through clouds, and they really
don't disturb the atmosphere that much,
[SPEAKER_12]: except for the wingtips and such.
[SPEAKER_12]: The FAA is still pinning this to some kind
of weather phenomenon that some lights
[SPEAKER_12]: from the airport at the overcast sky
somehow got together and created this
[SPEAKER_12]: image.
[SPEAKER_12]: But weather experts, astronomy experts,
others that I've talked to said that
[SPEAKER_12]: that's bunk.
[SPEAKER_12]: That explanation just doesn't wash.
[SPEAKER_12]: United, on the other hand, after first
denying that they got any reports from
[SPEAKER_12]: employees about this sighting,
is now saying, yes, indeed, their
[SPEAKER_12]: employees did.
[SPEAKER_12]: They did approach them immediately because
of concerns about safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to reiterate, John, the witnesses who
originally came to you are all-season
[SPEAKER_06]: professional, credible professionals like
pilots who saw this.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're pilots.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're senior managers.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're mechanics and others.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they are very truthful about what
they're saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're trying to locate photographs,
if they do exist, of this incident.
[SPEAKER_06]: John, we know you have plenty of other
interviews to do today with other
[SPEAKER_06]: countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll let you go, and we'll keep our
eyes to the sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jim.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the conversation still rolls to black.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it amazing what really garners
people's, for various reasons,
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_06]: How cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to see in a week where this
stands.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just amazed I'm still getting requests
for interviews because.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, wasn't that insightful?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, John.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Jim.
[SPEAKER_10]: We run the second part, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from CNN.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do they come from other worlds?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't believe this was possibly your
imagination?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely not my imagination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe was a mechanic for United Airlines
while taxiing a jumbo jet to the hangar.
[SPEAKER_09]: He and another mechanic looked out the
window in the general direction and
[SPEAKER_09]: noticed an object up in the sky,
dark gray object.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sitting above the terminal complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe, which is not his real name,
is one of several airport workers,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of whom have talked to the Chicago
Tribune, who say they saw a saucer-shaped
[SPEAKER_02]: UFO hovering just beneath the clouds at
the airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the first to go on camera to talk
about it since this happened several weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're sure it was some kind of object
that normally would not be above O'Hare
[SPEAKER_02]: Airport?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been at O'Hare for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's just say that I've never seen an
object in my time there that looked like
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looked like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll tell you, definitely it was not
an airplane as we know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could be an airplane as another
world knows it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_09]: We brought in one of Chicago's top sketch
artists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Followed the contours of the object.
[SPEAKER_02]: To listen to Joe and draw a picture of
what he says he saw.
[SPEAKER_09]: More like an oval.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark gray oval.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because no photos have surfaced and Joe
doesn't know of any.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it didn't say Goodyear on it,
did it?
[SPEAKER_09]: No Goodyear, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a really good drawing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what it looks like?
[SPEAKER_09]: Very much so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there is the object that most people
who have seen this footage say was the
[SPEAKER_10]: object.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was a cell picture.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how much darker they can get
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's up in, let me point it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's right up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: See it?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the object.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was actually sent anonymously to
Above Top Secret, which is a very good
[SPEAKER_10]: website and blog.
[SPEAKER_10]: The thread on this was I don't know how
many pages.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in fact my witness that came forward
that is also you'll see included in the
[SPEAKER_10]: NARCAP report.
[SPEAKER_10]: And NARCAP was actually field this case.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why of course is Richard Haynes
is known for dealing with aviation.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a very busy personnel.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this was really important that this was
field to him.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was able to do some work interview this
individual and strangely enough my format
[SPEAKER_10]: has changed because I was actually
supposed to come here today with two sets
[SPEAKER_10]: of footage that never materialized.
[SPEAKER_10]: Up until the last moment I was guaranteed
I was going to have them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to progress now if we can to an
interview that we did with Fox in and
[SPEAKER_10]: about this time.
[SPEAKER_10]: that I think took on an entirely different
tone from these, and I'd like your
[SPEAKER_10]: interpretation of it or your opinion
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we move to the next segment on this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it possible?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm crossing my fingers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting nowhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is another segment, a Fox piece,
but evidently we have some technical
[SPEAKER_10]: difficulties.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody tap me in the back of the head or
send me a pigeon with a letter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, we'll give you some information
about the O'Hare case and where it finally
[SPEAKER_10]: ended up.
[SPEAKER_10]: The final report, which is 155 pages,
you can actually see that and download it
[SPEAKER_10]: at narcap.org, N-A-R-C-A-P dot org,
and when you go there, go to the left-hand
[SPEAKER_10]: side of the page and it'll say the O'Hare
report.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was posted August 27th.
[SPEAKER_10]: In there, you'll see the compiled
information from FOIA.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the O'Hare request, which actually
were fulfilled, but they did not come in
[SPEAKER_10]: simultaneously, but trickled in a little
bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting in that request was also some
radar footage, about 14 minutes that are
[SPEAKER_10]: missing, and would have been pretty
important, but didn't happen, and here we
[SPEAKER_10]: go back to this piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: To the west off I-88, this man snapped a
photo of it as he drove to his home in
[SPEAKER_08]: Westmont.
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of looked like it took a building
and knocked it over, and it was flying
[SPEAKER_07]: around.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to the south in Tilley Park.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got it on tape.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has perplexed TJ Jabcon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I turned around and I looked up and
I'm like, no way.
[SPEAKER_08]: No way.
[SPEAKER_08]: For nearly six years.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're back.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you like that?
[SPEAKER_10]: I look like a troll.
[SPEAKER_10]: They put this thing right next to my head.
[SPEAKER_10]: My cat bit my hand the day before.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're showing the holes in my hand like
I'm some sort of drug addict or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are not crackpots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone through this probably about 10
times.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's airplanes along with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfectly transformed.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when you're like, wow, what is this
thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: No noise at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a hoax.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a hoax being perpetrated on people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark Hammergren believes these lights are
nothing more than... Flares suspended
[SPEAKER_14]: below weatherblends.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody wants to say to people that there's
no Santa Claus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hammergren also has bad news for Linda Von
Henke and her family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Waiting for it to either come on down or
take me on up or whatever it wants to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's breathtaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the planet Venus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then there's this guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: They told me I'm nuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Asking to remain anonymous even though he
too insists what he saw was a UFO.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you any know any big giant square
rectangular looking blimps that move like
[SPEAKER_07]: with the speed of a fighter plane?
[SPEAKER_13]: Humans make extraordinarily poor
witnesses.
[SPEAKER_13]: They misperceive them.
Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_08]: But some people like Chicagoan Mike Ernst
refuse to back down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is this craft, this UFO.
[SPEAKER_08]: His sighting was at O'Hare as well,
six years ago when he was working the
[SPEAKER_08]: graveyard shift cleaning airplanes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like a metallic silver.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about 80 to 100 feet long,
70 feet off the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had these real bright lights coming
from within.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so close that I could have grabbed
a rock and I could have hit the darn
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of a sudden it just accelerated
and gone it went.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's cameras everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: The FAA has to have pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not making it up.
[SPEAKER_14]: There has not been one piece of physical
evidence that has passed the scientific
[SPEAKER_14]: test, but they still believe I saw what I
saw period.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can't control it, kill it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or conceal it.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, entirely you have to deny it in the
end.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it really matter whether or not these
UFO sightings can be explained away?
[SPEAKER_08]: After all, wouldn't that take away all the
mystery, the intrigue and the fun of it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark Saxon Meyer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fox News, Chicago.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish that would have happened earlier
actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was an interesting piece.
[SPEAKER_10]: He led the piece with this lady obviously
looking in Venus, and everybody in this
[SPEAKER_10]: room knew that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who this person was,
never talked to her.
[SPEAKER_10]: Second person he talked to actually saw an
advertising banner that's usually seen in
[SPEAKER_10]: the downtown Chicago along the lakefront.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very large banner that's either
pulled by a helicopter or a plane.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's big.
[SPEAKER_10]: This he could cut.
[SPEAKER_10]: We could kill this piece here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop the video DVD.
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like he's getting eaten by
something.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what happened there.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was actually the full interview by
Mark Saxon Meyer from Fox of the
[SPEAKER_10]: witnesses, those two witnesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what happened was the piece was
supposed to play out differently as I was
[SPEAKER_10]: told.
[SPEAKER_10]: We planned for this about three to four
weeks in advance.
[SPEAKER_10]: We spent a couple weeks getting everybody
lined up, and not all the witnesses showed
[SPEAKER_10]: up for the shoot.
[SPEAKER_10]: The tone of that shoot for Fox was
supposed to be very serious.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not supposed to be like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one individual you've seen that was
talking about the O'Hare incident of 2001
[SPEAKER_10]: in April was very convincing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I met his family.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe this gentleman to be very
earnest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Funny thing is, his last name is Ernst.
[SPEAKER_10]: A hell of a guy, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: He remembers this entire sighting very
vividly because, as he says, it was up
[SPEAKER_10]: close and personal.
[SPEAKER_10]: He could have thrown a rock at it maybe 60
feet away.
[SPEAKER_10]: There were four other people with him,
but that wasn't everybody that witnessed
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: He knew there were other people and other
hangers looking at it and just didn't talk
[SPEAKER_10]: to them afterwards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sightings around O'Hare are really not
something unique or new.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe our first sighting in O'Hare was
in the 50s, and it was part of Blue Book
[SPEAKER_10]: that at least recorded.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing about this sighting at O
'Hare, and I'm trying to cover a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: material, mind you now, this condensed
version is 155 pages long.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you get a chance, please read it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to give you the bottom lines and
everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, what we're looking at is
something truly unusual, truly anomalous.
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly, many people seen it,
and it was photographed.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was photographed, and some photographs,
I believe, that did come forward,
[SPEAKER_10]: at least one of them, may very well be a
legitimate photograph, but since we don't
[SPEAKER_10]: have anybody tied to it coming forward,
we don't accept that as evidence.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, we at MUFON take a very rigid
stance on what is evidence, and same thing
[SPEAKER_10]: at NARCAP, but one individual,
one witness that we spoke to, or I spoke
[SPEAKER_10]: to, I think she gave some very good
insight, and if you don't mind listening
[SPEAKER_10]: to some audio from my interview with this
person, I think it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we start the audio, please?
[SPEAKER_10]: She's confirming the fact that photos were
taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we
[SPEAKER_10]: stop for one second?
[SPEAKER_10]: What she's saying is we're looking at an
object with softer edges, not quite the
[SPEAKER_10]: same as the hard edge UFO that we're
usually depicted in everything,
[SPEAKER_10]: spinning counterclockwise, and the other
thing about it she mentions earlier in the
[SPEAKER_10]: interview, it had some unique qualities to
it of its reflectivity that made her
[SPEAKER_10]: consider other types of components other
than metal, even possibly some type of
[SPEAKER_10]: ceramic, which was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: This lady has a background in journalism.
[SPEAKER_10]: She was a reporter.
[SPEAKER_10]: She was a TV anchor person in the
Washington area.
[SPEAKER_10]: She has an interest in the military and
military aviation, and she has a
[SPEAKER_10]: background in it because she is a
military, was referred to as a military
[SPEAKER_10]: brat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Her father was a retired, or is a retired
commander of a Navy air wing, and she
[SPEAKER_10]: knows what flies, how it flies,
and what should be up there and not be up
[SPEAKER_10]: there, and she's also seen some highly
sophisticated stealth technology.
[SPEAKER_10]: She was absolutely certain that what she
saw that day was not of this world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe a little bit more of that audio,
please.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty good right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll stop that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much enough audio right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we'll do is I'm going to show you
some footage to keep you really awake.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're going to talk about the Tinley
Park sightings.
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, what came down with the O'Hare
sighting is everything conclusive and
[SPEAKER_10]: definitive so far is at NARCAP,
and that's all I can do is direct you
[SPEAKER_10]: because there's so much material there,
you'd really have to read it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the books in front of me,
but I cannot see a thing, so I can't read
[SPEAKER_10]: the details.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'd like to do instead, show you some
footage from Tinley Park that I think
[SPEAKER_10]: you'll find rather impressive.
[SPEAKER_10]: But before we show the Tinley Park
footage, I'm going to show you some
[SPEAKER_10]: footage from Arizona, and this,
I'm going to give you some insight.
[SPEAKER_10]: August, the month of August in 2004
started with a bang.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could tell you that a lot of things
happened in 2004, as you can remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: August was the month of those major
hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Our first of the series of a five category
came on shore the 13th of August.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, on the 19th of August, we had a
craft or an object hovering over
[SPEAKER_10]: Minneapolis-St.
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul for 16 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: Six hours in a 30 knot wind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does everybody remember that one,
or did you ever hear about that?
[SPEAKER_10]: It sat up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you remember hearing about it in the
news?
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course not, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Even down in Papua New Guinea.
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't hear it there, okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: So the problem was it wasn't really
covered very well.
[SPEAKER_10]: NARCAP, I mean, not NARCAP, but New Fork
received a lot of reports.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was footage of this, and there was
also a vent that night in let's say
[SPEAKER_10]: northwest Arizona, and I'd like to show
you the object that was seen there in a 30
[SPEAKER_10]: mile an hour wind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we show that, which would be Rob's
footage?
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is from Arizona Research Group.
1A.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, where's that pigeon?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now see if I was on the radio.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what's known as radio hell.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the vantage point, this individual
was looking at this thing in the air in
[SPEAKER_10]: the 30 mile an hour wind.
[SPEAKER_10]: He described it as being not aerodynamic
by any stretch of the imagination.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pay attention now to his illuminations
around the side.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I refer to his illuminations not
lights for the purpose of illuminating,
[SPEAKER_10]: but illuminations.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the result of energy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you see this one just go on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's all around it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very un-aerodynamic, and he first
described it as being a huge battleship in
[SPEAKER_10]: the sky.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you're looking at here received UFO
footage of the year, or photograph of the
[SPEAKER_10]: year, from Jerry Pippinsite.
[SPEAKER_10]: And knowing the individual for four years,
I can assure you this is a genuine
[SPEAKER_10]: photograph, and it is something out of
this world, or at least unearthly
[SPEAKER_10]: technology.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you like that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Research coming from this area has got to
be some of the best scientific,
[SPEAKER_10]: actual scientific research.
[SPEAKER_10]: This and a few other events that happened
to this individual really propelled him to
[SPEAKER_10]: look into things that really made him,
let's say, question his reality.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you look at stuff like this,
and I don't know if anybody out here,
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there is quite a few,
have had a UFO sighting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you have one, it's hard to go back to
just your normal realm, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Things change.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for this man, things really changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also in Tinley Park, the next set of
footage I'm gonna show you, I think things
[SPEAKER_10]: really changed.
[SPEAKER_10]: The south side of Chicago, we have all
these border towns, and we could kill that
[SPEAKER_10]: footage.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually quite a bit of footage,
but I don't have permission to show a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had permission to show that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could kill that footage if you don't
mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop that footage, please.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tinley Park, anybody know the area by any
chance?
[SPEAKER_10]: Tinley Park, Illinois?
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a very populated area.
[SPEAKER_10]: To give you some idea, it is a good
demographic, it's a good cross-section of
[SPEAKER_10]: people, and it's highly populated.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, it's south of Chicago,
which is just basically an extension of
[SPEAKER_10]: the population.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is also the most illuminated area south
of the loop.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is really an illuminated area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also in that area, there's a very strange
subdivision that looks like a cyclotron,
[SPEAKER_10]: even as high as 36 miles up in the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, I've looked at it through Google,
36 miles up in the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also an auditorium, a music center
out there that looks like a huge monolith.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really bizarre the way it looks from
space.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, under the assumption that what you're
about to see is of an extraterrestrial
[SPEAKER_10]: origin, and I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't check anybody's license and pull
them out of this thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even, you know, no vehicle ID.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't see anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: But either way, the technology is
definitely unearthly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we can run TJ's footage,
and TJ's been lucky enough to actually see
[SPEAKER_10]: this twice.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had mass sightings out there in Tinley
Park on three events.
[SPEAKER_10]: This event took place two days after that
other object you saw in Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the 19th, this is the 21st.
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we kick the audio up on this?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's him breathing, and the crickets in
the background.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were having a party outside,
40 people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ozzy Osborne just got done with a concert.
[SPEAKER_10]: People were heading off on I-80,
about two miles away from there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the air and water show was earlier
that day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think my friend here gets a little
excited, huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: I got it, I got it on tape.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, what you're looking at here,
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have you speed that up,
please, to get an idea of what we're
[SPEAKER_10]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I seen this the first time,
I wanted to put it in faster motion to get
[SPEAKER_10]: an idea if there's any pattern to this,
or if they stay in any pattern,
[SPEAKER_10]: possibly being attached to something.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what we basically came up with.
[SPEAKER_10]: This, from what you will see in the next
sequence of the other sighting,
[SPEAKER_10]: which was the October 31st sighting,
and if we could forward to that,
[SPEAKER_10]: which will show up on the screen as being
850 something, you will see a plane.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the next set of footage you will see,
here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a plane going in front of this
object.
[SPEAKER_10]: The object's about a mile or more further
away from this gentleman, and a plane cuts
[SPEAKER_10]: in front of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch and see this.
[SPEAKER_10]: October 31st, 2004.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's them, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same red chariot lights as we had
before.
[SPEAKER_10]: What they see is red.
[SPEAKER_10]: Red is the wavelength that you would see,
because it's the longest wavelength.
[SPEAKER_10]: But actually, if you were very close to
it, you would see a composite of the full
[SPEAKER_10]: spectrum of our light range.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, where's that plane?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we back up?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we missed the plane going through
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, there it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a fourth one to come?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the end of the 21st of August.
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, another craft actually shows
up afterwards on each occasion.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to go a little bit ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's starting to fade.
[SPEAKER_11]: The plane's in the air.
[SPEAKER_10]: The plane's in the air.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I tell you, I'm running out of breath.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to zoom in a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're back again.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's airplanes along with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop that for a second right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: That object is from the airplane more than
half a mile away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Compare the illuminations.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you heard that astronomer say that
what this was was flares on a balloon.
[SPEAKER_10]: A flare is a rating loom of about 60.
[SPEAKER_10]: The illuminations on the airplanes are
substantially more than 60.
[SPEAKER_10]: They could be 300 or more, depending on
which lights are blinking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, when you look back there,
this object being a half a mile away,
[SPEAKER_10]: and we're looking at an airplane there,
when you know the difference of size and
[SPEAKER_10]: calculating the distance, those
illuminations are about three times the
[SPEAKER_10]: size of that airplane.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you get an idea how big this object
could be.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing is, these are at the end
of a large V or a V triangular isosceles
[SPEAKER_10]: type craft.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very large.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 21st, we actually have footage of
objects coming in and out of this object.
[SPEAKER_10]: The object you're looking back,
you're looking at in the background is
[SPEAKER_10]: over 3,000 feet long.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know where on earth we build
things like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: You can run that a little bit more,
please.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's airplanes with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're UFOs.
[SPEAKER_11]: They came back on August 21st.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there's more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now what happens is he thinks it cut
between the two on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_10]: therefore making the assumption that I was
wrong, that this is not one object.
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't know how far the two objects
were away from each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: This very event we have on videotape,
VHS, that is on a 90-degree angle
[SPEAKER_10]: confirming my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now what's interesting, when he gets close
to some of these, he can see some of the
[SPEAKER_10]: colors that are really interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he queued right in.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's them, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's them.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same red chariot lights as we had
before.
[SPEAKER_10]: There seems to be a pattern, too,
when you analyze it one-thirtieth of a
[SPEAKER_10]: second to see the patterns.
[SPEAKER_10]: They also go on and off.
[SPEAKER_10]: The two will illuminate.
[SPEAKER_10]: They fade, and one will get brighter,
and there seems to be a pattern.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, when you look very close at the
craft itself, there's arcing blue,
[SPEAKER_10]: like electrical blue arcing underneath it,
and I have still photographs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you like that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're going to show you some footage
from Phoenix that I think is also truly
[SPEAKER_10]: remarkable, again from Arizona research.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our gentleman out there who has done some
magnificent footage.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he has up to 60 hours of footage
now of some things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now this is what we are able to show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully sometime in the future we'll be
able to show more.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Rob's last one, I believe,
and if we could see that, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_10]: tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: This happened on 9-11 of all days,
2005.
[SPEAKER_10]: The funny thing about that is you know
that in Phoenix, like when we had the
[SPEAKER_10]: Phoenix lights, all of a sudden they're
saying two hours afterwards, and they drop
[SPEAKER_10]: the flares.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying that prior event was
actually the event.
[SPEAKER_10]: The funny thing about this, they dropped
flares in the same area where this very
[SPEAKER_10]: huge and unusual array of lights,
let's say, and possible object was
[SPEAKER_10]: actually located at.
[SPEAKER_10]: The funny thing about it, they did that a
couple days afterwards, and yet the news
[SPEAKER_10]: agencies picked it up as that being the
event.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now mind you, we had two hours before and
the Phoenix light, this was actually days
[SPEAKER_10]: later, and yet they said this was the
event.
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_10]: They do time travel in the media.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see if we could have that last
piece, that last, there we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now please watch this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you see those three, these three here,
pay no attention to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's actually a result or a unusual
artifact that shows up on his camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to know he went through nine
cameras doing this research.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to be a field investigator
around these types of anomalous events and
[SPEAKER_10]: phenomena, you better be able to replace
your equipment because they beat the heck
[SPEAKER_10]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please pay attention down here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see this line?
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you can, speed it up please.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pay attention to this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're looking towards south,
towards South Mountain, about 20 plus
[SPEAKER_10]: miles away.
[SPEAKER_10]: In this direction, would be Sky Harbor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody here know the Arizona area?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so you have an idea where we're at.
[SPEAKER_10]: North by Glendale, up that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now see what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_10]: You will see things shoot out and up along
this object here, this illumination,
[SPEAKER_10]: this illuminated field.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I made the assumption to him,
or I brought the assumption to him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's make the assumption this was one
huge object.
[SPEAKER_10]: I says, would you be able to give me an
estimation on its size, knowing where it
[SPEAKER_10]: would be located?
[SPEAKER_10]: And the estimation came back to eight
miles long.
[SPEAKER_10]: I find this to be, well, back that up
please.
[SPEAKER_10]: Back that up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't show this other footage.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that rather impressive or not?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you will see a plane.
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's back that up and run that slow
because a plane is coming, an airplane is
[SPEAKER_10]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little bit, back it up,
and you'll see an airplane to the right
[SPEAKER_10]: come in through here, going to Sky Harbor.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all I could say is, can you imagine
being the pilot saying this?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd take a week's vacation at a minimum.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll come across here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this was a 9-11-2005.
[SPEAKER_10]: The funny thing is, 9-11-2005,
we also had events in Tinley Park.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Tinley Park sighting, there was
correlations with multiple events around
[SPEAKER_10]: the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first sighting day, we actually had
sightings around the world as far as even
[SPEAKER_10]: the GNC.
[SPEAKER_10]: The very next morning, we had sightings
down in Houston, Texas.
[SPEAKER_10]: On Channel 11, they actually showed some
footage, supposedly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was never able to get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The 24th and the 23rd, depending on what
time zone you live in, in Australia,
[SPEAKER_10]: there was the very same craft,
as seen in Tinley Park, the same
[SPEAKER_10]: illuminated field and isosceles layout of
illuminations actually photographed in
[SPEAKER_10]: Melbourne, Australia.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you very much with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that, pretty good?
[SPEAKER_10]: Time is getting close, and I'd like to
cover a few things.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to cover at this point,
if you don't mind, communication.
[SPEAKER_10]: Communication, you know, regardless of how
much technology and whatever we have
[SPEAKER_10]: today, we could, you know, we got cell
phones.
[SPEAKER_10]: Heck, you could call somebody anywhere
around the world, again, up in New Guinea,
[SPEAKER_10]: and you could be out in the forest or
whatever, and you have a cell phone or a
[SPEAKER_10]: satellite phone, and you could still
communicate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cell phone, probably not, but satellite
phone, yes, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Communication is a funny thing,
though how we communicate is even funnier
[SPEAKER_10]: yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, for the past 60 years, and we're
celebrating 60 years of Roswell,
[SPEAKER_10]: correct?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also celebrating 60 years of modern
year.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're celebrating 60 years of modern
euphology.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've communicated to the scientific
community through this period of time and
[SPEAKER_10]: basically presenting them with what we
feel to be rather substantial bits of
[SPEAKER_10]: information, quality evidence to some
degree, and if you're to talk to Ted
[SPEAKER_10]: Phillips, very hard evidence.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, the community at large,
at least the scientific community at
[SPEAKER_10]: large, hasn't been, let's say,
dented as of yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Though I think the general public is
finally getting the idea that there's
[SPEAKER_10]: something more to this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you can look at all different types
of polls, and they vary between certain
[SPEAKER_10]: amounts, and if you talk to a skeptic,
it's 40% that think that something's here,
[SPEAKER_10]: they like to use the term believe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like the term belief thrown in the
garbage.
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe is actually a leap of faith.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to take something on faith without
evidence.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody here walking through those
corridors, looking at the material and
[SPEAKER_10]: talking or listening to any of the
speakers and seeing the data and footage
[SPEAKER_10]: or any witnesses, if you could walk away
and say that I can believe because,
[SPEAKER_10]: again, it's a leap of faith, then I'd say
you're not listening very well or reading
[SPEAKER_10]: very well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You should know by now that something
truly unusual is going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're being visited, I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: By what?
[SPEAKER_10]: From where?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no conclusion, but I think we
should leave all those options open at the
[SPEAKER_10]: very least.
[SPEAKER_10]: We shouldn't make any quick decisions,
but in the same token, we should allow
[SPEAKER_10]: ourselves to at least consider the
possibilities, and this is something we
[SPEAKER_10]: should really prod science with because
it's to the point now that we really have
[SPEAKER_10]: to go beyond that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for the next 60 years, I like something
else would be, something else may take
[SPEAKER_10]: place, at least we hope something else
would take place.
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing to do is to bypass science
altogether.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just talk to one another.
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it funny?
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't talk to one another anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not at the meetings, and we're not
congregating at things like this that
[SPEAKER_10]: much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing is to make use of other
ways and means to communicate.
[SPEAKER_10]: One way is the abstract form, and
intelligence is, true intelligence is the
[SPEAKER_10]: use of abstract abilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: Use of the abstract.
[SPEAKER_10]: Art and science have more similarities
than one can imagine, and with that in
[SPEAKER_10]: mind, I'd like to show you a very nice
music video by Sufjan Stevens,
[SPEAKER_10]: is the musician, the artwork by Jim Davis,
who is the art director on the East Coast
[SPEAKER_10]: at one of the universities.
[SPEAKER_10]: When the first time I saw this,
it actually brought me to tears.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has nothing to do with the actual event
of a sighting in Illinois on January 5th,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it made a good title, and it strummed
the chord of imagination for this
[SPEAKER_10]: gentleman, these two artists.
[SPEAKER_10]: On that note, I'd like to please show this
video.
[SPEAKER_10]: I say please again.
[SPEAKER_10]: The DVD.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
