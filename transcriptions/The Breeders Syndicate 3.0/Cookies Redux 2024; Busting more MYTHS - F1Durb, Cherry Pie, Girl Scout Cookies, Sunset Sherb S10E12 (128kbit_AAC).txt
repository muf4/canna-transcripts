[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matt, here with my co-host
Thousandfold, and our constant stay guest,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Farmer F***ing Dan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can see his face too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I'm not supposed to cuss in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to cuss in the first 30
seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, here with my co-host
Thousandfold, and our friend Farmer Dan,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's been a mainstay on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to be talking,
kind of revisiting our cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding with cookies, and the dead ends
of cookies, and whether it is a breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: dead end or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided, and actually we kind of,
as a group, decided to revisit this a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was re-watching the episode that we did,
and I think it was super informative at
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning, but there's a few
narratives that got spun in it that just
[SPEAKER_02]: don't ring true, and I tried to kind of
put that out there during the episode
[SPEAKER_02]: while we were recording it, but it doesn't
seem like it was heard very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, like, I'm seeing stuff pop up on
social media that XYZ is responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies and this and that, and it's just
not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of all things that we want to do with
this show is combat misinformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, first and foremost, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the opposite of our mission to make
it about an ego thing, like, I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for this, this, and this,
and no one else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, all that is the opposite
of what we want to do, and it is our
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a hard decision, but we're
gonna go ahead and redo it, reshoot it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and try to keep it as accurate as we can
for the time being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if things change, we'll do
another one, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as all of us are kind of sick of
talking about cookies and all of its
[SPEAKER_02]: derivatives, it's a necessary thing,
and it just seems like people only heard
[SPEAKER_02]: the last, I don't know, two minutes of the
episode this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, Thousand, you want to kick
it off and tell them where we're taking
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think where we start,
is looking at the major components,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least that we are aware of,
of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think out of F1 Derb, Cherry Pie,
GDP, Purple Urkel, and OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we start with the F1 Derb.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the F1 Derb is a very unique
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not passed around a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of debate, be it from Kenny
Flowers or Powers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says that he's never passed the cut,
but we know he doesn't really grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has other people make seeds for them,
so of course he has to pass the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a guy named Cookie Monster
who kept the F1 Derb for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was responsible for the F1 Derb
account on Instagram, and that's the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: cut that we have in the circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a unique cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It obviously has a lot of the structure
that you see in cookies, the really unique
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bubbly bracts, very specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: The knobby look that cookies has comes
from a lot of the F1 Derb stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's debatable on whether it's an S1 or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's one of those things where we
just won't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is another cut called, we call the
Derbin Bay, or the Bay Derbin,
[SPEAKER_02]: that CSI got from Green Dragon,
I think five, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was growing them side by side
because we've been doing our F1 Derb
[SPEAKER_02]: projects together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was growing them side by side and
thought somebody screwed up the cut
[SPEAKER_02]: because in veg, they were so identical
that he was sure someone screwed up,
[SPEAKER_02]: like one of his workers screwed up the
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was all pissed off, and then they
start flowering, and they're almost
[SPEAKER_02]: identical looking, except one is green and
one is a deep black purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's differences in the turf profiles,
but we'll see over time how acclimatizing
[SPEAKER_02]: and being in the same room over time,
being fed the same stuff over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how much those turf profiles
either get similar or if they break
[SPEAKER_02]: further apart or they stay where they're
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as of right now, it seems like one is
a descendant of the other, one is a sister
[SPEAKER_02]: of the other, bag seed of the other,
hybrid of the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really, really unique cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as much as I've always taken what
Cookie Fam says with a grain of salt,
[SPEAKER_02]: because none of them are breeders,
barely any of them are growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does seem to hold true that F1 Derb is
a major component of Forum cookies proper
[SPEAKER_02]: and probably Thin Mint as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, if you have any takes on F1 Derb at
all?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never even had a chance to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never come across the clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got more thoughts on the next few.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one other thing I'll add is this is one
of the main reasons I'm really doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two is that, you know, there were some
rumors going around that the anus cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can call what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught the anus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the mother or is F1 Derb?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's no relation when that claim
was made.
[SPEAKER_02]: The person who made that claim had never
smoked, grown, seen F1 Derb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of a bold claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: But going off what me and CSI have seen,
there's no way it's just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The anus does look like a Mendo perps
type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether F1 Derb is a Mendo perps type or
not, unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very different looking than F1 Derb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, than Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to leave it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe how fast that spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm a part of something that's
misinformation, I got to cut it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with that one, I don't feel like it
was ever explicitly said to, because I
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of filled that gap in myself as well
and thought that for a few months there
[SPEAKER_04]: where I was just like, oh, I don't think
he wants to say it out of like humility or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I completely fell into that trap,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fairness, like I got to watch from
behind the scenes how that narrative
[SPEAKER_02]: started evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started with like, hey,
I think someone else saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this Mendo perps is in cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just kind of slowly evolved
into connecting this dot and string and
[SPEAKER_02]: dot and string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but without actually any additional
data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, zero data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more grows, no more flowers,
no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else that anus cuts not around to
be even compared now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a whole lot of stuff that was
missing from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that data point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd rather I'd rather stick to what we
know and what we've seen and what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've actually grown F1 Derb,
sourced it very early on, used it,
[SPEAKER_02]: bred with it, ran the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: From it, the progeny chased it back down
by a frostboss and stony rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it takes it takes growing
stuff, smoking it, learning about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their progeny, their supposed progeny to
really try to make educated conclusions on
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that, just saying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And isn't enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably where I'll leave the
F1 Derb conversation after now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to ask you one more thing,
Matt, which is what was your anecdotal
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not asking you to obviously make
any claims, but maybe like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your speculations on it based on
what you saw of its traits or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, anything interesting that you
noticed?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I grew it, it was very like the
word for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had a champagne Merlot type smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some pissiness, but I never caught
the gingerbread end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there is some sort of
gingerbread end to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other people smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hermprone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's like the first thing you
notice when running it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very hermprone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's looser than it looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like visually, you look at it,
you might think it's more dense like
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies, but it's not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a Durban poison is probably one of
the questions I get the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say there's no way in hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pure Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a lot of Afghani type traits to
it, which Durban poison is a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot of different things
called Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an area in Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things that come out of
that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditionally, there's the Dutch passion
Durban poison that most people think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the NorCal Durban poison,
which is ultrapeneline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was the Mel Frank Durban
poison cut that was all anus, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like aniseed.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't necessarily that.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Kenny Powers, he said a few times,
few different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that F1 DERB is the DERB crossed
to F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is an F1?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it's like a Formula One race car.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we call it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he also later said it is Durban
crossed to Durban crossed to something
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed to purple pain, which was like a
purple from the Bay Area, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably like an Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hard to say, hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't see a lot of Urkel in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's that's probably the most
I could say about the traits, other than
[SPEAKER_02]: what we talked about later on in its
relation to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, people are now starting to
grow out some of those crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might might learn more of it over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we can move on to cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to kick it off, Dan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I started seeing it in like 2014,
15, I think the clone was at HPRC in
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcata.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's where I picked it up,
at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of wasn't a good grower yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I got like little popcorn buds of
just like rock hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like green with marbling,
like stripes of purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: How hard was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really nice, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that a pound of it was like the
size of a football.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was the smallest pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've still seen the date.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was really killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The smoke was kind of meh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was tasty, but didn't get you that
high compared to like the diesel headband
[SPEAKER_04]: OG that kind of everyone crapped out at
that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just another one like that people
kept a few plants of and like their
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor patch just as like variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like it wasn't like a bulk produced
plant that I I don't think I've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone ever bulk produce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first experience with the cherry pie
was on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lump status had just gotten a hold of the
cut and was growing that and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other cookie fam cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember looking at the cherry pie
on there just thinking this is so
[SPEAKER_02]: gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the forum was he was also
growing the forum publicly on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very unique looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cherry pie really, really like is it
cherry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like a cherry pie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that all was very intriguing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at it, it was just it looked
like more of what I wanted to grow versus
[SPEAKER_02]: the forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember reaching out to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't friends yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I reached out to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, hey, dude, what do you want
for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to trade for that cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ended up doing some sort of
exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given him right area or something
like that, like my mom cut of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a mutual friend of ours who I'll shout
out, Gail from PNC ape, radical dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, back in the day in San Diego,
he ran a place called People's Nursery
[SPEAKER_02]: Care, PNC, and he had some of the most
legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's where I saw strawberry cream
originally from that clone, the sole
[SPEAKER_02]: assassin number three and one source from
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: L.A.
Afi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just all kinds of stuff, dude,
like he was so responsible for so much
[SPEAKER_02]: ending up in my hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Gail Gail's legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like there were so few clones that I
ever got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I don't know about that
one from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so much before his time doing great
provenance of research serious about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a good business down there,
really good business.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still up and running somewhere,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what he's necessarily doing
now, but he's still out there kicking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came and brought down cherry pie
along with some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was about 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my first time running it, the first
thing I noticed was, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a lot of gas to cherry pie,
not just the sweet end, but there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: gassy end that you could pull out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reminded me a lot of like an OG gassy type
when you pull gassy OG out.
What else was there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful purple colors that you can pull
out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Structure's very, I'll bring this up right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a structure so reminiscent of the
F1 derb that it's almost hard to ignore
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're absolutely related.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would venture to guess Urkel GDP type
with the F1 derb makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is some kind of gassy OG Kush to
it and there's some speculation with me on
[SPEAKER_02]: F1 derb maybe having OG cross to it at
some point or inside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think that's most of the
cherry pie tale, unless you guys have any
[SPEAKER_02]: questions to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, anything else you wanted to add,
Dan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remember it had little triangle buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was all popcorn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very similar to Forum in that
regard, where it was all small buds that
[SPEAKER_04]: were very, very dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could tell looking at them even as
clones when they were growing that they
[SPEAKER_02]: were probably directly related in some way
as well, the Forum and the cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also vaguely remember it growing pretty
slow and shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was growing slow and
shitty at the time because it was so young
[SPEAKER_02]: at that time it hadn't been passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember really.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I think about it, I vaguely
remember just like kind of a shorter slow
[SPEAKER_04]: growing plant, which would kind of lend
itself to something like an Urkel or a
[SPEAKER_04]: GDP.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let me add in intersects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it is related to the F1 derb,
then that's probably why.
[SPEAKER_02]: That trait seems to be pretty heavy in
cookies and cherry pie and a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to foreshadow at this point
that we're probably not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: around to constructing any kind of
timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this is kind of that these
genetics are like a crazy circle,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know, you know, inbred nested ring
of whatever cannabis human centipede vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we can move on to GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another one that has I don't
even know if I want to go into the history
[SPEAKER_02]: of GDP so much as kind of reference it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know CSI is like his opinion on GDP has
changed a lot of what is GDP, what is
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel, which I don't even know if he's
brought up publicly, but it's interesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: real interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll leave that to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when he owes us an episode and I
reminded him just this weekend,
[SPEAKER_02]: you owe us an episode, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently Kush are the giants in the
little hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm both going to try and add some
pressure as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it'll help or not,
but he knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a wonderful video with Ken
Estes talking about the history of GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember a long time ago on the
forums, I transcribed it so people could
[SPEAKER_02]: actually read what Mumblemouth was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially, he said that he was given
the clone by Native American shamans in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of some headlights at a ceremony of
sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because he was such a cool white man,
they decided to gift him this magical
[SPEAKER_02]: clone that was not only skunk,
but like from Vietnam and all this other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the most purple we'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, GDP reminds me a lot of an
Urkel type, and they seem to be directly
[SPEAKER_02]: related in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if one came before the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, almost everything was
called GDP, whether it was Urkel,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it was Great Vape, whether all
those names were so interchangeable,
[SPEAKER_02]: it became really hard to tie it down to a
specific clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the Ken's GDP referring to Ken
Estes that was super purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he made a seed line that he
called Granddaddy Purple, which really
[SPEAKER_02]: screwed everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, everybody had the
real GDP, Ken's GDP, because he put out
[SPEAKER_02]: the seed line of fence seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as relation is, I don't see much
difference between it and Urkel and how it
[SPEAKER_02]: breeds to really say, again, which came
first, the chicken or the egg,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the both so heavily involved in thin
mint and in borum, in my opinion that they
[SPEAKER_02]: could be synonymous and used
interchangeably in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grapey, purple, slow growing, super
Afghani outdoors, they have more narrow
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves than they would broadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people would confuse it for a
sativa outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, a short squat, short internode
spacing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, super grapey.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in veg, both the GDP and Urkel are
some of the absolute skunkiest cuts you
[SPEAKER_02]: can have.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take cuts of those things,
it fills up a room and smells like just
[SPEAKER_02]: straight skunk spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when flowering about week six,
they go from that skunky smell to sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a big change up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's what I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you have much experience
with the dance.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, so I've never actually held like a
verified cut of any of the real purples.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were a little bit before my time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember buying bags of stuff called
GDP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's really good purple weed in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing that I've always thought was
interesting was I saw this peer reviewed
[SPEAKER_04]: paper where they had collected a bunch of
clones out of American grows and done the
[SPEAKER_04]: gene correlations and made a phylogenetic
tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of the purples were clustered
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of them were also very much
more basal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like you have the tree going off of
like all the modern cuts and you see like
[SPEAKER_04]: OG and you see C 99 and all the shit just
on this main branch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then out of nowhere from way more
basal, the purple shoot up to the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, that kind of lends itself to
the stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few stories that we've heard on
the show of people being given seeds from
[SPEAKER_04]: the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've heard a few of those stories
myself outside the show as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's kind of where most of
them arrived from is from like Afghanis
[SPEAKER_04]: and like, you know, cuts from the,
from the East over there and them getting
[SPEAKER_04]: stored and then popped by people in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where most of these
cuts come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually showed that grape ape was
the most basal out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean like the, the parental?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like further upstream, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say basal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it, it would be like grape ape and
then like a branch off of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would show GDP and a branch off of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would show Urkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I can't remember the placement
of each of them in regards to each other,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it also depends on like what the named
cut that those people collected were,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I've never been able to tell the
difference when someone says, Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is purple Kush clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a GDP.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they all are really, really similar
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think that they're all
probably very closely related,
[SPEAKER_04]: if not renames of cuts or backseeds of
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The SR 71 purple Kush was a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had that growing side by side with
Urkel back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was sourced from blue sky cafe or
SR 71, which became blue sky cafe later
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could never tell the difference
between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we'd say, Oh, the SR 71.
[SPEAKER_02]: The SR 71 is more hashy or earthy hashy,
but like it could have just been
[SPEAKER_02]: different, you know, just small little
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they were all so similar,
all of them GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all grew short squat, short inter
node spacing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had less trouble with grape ape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought it was kind of prettier
and had more narrow type leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've seen Urkel that way too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I think you're right too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just an introduction of old
purple Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's one of those things where
it was so many clones were passed around
[SPEAKER_02]: in the same area of California with these
different names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously Urkel didn't pop up as a name
until family matters was a TV show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before that it had other names,
you know, like just purple, purple bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: purple skunk, you know, things like that
were around GDP was named what it was
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was supposed to be the OG
purple, the one that came before all the
[SPEAKER_02]: other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The granddaddy of them, you know,
but whether that's true or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just like someone trying to push a
narrative again, like trying to find that
[SPEAKER_02]: original called it would be damn near
impossible to untie that unless you find
[SPEAKER_02]: someone that's had it good provenance
going back, however long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna, I was gonna prompt this next
one, which is, uh, we're gonna obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about OG as well, but we've also
seen, uh, we've also seen Urkel hybrids of
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, uh, Urkel OG hybrids out there,
uh, made by other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like obviously Caleb's got T 1000 and I
can't remember the line that that was
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think based on looking at
just straight OG Urkel type hybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they might resemble cookies or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get really, really close.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get damn close to cookies with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's not the most common expression,
but you can get really damn close without,
[SPEAKER_02]: without the, it, without the F1 Derb
essentially, but you've got a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different of a structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always get a more OG type structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I do still think that it's part of the
reason why I think OG is an F1 Derb
[SPEAKER_02]: though, because it's only a little bit of
a hint of a difference between an Urkel OG
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid and what we knew as forum per se,
you know, um, the, the thin mint to me was
[SPEAKER_02]: always more narrow leaf, which I was kind
of wondering where that came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: As opposed to this Urkel OG hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may just be that difference between
what's dominating in there and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: F1 Derb.
[SPEAKER_02]: But F1 Derb also looks pretty broad leafed
in many ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, Caleb did a lot of, uh,
Urkel and OG hybrids before he made it up
[SPEAKER_02]: to T 1000.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had the Savage Urkel, which is the SFV,
uh, SFV Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was God's gift back in the day,
which was GDP OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was real famous in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used that early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think I even did some, but a lot of
people were doing that combination,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, OG was hype and Urkels were hype
and that's what people wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Soul Assassin number three looked
like an Urkel OG, looked just dead on like
[SPEAKER_02]: an Urkel OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't have the same knobby structure or
bubbly calyxes that, um, or bracts that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, uh, cookies has, but the resin
production was absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of gassy skunkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was short, low yielding,
like popcorn structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a lot of the, it ticked a lot of
the same boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really high THC testing,
really dull high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts on that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've seen some OG hybrids with
different purples and the only thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: makes me go back to Mendopurps is the,
the Anis and the Licorice turps because
[SPEAKER_04]: those turps are they're so prevalent when
you breed with cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, it's, I think one of the main
components that makes that sherb aroma as
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like referenced, you know,
and I don't really get a lot of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I've bred with this stuff,
I don't really get skunkier, grapey ever,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's pretty much always like
some creamy licorice type thing with some
[SPEAKER_04]: gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, that's the only reason I think it
in some way in the most incestuous way
[SPEAKER_04]: possible leads back to Mendopurp as the,
the donor for the purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, also, I mean, it's hard to say
though, because Mendopurps also it's
[SPEAKER_04]: purple traits are true purple,
you know, versus the other ones they're
[SPEAKER_04]: very, um, uh, climate dependent,
you know, like the temperature dependent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, that's like the counter
argument is that it's like, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, there's not a lot of true breeding
purple in cookies lines either,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's always kind of that gray
purple and it comes on late, whereas like
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendopurps and some of its hybrids will
like purple out in a hot room at week two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, it goes back and forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see data data points that point in both
directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and Mendopurps, another thing
about that is that it has a lot of magenta
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true breeding as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's hard to shake magenta out of
Mendopurps hybrids down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just never see that in the cookies
on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought, but it doesn't mean that
you can't directionally breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it could always be a directional
breeding and managed to avoid that magenta
[SPEAKER_02]: trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's like with, uh,
the other place I see it is in Chitral and
[SPEAKER_02]: like double purple Doja, stuff like that
from the Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's always been some kind of,
um, theories on whether, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackberry was related to Mendopurps or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, Mendopurps may be one of those old
purple Afghanis that was floating around
[SPEAKER_02]: and God knows where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know if I necessarily
believe every story I hear now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think it was a base for a lot of
the purples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how it got to be that base,
whether it was a sister, whether it was
[SPEAKER_02]: one cut, whether it was bag seeds going
around, um, NorCal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't even necessarily the first
thing called Mendocino purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was other Mendocino purples earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to do an episode on that
too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were going to do a purple pink
magenta maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm all making fun of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were going to do that instead of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this needed to be done for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've sort of talked about OG already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else to add,
um, on the OG side of things?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as this goes, like with cookies,
like, um, a really good example of an OG
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant cookies would have been something
like, uh, animal cookies to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was the, the more OG end of,
of for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they almost, again, they almost
looked identical in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they almost looked identical in flour,
except it had more of an OG Kush structure
[SPEAKER_02]: and more of an OG Kush scent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was probably one of my favorite
cuts on all of them because I really liked
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think you get cookies without
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can get OG KB, OG Kush breath
looking stuff without OG, but I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think you can get the gassiness and OG KB
and the potency with just purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or with just like an herbal type,
you can get the mutation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't necessarily get the gassy and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at it and I see the structure and
like the leaf to bud ratio where it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: basically just like two little leaves that
are at the base of the bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's all flower above that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is like the modern structure that I
see.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think all of that comes from OG from
my own breedings with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's the number one thing that
gets passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you missed.
[SPEAKER_04]: By a mile on the Terps, um, you still end
up with that structure and that look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a major component of what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think you have it without the
OG essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, coming up, we have, we have
another cut or at least another name that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've covered quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sherb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you run with this one,
Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's like, yeah, which Sherb
are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you can go into that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only talk about Sunset when I talk about
Sherb because in my opinion, it's the main
[SPEAKER_04]: one that matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the whole green Sherb thing and
Skittles and all that is it's fun to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about, but like Sunset Sherb to me was
like the first one that was like a really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really good cash crop plant that came out
of all these lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you could get great weight,
great potency, a variety of aromas from
[SPEAKER_04]: creamy to like pure fuel on the same cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, I have pictures from some
grows that I did of it and I think 2017,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, that are just like whole rooms just
filled with donkey dick buds, just swaying
[SPEAKER_04]: in the fans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I'd love that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I still had it, but, um,
as far as like what it, what it's made of,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I don't really believe the story of
OG Kush pink panties.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've seen that picture of pink
panties now that we've passed around to
[SPEAKER_04]: each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I maybe I could see it,
but it's, uh, it's so purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a turd, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's airy again, hermprone,
turps, like no resin production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole, this can kind of go into
the last one too of the pink panties,
[SPEAKER_04]: like Buku conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I don't see how you could like
cross a Burmese to an OG and have that
[SPEAKER_04]: plant in one hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't think it's possible because a
Burmese would be like a 20 week flowering,
[SPEAKER_04]: like equatorial Southeast Asian sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe something went around called
Burmese at that point and they crossed it
[SPEAKER_04]: to an OG, but I don't, it looks way more
like it's some sort of like an F1 derb
[SPEAKER_04]: derivative to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Burmese that reefer man passed
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was predominantly like Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it obviously was not a, you know,
high Burmese land race at any stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close enough though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I could definitely see that be in
Buku.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was also very hermprone,
but there was a line from Vancouver called
[SPEAKER_02]: the black Burmese that was definitely
super purple, definitely super hermprone
[SPEAKER_02]: and using reefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure it's reefer man's Burmese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he got it from the dude at
VISC or they traded it or one came from
[SPEAKER_02]: the other, but I'm betting it's a same
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And God, it was trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only thing I can see with
pink panties was sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, my biggest problem with it is there's
a scent in Sherb that goes through every
[SPEAKER_02]: single thing that has Sherb in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can always smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's a lot of it's pretty
smelling, but it's like a peppery note
[SPEAKER_02]: that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really hear people mention it,
but it's just like a, it's so hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: explain, but it's a note.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, but it's so prevalent in
everything that Sherb has touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I just, I couldn't, I just never
liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those ones I can't like,
like a RS 11 has it like it's a big
[SPEAKER_02]: component RS 11, the scent that I'm
talking about, but some people love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just one of those personal
subjective things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, um, sunset Sherb is also responsible
for what I would say is like the majority
[SPEAKER_04]: of like the modern hype cuts at the
moment, like jealousy and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all from like Sherb biscotti in
crosses of one type.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's by far the best
breeding out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you want pretty consistent plants
that throw big buds that are purple,
[SPEAKER_04]: have these modern turf profiles,
like it's probably the one you actually
[SPEAKER_04]: want to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think using the gelatos,
I haven't seen it really go anywhere
[SPEAKER_04]: besides making more gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas like, and same thing with Sherb,
but Sherb is just better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe it's just like that one step
removed farther back.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes it breed slightly better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but, um, I have not been a
fan of breeding with gelato for really
[SPEAKER_04]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we were going to go into that,
you know, I don't know if it's theatrical
[SPEAKER_00]: that next generation, but gelato wedding
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you guys have a taxonomy better than
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wedding cake to me is it, you know,
like a lot of people lump that in with
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies, but to me it's more of a triangle
type of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find that turf profile that and to
me, I just call it cardboard turf profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people think it's like creamy,
you know, as a creamy component,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just think it's garb garb profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, um, you know, everybody was on me
because I may say all this shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like, I really don't like it's to me,
it's the, the one direction I would not
[SPEAKER_02]: want to take triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the midsy, uh, commercial version of
triangle to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone locked it in and called it
wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I can't remember Jay sleazy something
like his name is one of those names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really so into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time trying to like map
this stuff with the last job that I had
[SPEAKER_04]: because like, I really wanted to see like
what directions you could go down by like
[SPEAKER_04]: mixing and matching some of these cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the, um, there is like a very big
gap between like where everyone went with
[SPEAKER_04]: gelato and the Sherb cuts, um,
which I would consider more similar versus
[SPEAKER_04]: like the animal mints hybrids that JB Z
made that's honestly kind of like its own
[SPEAKER_04]: side shoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, it's just as incestuous,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like look up like ice cream cake to
wedding cake to animal mints.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's all the same cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically just reworked a thousand
different ways, but, um, they are separate
[SPEAKER_04]: lines in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that wedding cake and gelato are
two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, yeah, if you want to force to
like, oh, sorry, I was going to ask Dan,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, he mentioned that like he
could see these like broad distinctions
[SPEAKER_00]: across these broad groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you could, if you had to put words
to those distinctions, what would they be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well like wedding cake, like Matt was
shitting on cause like it was a seed line
[SPEAKER_04]: originally that was released.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's, I've barely ever come
across the same cut of wedding cake twice,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, same thing with gelato 33,
you know, it's just like, I think it was
[SPEAKER_04]: originally a seed line that was released
or like maybe he did like a gelato 33 BX
[SPEAKER_04]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: My power's fluttering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so, uh, it,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, what am I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: It, uh, there's just so many of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had really nice cuts of wedding cake
that I liked that I bred with and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, but it's just one of those things
that, um, wedding cake is creamy,
[SPEAKER_04]: huge buds, some purple, not always,
um, potency is meh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, they're honestly just like
flavors of the same thing or the same
[SPEAKER_04]: family, but that they were taken in
separate directions and then ran with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like wedding cake doesn't have in those
lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really have a lot of overcross
back into gelato until you get to ice
[SPEAKER_04]: cream cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's like wedding cake times
gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and actually I loved ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was a good cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as a good cash cropper or made me some
money over a few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, it's not something that I miss
now that I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never run in or smoked it ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of look at the three main
categories as like the Sherb gelatos,
[SPEAKER_04]: the green Sherb skittles, and then the
animal mints, wedding cake stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are like the three main groupings in
my mind that you can actually like map out
[SPEAKER_04]: as separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, like wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I look at wedding cake is the dead
end of triangle, whereas gelato would be
[SPEAKER_02]: the dead end of Burkle triangle to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like once you hit that point,
like you can make a whole bunch more
[SPEAKER_02]: wedding cake type stuff and name it
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always going to be very similar to
wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what 99% of the market
is, is either the dead end of gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you've got to that, it's almost
like, uh, having a, a trip in a laney
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get there, you can't really wipe
it out that well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could try, but it's always going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was trying to do it with blue
bonnet and wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just, to me, it just made like a
creamy commercial blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Novel, unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it, when you start inbreeding,
you start back-crossing in not knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of where you're going to end
up in my opinion, or, or, or bad seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: a bag seeds, a bag seeds, a bag seeds in
the same direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like gelato.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're essentially in like a genetic
cul-de-sac at that point, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way to put all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I always say it's like a,
a shit breeding dead end, but a genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: cul-de-sac is probably a nicer way of
putting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really the question I'm just
paraphrasing here is like, why,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there is no real value to taking
those things any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like within those constraints,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and what you end up seeing,
what you end up seeing nowadays is that
[SPEAKER_04]: people take things from outside these
lines or from like more basal regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they try and reflavor it while
keeping the look, the structure,
[SPEAKER_04]: the trim ability, like all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're like, well, now we've got
cherry trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got blueberry gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've got Z flavor gel, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: With runs kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all still the same shit,
whether you throw a little, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you're saying like a blue bonnet,
like, oh yeah, blueberry gelato now,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, but it's still midsy and it's
still like has all the problems and you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't take it further really, because like
you start ending up with all these
[SPEAKER_04]: negative traits, like the little aborted
seed pods that are in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everywhere in these lines,
like you can't get away from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, if you hybridize like a bunch
of gelato and skills together,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, or a permanent marker, skittles,
whatever these crosses you want to make
[SPEAKER_04]: together, you end up losing like 50% of it
to a lot of these negative traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's good smoke, it's usually the
best cut too, where you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, this smells good.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has actually got some potency to it
and you grind it up and there's like a
[SPEAKER_04]: million little aborted seeds in your,
you know, little pile of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just depends on if that's like a
deal breaker for you, I guess,
[SPEAKER_04]: or not, but it's not something I want to
see.
Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish that people would do more
novel stuff than like gelato runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gelato, oh gee, gelato, gelato,
you know, like, and to me just that's 99%
[SPEAKER_02]: of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people have been told that
they want is buds that look just like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what, I mean, to me,
that's what compound was, gelato,
[SPEAKER_02]: gelato, gelato, and just ran with it and
it's still being run with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I really, really dislike it
just from a breeding perspective is
[SPEAKER_02]: because so much was dropped in place that
was novel, unique, old, because the market
[SPEAKER_02]: was demanding so much of that crap that
like I've been talking about, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders are asking me, hey, do you know
where I can get a good OG cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's not a lot of OG cuts out
there anymore because people wanted gelato
[SPEAKER_02]: and demanded it so much that OG just
wasn't in demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bags wouldn't sell of OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And realistically, it costs money to keep
moms of something that you cannot make
[SPEAKER_02]: money with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's either done out of like a sense of
duty, a love for collecting, or monetary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have all three in some
cases, it's just not gonna fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hype at its finest, marketing at
its finest, and easiest and sheepish to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are gonna get so mad that I say
that, but it's all I see with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another phrase comes to mind for me,
which is that these, again, paraphrasing
[SPEAKER_00]: both of you, like these names are just
like all like false alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can see that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the illusion that you're choosing
between varying things, but actually
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not really choosing at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, realistically, with all the
cookie stuff, like from day one,
[SPEAKER_02]: like none of this, Girl Scout Cookies
doesn't smell like thin mint cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't taste like thin mint cookies,
chocolate, like Andy's mints.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just carried on, whether you're
talking about sherbet tasting like orange
[SPEAKER_02]: sherbet.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like wedding cake, to me, creamy,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it sweet, creamy, battery?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's marketing, and it's just so
dishonest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know why, like, specifically,
I remember when Animal Cookies came out,
[SPEAKER_02]: and before I had it, there were a couple
of gentlemen, I don't remember who they
[SPEAKER_02]: were, talking about it and reviewing the
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're sitting there smelling like,
oh my God, this smells so much like animal
[SPEAKER_02]: crackers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, God damn, that would be
fucking awesome, animal cracker bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that would be the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the smell of animal crackers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it got really built up until I
grabbed it, and I was like, this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: animal crackers, this is OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, a lot of false promises
get sold, but at some point, that
[SPEAKER_02]: expectation was just wiped, and people
didn't have the expectation for a name to
[SPEAKER_02]: have anything to do with the scent,
taste, or there's something psychosomatic
[SPEAKER_02]: going on where they're convincing
themselves that, yeah, it's totally animal
[SPEAKER_02]: crackers, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can influence people's perception of
aromas by the marketing of its naming and
[SPEAKER_04]: all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you say like, hey,
this smells like cookies, people smell it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and maybe they get some of that battery,
and they're like, oh yeah, it kind of does
[SPEAKER_04]: smell like cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, what fucking cookie is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not chocolate chip, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not peanut butter cookies,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bless my mind, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's like, you can influence
people's perception of aroma very easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I want people's opinions on
what something smells like in a jar,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't tell them anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if I say, like, do you smell the
wine?
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be like, yeah, actually,
I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because your brain is filling it in,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think when you experience a field
of complexity or noise, it's very easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: project things onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like looking at clouds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Daydreaming, looking at clouds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your friend goes, oh, do you see the
battleship?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, yeah, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the human mind is very malleable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our perception of reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have it worse than others,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a certain sense of
skepticism to get past that, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be an inherently skeptical person to
not have your mind made up before you
[SPEAKER_02]: sniff something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, same as Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if my partner has bought us some new
coffee, I don't want to read the bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to say that it has
apricot, strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try it for myself and then see
what they said about it afterwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so I can compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it is too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine those things too easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either you're the kid that sniffs your
friend's finger when he says, smell my
[SPEAKER_02]: finger, or you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, most of the time, without any
information, that's why I love showing my
[SPEAKER_04]: wife weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she's just like, yeah,
it smells good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how I am with most things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm smelling a bag of coffee,
I'm not thinking about all the other
[SPEAKER_04]: things it could possibly smell like or
taste like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh yeah, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you make a cup and you're like,
yeah, it tastes pretty fucking good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, then you read the bag and you
fill in like, oh yeah, notes of caramel.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And suddenly your brain's like,
oh yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tasted that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Starbucks graham cracker coffee really
does taste like graham crackers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, because they probably pureed some
fucking graham crackers in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so good, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to be able to drink coffee again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a long time I couldn't drink
coffee without puking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm there with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have more than one cup, I'm like,
blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can have it for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was it worth us talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys already referenced
Permanent Marker and RS11 and Jealousy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth talking about those at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Dan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've bred with them in the past
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like pretty extensively with the last
place I was working with and Permanent
[SPEAKER_04]: Marker I think is actually some pretty
good smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something I would take to a
desert island with me, but it's like good
[SPEAKER_04]: variety because it takes that like Sherb
Anis profile and it's just like cranked
[SPEAKER_04]: up, you know, and it's not that potent,
but it's just, it's really, really amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think I sent, I sent someone on the
server a couple of bags of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was a skills S1 Permanent
Marker and a few other things I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even he agreed, he was just like the
Permanent Marker is like even compared to
[SPEAKER_04]: the Skittles, it's like a very similar
profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It like has elements of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like turned up to 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I thought it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first like cookies directional
thing that I'd smoked a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, I kind of actually fucking
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it lasted an A.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tolerance part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that quick cookies buildup of a
tolerance to where it just you see it in
[SPEAKER_04]: the lab analysis too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like not a very diverse sample as far
as like any accessory cannabinoids or like
[SPEAKER_04]: small amounts of different terpenes that
you look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's kind of just like, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it breeds, they all breed very
dominantly because they've been so like
[SPEAKER_04]: inadvertently line bred by multiple
different people over the last,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Permanent Marker is very much like
RS 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that like not that they breed the
same, but that they're very consistent in
[SPEAKER_04]: their structures that they pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see like when I crossed Permanent
Marker, everything looked like Permanent
[SPEAKER_04]: Marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just depended on whether the the
other plant had like a more dominant aroma
[SPEAKER_04]: profile or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I was crossing it to some fruit
punch type stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fruit punch just always came
through and it looked exactly like
[SPEAKER_04]: Permanent Marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, this is fucking boring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with RS 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: RS 11 does like like a nice gelato
structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these like thin little finger
buds that are just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a small collection of calyxes just like
stacked on each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was all garbage in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at it and I was just like,
oh, let me take notes on another fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly like the last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're very predictable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I don't think people get
is that these things may be massive poly
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids, but they've poly hybrids with the
same base components.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so things actually do get fairly fixed
over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's usually the bad stuff and pretty
looks, you know, low potency, pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: looks, some, a lot of cardboard turps,
but they're very consistent in what they
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like RS 11, like unless you cross it to
something like a Bully, like a train wreck
[SPEAKER_04]: or a blue dream or something like that,
like I can tell you exactly the breakdown
[SPEAKER_04]: of like the types of expressions you're
likely to see because it is so consistent,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's consistently bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the, the, the really nice clones that
get pulled out of these hybrids are the
[SPEAKER_04]: exception to the rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you buy these seeds and you're
like, oh, it's, you know, soap times this
[SPEAKER_04]: or that, like you're going to find mostly
trash and like you may be the one that
[SPEAKER_04]: gets lucky that finds like a really nice
tasting one or one that has some unusual
[SPEAKER_04]: potency for the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they rarely all line up in one,
you know, like I'll run 50 to a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds of some of that stuff and just be
like, Oh my God, why can't I find one that
[SPEAKER_04]: has the looks, the potency and the aroma?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all segregated in different
combinations and I cannot find them
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really frustrating work to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low population breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other than just inbreeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it's just low population pops
bags, low population pops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like things can get fixed inadvertently
and be kind of like bread, quote unquote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely unintentionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can have traits that get fixed,
you know, and some of them can be good and
[SPEAKER_04]: some of them are bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like the reason it made me think of
that was like DJ's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I always go back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all of my, my thoughts on,
on stuff like that are what I've seen in
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry from a low population playing
around type situation where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was three plants in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: One herms on the other one, one pollinates
two other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mix up the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the next four years,
you cross a sativa type to the indica
[SPEAKER_02]: type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're inbreeding small population,
even though it just, and it turns into
[SPEAKER_02]: variant, but inbred low floor,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you can fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to fix throughout crossing
to the right thing, but not everybody does
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I, at this point, I really like,
like a, for like the future of this kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of stuff, like I don't really think there
is one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what hasn't been crossed to one
of these cookies things?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are we really going to find?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've done it where I like take a nice
cut of blue dream and work it into some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best ones are always like,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like basically blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like reflavoring, you know, but like,
I don't think that there's anything you
[SPEAKER_04]: can like cross to this stuff to really
make it new and exciting for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've just seen a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the farther back you go, the better it
is not forward at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a question originally that
was like, Oh, how do you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote fix or counterpoint it,
but I think you saw a good example of them
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do this using Bodhi's Congolese
cashmere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, that's more like unique and
wild than the Congo cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to run it, you know, so I got to see
what it was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unique, but even in doing that,
I've not heard of anything like insanely
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing coming from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not just shit on Bodhi because
he's a fucking amazing guy doing cool
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where cookies was at, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like what they end up wanting is cause
like I've been in these rooms on these
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding panels where like you do the work
and then someone else gets to pick through
[SPEAKER_04]: it and shit and like catch muck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you do the work, you try and make
something new and unusual and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: what they do?
[SPEAKER_04]: They pick the one that's most like the
modern parent and it'll be the worst cut
[SPEAKER_04]: out of all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just like, that's trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even want to show you that jar,
but I had to because of the way this
[SPEAKER_04]: works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, like why did you pick that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they want to breed with it
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, look at this new thing
we made.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all, it's all trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of it at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, maybe you can find something
that has like a novel aroma, but most of
[SPEAKER_04]: the time it's just like a jacked aroma
from one of the parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you added it to the structure and
this like thing that people like,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think people need to get away from
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the structure of the weed,
like doesn't matter at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because like if I need a seven gram
jar to put an eighth in it because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: larpy, but it's really good, really
nuanced, tasty weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like why does weed have to be rock little,
little rocks, little pebbles and dense?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, why does it have to be purple?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, why does it have to have this
dessert name attached to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that people just don't even,
especially the younger people I talked to,
[SPEAKER_04]: like they don't even really know about
like real diversity in weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that they're looking at all
these names, permanent markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sherb, jealousy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they think that they're all these
distinct things from each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like the way forward is to just
like ask for new things, like actually new
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe don't buy your weed from a
dispensary if you have the option.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like there's a lot of people that
still grow in their homes and in their
[SPEAKER_04]: backyards that don't give a shit about
what's popular and what sells because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: just for them and their family and their
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the like move that I'm trying
to do is just like, I'm going to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: things that I like, make things that I
like, and then I'm going to find the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that jive with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't care about making sales
and like growing something that's
[SPEAKER_04]: guaranteed to make me sales because at the
end of the day, I'm not a one trick pony.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like need to make money off of
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just nice to like do the work and
feel rewarded at the same time or like
[SPEAKER_04]: have it not just like cost you money for
having this like very like consuming
[SPEAKER_04]: hobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we need to get away from this
like fixation on color and density.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that would solve most of the
problems, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still cross GDP into other weird
stuff and like some of these more basal
[SPEAKER_04]: components and get really interesting
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is more or less where I wanted
us to conclude, which is maybe just for
[SPEAKER_00]: fun speculating or reflecting on what
those possibilities are, even like,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, whether it's we talked about
different Urkel OG hybrids earlier on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even like thinking, okay, in an
alternate, in an alternate like timeline
[SPEAKER_00]: where instead of Urkel, there was blue
bonnet, like what would that what would
[SPEAKER_00]: have happened, you know, or any other
thing that's like equally distinctive to
[SPEAKER_02]: trolley to trolley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double Purple Dojo was a big one during
like the late 2000s double purple Dojo
[SPEAKER_02]: based on Blackberry or Blackberry widow,
whatever they were really using.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that stuff is so different and
far removed from what Oracle types are.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could have been a lot of novel cool
shit done with that, like even sub cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as much as people know,
my contentious relationship with a human
[SPEAKER_02]: being was when he was around.
[SPEAKER_02]: The double purple Dojo was insane,
like it was a basically a purple like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackberry version of Apollo 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't really see a lot of Apollo 13
types anymore, especially now that that
[SPEAKER_02]: TGA is temporarily gone, but we're gonna
see a resurgence soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was way different than than any of
the cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you still got like the novel purple,
maybe not as much leaf resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it wasn't geared as much to bubble
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another part of it is like
people just see resin and they think,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, hash, bro, you know, yank it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got the colors, you got unique
turps, you got really potent highs,
[SPEAKER_02]: in many cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chitrali has very similar beautiful
magenta colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just so far out of the realm of
what people are using today.
[SPEAKER_02]: A base, Pakistani, which is essentially,
you know, very similar to an Afghani,
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly different elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could take things in so many
different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just randomly as well, like even if you
kept Urkel, like what it would be like to
[SPEAKER_00]: not use OG, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we we've seen we've seen Urkel Chem
D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs Waltz, is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, loosely, Trace Dog, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not exactly, but you know, like that,
even that's quite different and quite
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, that's a lot of people's
favorite cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cool, cool cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel, I did like a GDP bubble berry that
was really unique back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of my very first crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different things you
could do with GDP and Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even like an Urkel tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like the like the like
banana tie or the juicy fruit tie that was
[SPEAKER_02]: in banana tie across the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be really, really neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two totally different types.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not I just it's like to me,
Urkel wasn't the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not not the thinkers, the everybody trying
to do the same thing and capitalize on the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing really easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me, cookies was very easy to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made everyone look like they could grow
really well because it grew itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that in itself made
everybody start growing it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, I look like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how frosty this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a dank grower, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feed this nitrogen like a tomato all
the time and it still blows up frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's so many different directions
and people are just so sheepish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's turned me on, you know, in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that when I was asking
alternative to cookies, I eat like the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, they're not asking anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a small niche.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even outside of cookies, though,
if you really think about it, it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: people think that nowadays people would
think breeding with OG is probably
[SPEAKER_04]: original.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, once again, like what hasn't
been crossed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't think of a single thing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like if you look back, we're
actually still just using the pieces from
[SPEAKER_04]: previous hyperas where it's like the
purple cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the OGs and then now all the modern
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like that's the only thing I really
care about nowadays is stuff that predates
[SPEAKER_04]: almost all of it, because the rest of it's
already been done and it was done well a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of the times, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you're probably not going to have
the same access to the versions of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cuts that the people that did it really
well when it was around did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just look for 90s weed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to super skunk everything
like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the next thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's almost like a little bit like
souring and everything up or like coming
[SPEAKER_02]: everything up or OG everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's it's the same component in
all those three.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give it like the soapiness sometimes
when you explore the ones in different
[SPEAKER_01]: directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really not that novel or unique,
but it's taking a step back to where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see all the other components that are
in those things and then stuff that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: never seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see
where everyone goes because it's like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: so standardized now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like things only get selected
when they grow a certain way and they
[SPEAKER_04]: flower in a certain time frame and they
respond to nutrients that everyone uses
[SPEAKER_04]: the same now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like like what we've seen now is
and I think it's already there is like
[SPEAKER_04]: like we're all drinking Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it doesn't matter where you buy it
from and like it can have all kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: different names, but it's really the
distinction between like Bud, MGD,
[SPEAKER_04]: Miller, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's like all the same cheap,
shitty beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all the same cheap, shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's grown with no love.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like a lot of times because of the way
testing standards work, you would be
[SPEAKER_04]: appalled to look in the rooms that these
big companies with good reputations have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you need a whole episode on that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's just like it's it's
terrifying, like people that actually love
[SPEAKER_04]: this and actually care about what they
consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they give to other people like
you would all hate to see where it's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can spin it whatever the way they
want with their marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of really horrendous
things that you'll see in a modern grow
[SPEAKER_04]: nowadays and the absolute lack of caring.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that matters is the
schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter what the plant wants,
what would make it excel, what would make
[SPEAKER_04]: it a better product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a schedule to meet.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's pounds that need to be like
shipped out on this date to these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the beaster era all over again,
just with fancy new packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot more money involved,
a lot more corporate money involved,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot more chads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I see it too, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a sad time for commercial weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again, just don't buy like if you
have the opportunity, like don't buy weed
[SPEAKER_04]: from a shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you have the opportunity with your
backyard or your garage or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: like grow some plants for yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even on your first go with some
plants or some seeds that you can buy
[SPEAKER_04]: commercially or as a home grower,
like you're probably going to like that
[SPEAKER_04]: weed so much more than what you're paying
$40 to $60 an eighth at a store for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people would be surprised with what
they can do for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been made to look very inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like seeing all these like 90
lighters, 200 lighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really expensive, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ways to do it small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And efficient and better, you know,
better controls.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have enough space,
you need to see Migra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, or if you like live in an illegal
state still or an illegal portion of the
[SPEAKER_04]: world, like people do it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're even more lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like realistically, like you're more lucky
because then you could get some,
[SPEAKER_02]: some, some money for your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're in a real spot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not, you know, you guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not advocating doing a little stuff by
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, never.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but even so remote, like we don't
really expose even like those market
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures or those weird demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the, those are where the
pockets of diversity usually thrive is
[SPEAKER_04]: where there isn't the substantial market
pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, and what the last frontier in
America is the home grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so like we all need to keep,
keep going with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's some opportunity to like
form just like weed appreciation groups in
[SPEAKER_04]: your community kind of thing, where it's
just like, Hey, like it doesn't cost you
[SPEAKER_04]: anything to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's a very small fee, like on a,
a Patreon thing or a discord thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like, Hey, we all meet up in
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: We share jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little clone swap here and there,
but like, we need to get back to more
[SPEAKER_04]: grassroots methods like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like community based stuff,
because if we just give it away to the
[SPEAKER_04]: corporations, they're going to make you
pay more than full price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't remember paying $60 for an
eighth at a shop during the two 15 era.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a few, but it's like by the end
of the two 15 era, you could get fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: $35 eights top shelf anywhere in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was absolutely killer diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just anything you could want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could go into a shop and pick from a
hundred jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how did we got from there in a short
number of years to basically all the same
[SPEAKER_04]: weed with different marketing packaging,
you know, and it's all full price more so
[SPEAKER_04]: than when it was illegal, even though it's
more overproduced than ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it just doesn't add up to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like artificial.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but this is what I keep trying to
drive home in all these episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you vote with your dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally vote with your dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is trying to explain to people that
there's maybe like seven or eight people
[SPEAKER_02]: on earth with these big collections with
good provenance on these clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's shrinking so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having to make hard fucking
choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you keep, if you, if you're ever
interested in smoking something that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies or gelato, if you're, if you're,
you know, one of those people who doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: just follow the straight line,
like vote with your dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all it's left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't, it'll be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what sucks is that like the kind of
connoisseur part portion of the American
[SPEAKER_04]: weed market is heady bros who buy
expensive fucking dab torches and puffco's
[SPEAKER_04]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, they love the newest,
greatest drop from fucking compound and
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking whoever else, like whoever the big
name of the day is, you know, their own,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I don't understand how the
connoisseur portion of the market is run
[SPEAKER_04]: by people who love the most midsy shit
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's grown well, it's just like,
well, dude, that's not that great a weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, it was tasty, but like,
like, I want to get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think people forgot that the point
of this is to not smoke weed all day and
[SPEAKER_04]: not get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, I want to take one bong rip
and sit down for four hours and like,
[SPEAKER_04]: forget about like the hard shit in my
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's like what I go for,
at least with weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to have to get up five times
during a movie to go re up again,
[SPEAKER_04]: just to be high and like suspend disbelief
and enjoy the show, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so remember when exotics meant
something from like another country that
[SPEAKER_02]: you couldn't get a hold of that was wild
types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it means like, yeah, defines cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking mirrors right in your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope people see through these games that
people are playing to take your dollar out
[SPEAKER_04]: of your pocket and give you the dumpiest
version of something possible for,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then ask them to say thank you,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, yeah, I did want to prompt
you both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think, you know, good,
nice reflection on the state of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're also coming to an end
with regards to cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else that either of you
want to say about cookies parting
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts, parting shots?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for me, it's just like,
it's not, it's not what the last episode
[SPEAKER_02]: said it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were really doing a good job of
laying out like what it is and what it
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of got crushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we had to redo this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you did a really great job,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think what we got this episode
is, yeah, more or less what I wanted last
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the direction it was going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully, hopefully this will be a
good marker for it for people to return
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing is like, I've read the
comments every time we do a cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's cookie bros coming in,
calling me a fucking hater and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the first people using it and
breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, while I don't enjoy it and love
it, I have contributed to the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very transparent about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't realize I was doing it at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I get why some people like it
because it's novel and new to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from a breeding perspective,
I speak about everything from a breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people don't understand that
because they don't breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't explore different lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a breeding perspective, it is a dead
ass end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether they like it or not,
I'm still going to say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say, too,
is that it's like, we've got a mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty, but shitty girlfriend and it's
time to dump her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, so let's move on
collectively as a market and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to find some cool new shit because
it's out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, you got anything you want to plug at
all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some things in the work that I
have planned out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still stuck in this remodel behind me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I get out of here and the next couple
of weeks and get done and moved into this
[SPEAKER_04]: place, then I can actually start working
again and doing cool shit that isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: permanent marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't even talked about it on the
show that you're just doing your own thing
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I got in all the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got dumped by the corporate bros.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was too real, apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're still too nice to, like,
really pull weight on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think we should flex on,
but, you know, that's always at the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the day, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they've tarnished their own
reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to be fun watching them
really stuff that I made.
[SPEAKER_04]: For probably the next two plus years,
you know and so I've already heard a few
[SPEAKER_04]: murmurs from people that I know that still
work there and They're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: did you make this?
[SPEAKER_04]: This was fucking amazing and I'm like,
yeah It's not like interesting to me
[SPEAKER_04]: though none of the work that I did there
was interesting to me at all and so I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: more stoked on the stuff that I have going
now and some of the projects that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: planned for the near future and so Yeah,
maybe maybe a seed line drop which I
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't done in years and I don't know
we're still fiddling around with the
[SPEAKER_04]: reversal sprays and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So We got to get back on track now that
I've lost my workspace, but I have already
[SPEAKER_04]: built my new one So it's just more time
allocation thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm proud of how you handled it I you
know, like I've lost jobs where it's your
[SPEAKER_02]: livelihood whether you loved it or not
It's your livelihood and you have to make
[SPEAKER_02]: big changes and you handled it like a
fucking man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you No, I mean I bought a house a
month before I got Yeah, and I got to keep
[SPEAKER_04]: spending money to like make it nice Yeah,
you know, so it's like one of those things
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's just like, yep, but luckily
I've already got new work and Out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: weed industry and so it's much more
rewarding and I'm already happier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So But couldn't have done it I've been
gotten a lot of support from that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you love you I Don't think I had too much
to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I am By this point Matt would have
had an out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Matt would have mentioned the 10k
subscribers thing So just yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in reality when we're recording this
this is just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bit of you know, timey-wimey stuff
Yeah, so still thinking about that still
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked about that very satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew we would get there Of course,
it was just a matter of when but yeah I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: stoked about that I wrote this really long
nice thing on Instagram, by the way Follow
[SPEAKER_02]: us at I think it's what is it the dot
breeders dot syndicate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's the one that I have now
Or I'm sorry breeders dot syndicate dot
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it Yeah, we'll put it in the
description IG sniped our page because
[SPEAKER_02]: people obviously report us because what I
say conflicts with their money-making
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes, you know we lost
everything that had to do with the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: on there, but we do have the new one up
and I wrote about doing like a nice You
[SPEAKER_02]: know a cool contest giveaway with
everybody who's following on Instagram Do
[SPEAKER_02]: something cool to you know for the 10k
subscribers on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a do a contest there and then one for
the patreon as well something really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: for all our patreon discord people just to
celebrate like hitting 10k that was a big
[SPEAKER_02]: big milestone and Yeah, I mean thousand
was the driving part behind that like I
[SPEAKER_02]: that just seemed so unrealistic When he
first came in to like 10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, bro, that'll be like nine years
around Shit till then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so thank you honestly I just I did
want to say I think just quickly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: response to that like I think when I
Started helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just knew that all I had to do was keep
going for a bit longer and it would work I
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of was fully confident that if
we could still have some of our good
[SPEAKER_00]: people around us and Still make the show
it makes us more sustainable that we would
[SPEAKER_00]: just get there and I think we actually
doubled the subs in six months I think
[SPEAKER_00]: when I first started helping we were at
like four or five K.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, I I'm still pretty amazed
that we got there in half a year But I was
[SPEAKER_00]: also hoping that that's how long it would
take.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah Yeah, you know, I mean like a lot
of people don't know but I was ready to
[SPEAKER_02]: clock out Like on the whole show is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm not happy with the
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not happy with what's being said I'm
not saying anything It wasn't just about
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a lot of misinformation and I
couldn't stop some of it and I was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really done and Without thousand
this show wouldn't exist right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could say that confidently super
confident.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have kept doing it It would not
be consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, and I will say as well like I'm
also just a proxy for people like Dan
[SPEAKER_00]: local earn Little hill cushion the Giants
peaches You know probably many other
[SPEAKER_00]: people I've forgotten to mention but you
know, everyone Everyone helped me too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so and helped us and so being
able to Get our friends on and help them
[SPEAKER_00]: support us was just huge as well And I
think once we made it more of a group
[SPEAKER_00]: effort It just changed the vibe as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in a nice way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Made it easier for me to and it
gave me a lot more hope for the future
[SPEAKER_02]: generations Like I was jaded as hell like
it's really easy to get very jaded and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuck in your ways and like just being
like I don't want to talk about new stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to meet new people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't trust anyone like it's all gone
bad every time and every time anything's
[SPEAKER_02]: grown it went bad, so It's it's it's a
nice surprise It's been really awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: great experience Yeah with that We have
the sub Rob drop on riot seeds For those
[SPEAKER_02]: of you don't know sub Rob is like one of
the most legit dudes I know from IC bag
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the days a sandy of this finest
him grayskull his crew You know sour dub
[SPEAKER_02]: went through there gg4 went through there
all the earliest shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a release of Super silver haze 98
cut cross to sour dub and then a skunk dog
[SPEAKER_02]: S1 across the sour dub.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling the SSA SSH super silver
haze cross to sour dub.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're calling it SSSDH.

[SPEAKER_02]: episode airs That's my proudest blueberry
work was the blueberry IX stuff in cross
[SPEAKER_02]: means we took it another generation and
I'm super stoked on it I'm super stoked
[SPEAKER_02]: and I and I got to stoke someone else out
who was a super blueberry head from Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't believe in any of that like
it was really possible that this blueberry
