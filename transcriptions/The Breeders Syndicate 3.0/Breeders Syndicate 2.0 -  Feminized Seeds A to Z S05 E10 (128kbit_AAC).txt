Hello,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got that right, kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of a smooth transition,
but not so smooth, but it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are live.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone, for showing up today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to remove the background from
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll eventually figure all this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my co-host, not-so-dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this week, we're doing a show on
feminization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to try to go through
feminized seeds A to Z, what they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: why they are, some of the mechanics of how
it works as far as the biosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how to make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where should we start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I bring in my presentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know if we should start
with the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get to see how many?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, we chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was almost going to break your rule
there for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, we chat for a second until
people join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see how many people join?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The live on the YouTube is going to be way
different than the live on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be drastically different in
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the presentation is the
gig or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could just start by the first
feminized seeds that I ever knew of were
[SPEAKER_00]: just herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of false information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to think of herms as like an
accident before we really understood the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasoning behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used to think that if you used herm
seeds, you could permeate the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With future herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was pretty much, I think,
the first feminized breeding that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people ever did was accidental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to grow seedless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And figured out that if stress or if they
let their plants run long, that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they pop them, they tended to be
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think people realized at that
time, I didn't, certainly, that those were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just like an afterthought or
something they might have noticed after
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact, after planting them several
times when it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you only get a handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just think that like you just
didn't get a boy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on your side for once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we also call that bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bag seed is sort of the backbone of
the elite cuts history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of bag seed, too, is from
leftover males.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's not all feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all bag seed is feminized bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, like you would say that like in
imports and stuff like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them get pollinated by straight
males all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, but that was that was that's
sort of the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for a long time, most of my
breeding career, really, it was what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only way that people did
things for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recall reading about or knowing
anyone except for some very weird
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments trying to make feminine seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people would just stress out a
plant and try to get it to make pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was I think that was probably like
one of the most common things that was
[SPEAKER_00]: tried in like feminine seed infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mohan Ram and his partner did some work in
1982 with feminized sex reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first paper was written in 1982 on
the the feminized sex reversals using
[SPEAKER_01]: silver nitrate and sodium thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tried a bunch of different
things, but they found that in a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration that the best results came
from using a combination of silver nitrate
[SPEAKER_01]: and sodium thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would use the silver nitrate to get
the action, the ethylene blocking action
[SPEAKER_01]: and the sodium thiosulfate to keep it from
being as phototoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never did it right.
Phototoxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the man we kind of owe our our
whole feminized heritage to as far as,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, developing the process,
trying it out, figuring out what works
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes as far back as 1982.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't quite see that start coming
into the cannabis world until if I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember correctly, Dutch Passion was the
one who started pushing it real big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started defining the term feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of saying that they were all
female seeds, they would call it feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: just in case you got a male or two popping
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to denote that it wasn't
always going to be female, as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe people should know, too,
that when when that first started
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, being Dutch, they kept what
they were doing very close to the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was zero explanation given or way of
how they were achieving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of aspiring breeders and
things like that, there wasn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there wasn't an easy reference
of anywhere to go on how to what what to
[SPEAKER_00]: use, how to do it, a process, you know,
mixing instructions, any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was held pretty tightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they tended to hold things much
tighter than a lot of other communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And notably so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, every time that they seem to share
clones, like every single Dutch seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company would have it the next year and be
competing with it in the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was kind of a reason that they
did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it carried on into other avenues and
areas, even when it came to like
[SPEAKER_01]: breakthroughs in different technology for
cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think, too, that, you know,
for a long time as well, the technology
[SPEAKER_00]: was unknown and it was also sort of looked
down upon as cheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis enthusiasts, for the most
part, did not look at it as a particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: viable method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they thought the male and female
method was everything everyone needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but, you know, in other forms of
breeding and certainly in other in other
[SPEAKER_00]: industries and agriculture and stuff,
reversals, feminine seed, S1s,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all that kind of stuff have a
long history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the agricultural standard to
breed using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to, yeah, consistency,
uniformity, dependability, all aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to lock in certain traits
and have those be dependable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, farmers need to know what they're
growing each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to make sure that each one's
going to stand up to whatever is coming,
[SPEAKER_01]: being thrown at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't have a bunch of diversity,
you know, and that's that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a commercial business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think what happened is,
is there was a cultural shift in that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 70s and 80s and certainly a decent
chunk of the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of people, it was a seed
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would just buy seeds and you would
grow seeds and you would kill the males or
[SPEAKER_00]: remove them and you would grow the
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you'd make seed,
but you were growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then clones started becoming more
popular as people found certain special
[SPEAKER_00]: specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that led to is, you know,
the first wave of so on elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that led to breeding with those
elites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we covered a lot of those elites in a
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we called it the cannabis Bible
clone list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do a YouTube search for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can find that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happened if I take my male
lines and I start breeding them to these
[SPEAKER_00]: elites that have all these qualities that
people like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened, I think,
with Dutch passion, too, is as in Holland
[SPEAKER_00]: and Amsterdam, as they started to lose
actual lines but still had clones
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they went feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a way to like, you know, maybe they
don't have a line of it anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they still have a few select cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they also they did look at it
as a way of keeping other breeders from
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding with their line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that was big with the white widow,
like feminizing the white widow,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was because they wanted to make sure that
people couldn't use their white widow cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to make it theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could make it like theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's only female, you won't have a
male to make your seeds with.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, in fact, we all know that you can
take a plant from a feminized seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse it, use that pollen just as well
as any clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I will say back then now that is
as the industry has shifted now,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very wide knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before, I think it was not wide
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably for some years protected
them just because, I mean, I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it ICMAG?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what year it was where
people started posting an actual recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe CSI said it was originally on
old Canna World or Cannabis World or
[SPEAKER_01]: Evergrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always attributed it to Fett because
that's where I first saw it was when Fett
[SPEAKER_01]: would pass it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it goes back much further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's someone who actually that I
forgot what it was like 5 to 2.5 is what
[SPEAKER_01]: we call it the recipe where it's five
milligrams silver nitrate to 2.5
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams sodium thiosulfate mix for the
stock solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the old recipe that someone and
I regret it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can figure out from CSI,
I'll update it in the show notes there so
[SPEAKER_01]: people can have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, it's gone from sort of
being the cheating undesirable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, this breeder is feminizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's lost his mojo to being the industry
standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where regular seeds now are very
rare compared to feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been basically a sea change,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it in a lot of other
episodes where like the first,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say even 10 years of making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came off the bat making feminine
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I started with as far as seeds
that I was selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making fem seeds and selling them
just off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first 10 years, I was told
constantly daily emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ruining the cannabis fucking genome
that it's going to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ruining it for good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking males out is GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this isn't natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not nature's way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are all kinds of different
reasoning that people would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost like this religious belief
that they had like God made it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to tinker with it your way
and it's going to be Satan bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the way I felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about it when you were
talking about the part about like having
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other seed companies steal the
work the next year because you just buy
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seeds and then you have the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when people think of GMO,
I would say that probably the first name
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes to mind is probably Monsanto,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made, they famously got around
that issue by breeding specifically for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so that their stuff was sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've seen this in cannabis as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked about because there's a,
there's a problem and Neville,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single breeder has talked about it
where there is no, there is no,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way to control your genetic
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've released a line to the
public, it's just out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only, the only system that
regulates who does what with it after that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the honor system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all know, we all know like from
theory and practice that once you let a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone out of your hands, once it leaves
the one spot that it exists, once two
[SPEAKER_01]: people hold it, everyone holds it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all learned that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's that, it's that old saying,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like three people can keep a secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: If two of them are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but the other part that I will
say to that, and this is a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tangent, so I apologize, but, um,
you know, using the OG for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: which had like an enormous, uh,
impact on Southern California and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis market in general,
if greedy people hadn't sold it and leaked
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it probably never would have gotten as
famous as it did because there would only
[SPEAKER_00]: have been a tiny group of people that had
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the issues that we had with the
chem dog back in the day was there was
[SPEAKER_00]: like four garages in California growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just wasn't very much market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it never really could build because it
didn't leak out fast and get everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and have this huge wave of everyone having
it so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like, it was like here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it took Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a weird thing between
people don't want it to leak too fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: too far and make it worthless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it doesn't leak enough where
there's actual available flower of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can't ever catch on as a, as a weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw that with the clockwork orange in
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we tried to keep that in the hog's
breath super tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason we ever saw hog's
breath take off the way it did was because
[SPEAKER_01]: James got it, had a collective called
unified collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had he not had that collective and had
it not gotten big, I'm not sure the hog's
[SPEAKER_01]: breath would have blown up like it was
because it wasn't in a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, and if you're, if you have
something really special that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of gets out there,
you can get a little bit of buzz with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and people want it, but you don't fulfill
that with flower ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people never get to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just, that, that is a hype that dies
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, you know, or another level is it
becomes legendary enough now that like
[SPEAKER_00]: people can, can, you know, offer high
priced, whatever on it, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough people out there that can call
bull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asian fantasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: One person ever has had this close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never gotten rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never let anybody have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to this day, I still see Asian fantasy
in collectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually, it went so far as to make
itself totally unpopular because nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: else could really get ahold of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it became so rare that it
proliferated fakes eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's funny is way back in the
day, sometimes when we would try to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: people chem dog, uh, the funny thing about
brokers and people like that is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would diss it sometimes because they were
so connected pretty much all of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: weed they see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they were unfamiliar with it,
it couldn't be that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, just so everybody knows too,
this, this YouTube is much better,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't see comments this week,
the way Matt can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if, if, uh, if you're asking me things
and I don't see them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he can't see anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I w I don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll type for him anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, getting, getting back to the,
to the sort of the, the focus of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, um, you know, even before feminine,
I see people started just releasing elite
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and in hybrids only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they didn't want to give out the
pure line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to release it mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then feminine, I started coming along,
like he said, with Dutch passion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think in America, it really
started spreading to anybody using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt can correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's way more into it than I am on this
one, but probably like, oh, seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh eight, oh nine era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was six, oh seven, oh eight,
oh nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and a little bit before with hive,
obviously hive was a big proponent of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of reversals in, in doing feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, uh, there were people like golden
eyes doing at suppose it S ones of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should clarify and is,
and say that like, as feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: started hitting the market where cannabis
members, you know, cannabis people could
[SPEAKER_00]: get access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there was some experiments,
going on like, and there was certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say like before this
date, no one was doing it because that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but as far as like a marketable thing
where people were, you know, selling
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was about that time,
like oh six and on, but realistically,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there was, there was never a time up
until the last few years, uh, the past
[SPEAKER_01]: five, six, seven years where you weren't
getting insulted to do it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were looked at as like the
bastard child of the cannabis industry for
[SPEAKER_01]: making those available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people would, people would give,
uh, Caleb about a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good friends would, would bullshit with
you or with him or with whoever that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, that they were making
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, Oh, only the untalented do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the short, that's the easy
shortcut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's selecting the male that that's,
that's where the real breeding comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the real, that was usually
the propaganda for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, like most propaganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pretty good amount of truth in
it in the sense that when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting males, it is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, and, um, and, but,
you know, I don't think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to joke with you or whatever that
like all my regular breeding, I never had
[SPEAKER_00]: a single failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're using regular males,
uh, it's really hard to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can only, you only need a
few of them and they produce a copious
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of pollen and you can have heavily
seed your entire room pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and never had male failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, the, the art of, uh,
regular seed breeding is like fans and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bamboo stake and beating the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cutting the mail off and shaking it
above the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely basic and successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you know, uh, Matt can talk about
at length and some of our friends getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the feminized process is a lot trickier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's certainly uncertain in terms of
if it will work, how many seeds it will
[SPEAKER_00]: make, how much pollen there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of the actual act of getting
the, the, the fertilization happening is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of like the name of the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of nuance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this show is going to be Matt
talking about some of that nuance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about first, why,
why feminize seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, why would this be a tool in any
breeder's tool belt?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what are the advantages?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the disadvantages?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, a feminized seed is a seed
made with using only female pollen that
[SPEAKER_01]: has been induced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, technically you can induce it in many
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can induce it stress, chemical,
um, or I mean, even I guess that's it,
[SPEAKER_01]: stress or chemical because letting it
flower extra long is still the stress kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of trait for it to throw those,
uh, for those male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to interrupt too much,
but you could probably throw in genetic as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some things like ties and
some different strains that seem to herm
[SPEAKER_00]: easily and often, even when happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intersects, natural intersects plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely exist in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, this trait exists in
cannabis originally because the main goal
[SPEAKER_01]: of a cannabis plant isn't for us to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in its, in its system, its main,
its main purpose is to make more seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: carry on its, its genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing so somehow, some way it has a
trait in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's a correct word,
but it has the ability to detect if there
[SPEAKER_01]: are males around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, and it knows that it's going
to be dying soon or unable to make seed
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will start making its own male parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with, even if it's missing the male
chromosome, it will use its environment to
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate its own hormonal system and
kick out male parts to make essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: female only chromosome to pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you end up with in the seeds is a
single chromosome plant only female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can look like two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it can look like what we call,
you know, our, our, our general term for
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the cannabis industry is bananas,
uh, which are basically like little
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow, uh, pollen sacks that pop out of
fem, of female bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they contain a small amount of pollen,
realistically speaking, but there can be
[SPEAKER_00]: many of them and they typically,
little anthers and they just grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we, they get called bananas
because they're little yellow curved
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's the most common trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: type of hermaphrodite, but there is also
hermaphrodism where some part of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or even out of a maturing female flower,
you will get actual male parts grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and when you do reversals,
a lot of people don't realize this until
[SPEAKER_01]: they actually perform it and see it in
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're spraying a female plant,
when it turns, when it starts growing male
[SPEAKER_01]: parts, it does not grow male parts like a
male does, like we're used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in cannabis, when we have males,
we're used to seeing the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the parts grew up in like the elbows
or armpits, you know, right there,
[SPEAKER_01]: hang lower, you know, they, they grow up
and hang lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what happens in a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps the structure of the female like
a bud and groups the flowers super tight,
[SPEAKER_01]: the male parts super tight and balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't necessarily hang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sometimes, you know, successful
reversal, they'll kind of extend it,
[SPEAKER_01]: hang a little bit and droop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that it's very pretty,
you know, easy for it to drop pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, but most of the time,
most of the time in a reversal,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're using a chemical reversal,
it'll, it, it'll be very hard for it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to uncluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times you'll need to use
tweezers and pick them out by hand and
[SPEAKER_01]: shake the little pollen out in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, there are a lot of tedious,
uh, things you have to do sometimes to
[SPEAKER_01]: coax pollen out of a, a reversed,
uh, female because of the way the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: structure is much different than a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it, uh, uh, I am almost think of
it like, is the flowers packed so tight
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can't open up and drop pollen
the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like from my conversations with
Matt and other friends of ours,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does seem to me like over the next
decades or so, we probably will continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn a lot more about how to
successfully reverse cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis obviously since feminine seed are
the most common way that people breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people have had a lot of success with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is very hit or miss failures are
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even successful, um, successful can be
anything from like a light dusting of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen that you get a few seeds to a
heavily seeded room where you're extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: happy at the number of seeds that you got
or anything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the one thing to note,
and a lot of people don't understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm going to cover this a little bit
more in depth later, but one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons why you'll see feminine seeds tend
to cost more is because even when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: those like extreme successes where it
seems to get you a lot of seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always less than you would get from a
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always, always.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never get as much pollen from a
reverse plant as you would a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like a lot of people always say,
why are they more expensive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the failure and it's the amount of
seeds you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even, you know, just to use an
example, I think when, uh, when CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed the, the triangle, um,
he failed twice and then he used,
[SPEAKER_00]: he used one specific spray and had
success, but he only got about 10 or 15%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the volume of seeds that he would
normally expect on a well done reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had other friends of ours,
um, you know, our buddy PIP or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: that reversed, uh, his sour diesel cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he never even got a saleable
amount of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would get, he got a few dozen,
you know, 50 or, you know, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so sometimes it can be essentially a
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in the sense, you know, and,
and then you go, you go, you go hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: through a bunch of weed, uh, and you find
a few dozen seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be pretty frustrating in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially the why, why would you make
feminine seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: One, if you want to have a pure version of
a, of a specific, of a specific line,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say you have a deep chunk,
but you don't have any males at the deep
[SPEAKER_01]: chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to make, you want to have a
pure seed line of deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you have left is one deep chunk
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no access to any males at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could either hybridize it,
bring in outside genetic material,
[SPEAKER_01]: a male and cross it, and then take the
generations forward and select toward the
[SPEAKER_01]: deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could reverse another deep chunk,
or you could take a clone of the same deep
[SPEAKER_01]: chunk, reverse that onto another clone of
that same deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make seeds with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be pure deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time all the work going forward
has already been done as far as making it
[SPEAKER_01]: purely deep chunk and look deep chunk and
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great for having a really pure
seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's great for people who,
especially when a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I see them buy feminine seeds,
they tend to be buying feminine seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: because they have a plant count in
whatever state or country that they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can only have so many things
growing and they can't afford to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: using pots, container space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light the money, electricity on males.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't keep, you know, building up a
nice even canopy if they're constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: yanking males out and having to replace
those with a new seedling and popping it,
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a lot of cases, feminine seeds do
real well, especially in Europe early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really popular because there are a
lot of smaller apartment and house grows
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with the open, the open market of the
hemp industry, we've seen feminine seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and auto flowering seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, really take hold in that market as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, auto flowering has always kind of
been looked down by on by breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, mainly because there was a lot of
problems getting good ruderalis hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: out there, uh, early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, there are companies that
supposedly do a really good job with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't tried any, but I'm sure they
do much better than we used to back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, the feminized thing is,
is definitely a staple since the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: times people are, are definitely,
I think it's becoming more comfortable in
[SPEAKER_01]: America ever since the hemp market opened
that people are more comfortable talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about buying feminine seeds and trying to
get the real science behind it now,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to even five, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could also say too,
that like on a commercial level,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, when you start growing acres
of, of weed of any kind, uh, if you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you, you end up having to hunt a
lot for males to, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really hard to get people
to keep male stock for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's say you're moving houses or
moving rooms and you know, your friends
[SPEAKER_01]: offer to keep your clones for you and you
want to get them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard for people to be like,
yeah, I'll take that male for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause nobody really wants males kicking in
their room, taking up space, possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinating their, their flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of advantages to having
this, uh, this tool in your tool belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as a collector, it's hard enough
to get people to back up, uh, females you
[SPEAKER_00]: love that aren't currently popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much less a male that they're never going
to bloom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that kind of breaks down the why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that kind of covers it
unless you have anything else on the why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little bit of color to what you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when Matt was talking about
selfing and S ones, I would say that the
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority of elites that we have out
there on the cannabis space today,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, are not lines anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're specific clones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the cool tools about it is,
um, it's not perfect, uh, but by selfing
[SPEAKER_00]: a, a, you know, clone only, if you were,
you can get an idea of what else might be
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can tell you a lot about the
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, does it have a lot of diversity in
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pretty narrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, like what kind of traits
does it tend to pop?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's imperfect, but in a lot of
cases from old elite cuts that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: held from the nineties or the two
thousands, it's our only way to get a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's simply are no males in
existence that we know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no regular seed sitting out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you only have the one example of what
that genetics holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by out crossing it, you're never sure
what's, you know, what the other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows, it allows you to like look
within a line and you, we draw a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: inferences now these days from what S ones
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells us information about the mother
plant that we might not have otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important for people to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I think Matt would probably agree
here that consistency usually comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: out crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're going to get whack and weird
shit in most S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you can, you, you have a much
better chance with S ones of looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: individual plants you want to keep as new
moms that might be amazing, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency might be all over the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you get high, high highs and low
lows, I think is the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get more junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get more hermaphrodism than
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so out process using feminine seed or
more stable, but S ones give you a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a glimpse into a line that might be your
only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's important to note that like
S ones might give you more, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the high highs and low lows, but taking
the, it just a single generation further,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas in the F one generation and taking
it another generation further makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: more diverse with S twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it tightens the lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're bringing correctly, it tightens
the lineup, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and, and so on S three,
even more tight, even more tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breeds true to type essentially when
you're doing further generations of
[SPEAKER_01]: selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also, the more
generations of selfing, sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they talk about plants getting
weaker or unhappier because what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is there are experiences where the
more you self something, the deeper you
[SPEAKER_00]: go, uh, the more undesirable recessive
start popping up too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a tool and it's a cool tool
because for most, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: most old elites, we have one or two clones
surviving and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good way to keep those in a,
in a form that you can keep reproducing
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep stored in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even when you're, you're down and
growing, let's say you want to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation, you can at least re-access that
genetic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it might not be identical,
you can at least get that genetic material
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you pop it off, you'll find
something very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's pretty much the color that
I would add to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the why, the why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Femininity seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went over the what they are,
uh, simply, simply put, it's a breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blocking of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're reversing a female,
you want to block the ethylene so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: gibberellin flows through freely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, on the flip side, when you want to
reverse a male, you wouldn't use the same
[SPEAKER_01]: product or chemicals that you would to
reverse a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're reversing a male and people do
do this, um, you would use something like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you, you want to block the gibberellin
and spray ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, give, give it a little more
ethylene, which is like ethyphon or
[SPEAKER_01]: floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are actually looking down that
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would say when it comes to
feminizing, when people first asked me
[SPEAKER_01]: what to do, I'd say step one, you procure
a recipe earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the recipe that I've
referred to as vet's recipe, but someone
[SPEAKER_01]: else wrote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which I, again, is the five grams to
two, what is it, or 0.5 grams to 2.5
[SPEAKER_01]: grams, uh, silver to sodium thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the old recipe and that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be the most effective recipe
any longer, but it will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're, if you're short on funds,
any of that, that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get those chemicals fairly
affordably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and remember when you do make the
stock solution using that recipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: always keep your stock solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the undiluted mixture in the
fridge until ready to mix and spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: This ensures a long, stable shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if your spray has been sitting
longer than two weeks, it's imperative
[SPEAKER_01]: that you shake it like you mean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aggressively shake and mix that silver
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some bottles, it can cling to the
surface of the plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is expected or expected and an
active amount is adjusted to account for
[SPEAKER_01]: the average amount lost from sitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using the right reversal spray,
but if you're making it from your own,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep that in mind when you store it,
when it sits in the stock solution
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles, silver will build up and not come
off very well off the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even if you do mix it, there's,
there's a certain amount of loss,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you want to adjust for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the planning session, here's,
here's where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I want to reverse?
[SPEAKER_01]: What plant do I want to receive the
pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we beat the odds of sterile
reversals?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is everything introduced to the same
room all at once?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all things to think about when
you're building your plan for doing your
[SPEAKER_01]: first reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to do it in a tent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to do it in a big open field?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to be outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be inside?
[SPEAKER_01]: All these are super, super important to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so what plant do I want to reverse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's, let's pick one for example,
not so let's say we are going to reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: the LA Kush, the headband LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to reverse that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What plant do we want to receive the
pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to make S ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to be hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I would say, I, you know,
obviously it like depends on people's
[SPEAKER_00]: personal goals, but I would say like most
people, um, want to make some amount of S
[SPEAKER_00]: ones to trap the clone only in a seed
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not contaminated by external,
external genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it usually is a combination of
crossing it to other clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or other clones that are currently
popular that you think will hit a market,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a question someone asked,
um, and this is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't S is an S one a reversal
technically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all reversals are not all S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, F we refer to like, if you're
hybridizing something, let's, so in this
[SPEAKER_01]: example, let's say you're reversing Chem D
onto the LA Kush, it's still going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized, but it's not considered a self
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's considered an F one reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's the way we refer to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to point that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not sure if that's the actual
answer to the question you had,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know that's one thing that a lot of
people confused and call like F like F one
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids of reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They refer to them as S ones and that's
not quite correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it is a self thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you're reversing the planet,
but it's not selfing it or pollinating
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so people know, I can't see
comments in this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't figured that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't get your question
answered, it's Matt's fault entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our one is, uh, our one is for
recombinant genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that we are not even
discussing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, it's not our one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, see, how do we beat the odds of
sterile reversals?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the one thing that I talk about
when I talk about reversals, me and me and
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI probably spend more hours discussing,
uh, reversals than anything else that we
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about, um, trying to beat the odds
of, of when a plant will reverse all
[SPEAKER_01]: plants do reverse, not all plants drop
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even that said, I'm speaking very
generally when I did that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: 3000 plant reversal, I remember there were
two plants in a hemp field that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just stayed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normal sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, they were, they just were not
chemically able at that rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a high rate to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it is possible that plants will not
reverse, but very, very rare two in 3000
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that gives you an idea of how rare and
that was in hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where was I at?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we beat the odds of sterile
reversal?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we figured out was maybe reversing
one plant and rolling all the dice on one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, one big plant to produce a lot of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't the idea, maybe it was smaller
plants and more of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we started beating the odds
and getting reversals to, to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be more predictable, you know,
instead of a, a single plant in a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pot taking up, you know,
a whole light reversing it and failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we put, you know, 50 clones in a bunch
of small pots in a single section under a
[SPEAKER_01]: single light reverse all of them,
the odds say you're bound to get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that's, that's really how we beat
the odds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Numbers beat the odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could throw in something that I've
noticed and that pretty much comes when
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever asked Matt or CSI or anybody
else that does a bunch of reversals as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as like what, uh, what the methods are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's frustrating about it is that to
me, it seems like they can get a very
[SPEAKER_00]: successful reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, on a strain and they can go to make
those same seeds again, and they can do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything measured out exactly the same
that they did before and get a different
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so sometimes they'll have a
situation where they'll have like 10
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that they're reversing and like,
you know, they started doing more numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: just because a couple of them will fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will partially do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this many will actually
successfully do it and throw off X amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are plants all within the same
tiny little micro climate too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people don't understand this,
like it, we really don't understand why,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if it's the angle of light changed by
X amount, like they're all getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: same amount of spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's so similar, the same feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it'll just be that some do
and some don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could in a, in a situation that I'm
familiar with regular seed breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put a couple of males of the same
thing into a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be guaranteed that they would produce
enough pollen to, uh, pollinate the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, these they've developed an
enormous amount of strategies in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: get enough pollen to pollinate the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, every single failure is,
is very expensive and a shout out to AJ
[SPEAKER_01]: Gucci, our very first super chat ever
since we did monetized on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the five bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the next question, and this is
probably where it gets the most
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated is everything introduced all
at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 3000 plants of hemp Kush that
we're reversing onto 13,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that, that I would do choose
that many is because of the ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure we have enough pollen
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, in this situation, this
hypothetical situation, it's hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I've learned with hemp,
which is very different from my experience
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis is that there's no staggering
when you're introducing everything to be
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this scenario with hemp in this big
reversal, I did, we started by reversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say a thousand plants first,
the first week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two weeks later, we started
reversing another thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a half a week later, we started
the last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand and at that, at that last week of
that last half week, we introduced all the
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause usually there's about a two and a
half week stagger between when you start
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing the plants and initiating into
flower, the ones that are going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's usually about two and a half,
two to two and a half weeks before you
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce the females that are going to
catch the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the hemp reversal, it started going
off almost immediately upon flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is it, it reversed so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it takes three and a half to four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking 24 to 28 days to see
balls and not even, not even to begin to
[SPEAKER_01]: drop pollen, but just to see balls three
and a half to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, with this hemp reversal in three
and a half weeks, they were dropping
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer to is everything introduced
all at once is it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know the plants you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always recommend if you, if this is a do
or die scenario, make sure you know this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and have done test reversals and all
that, because you can lose a lot of money
[SPEAKER_01]: gambling on a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is me talking about the three to
five, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with our spray, there's two different
instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and this is, this is going to be with
any kind of SDS base.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can choose to spray daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, you know, once a day,
you can choose to spray once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can choose to spray once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'd never recommend spraying once on
the first time because it's hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason I impressed that you can,
you can spray once and have a reversal is
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of times people will
practice this in a room and they only want
[SPEAKER_01]: to reverse one plant and they're spraying
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not seeing all the overspray
going on all their other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden they've got like five
or six strains that they're reversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they only had overspray once.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it only takes once to flip a plant
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is no set recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes doing it once a week works
better than doing it once a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes once a day is too much and
causes it to cluster too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much of the hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, everything is very, very variant
with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of work to find that sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single clone and every single
time you use every single clone is a
[SPEAKER_01]: different experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're spraying, we're less
concerned with covering every leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're more concerned with hitting the
nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the armpits, elbows, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we want to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't necessarily need to spray all
over the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a waste of the spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It mainly needs it in the nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also recommend keeping as much of
the spray in stock solution form as you
[SPEAKER_01]: can and only mixing exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Refrigeration is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention, because Matt
hasn't yet, is as far as I'm aware,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant doesn't like the spray that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so especially if you want to go with a
single spray or a couple of strong sprays
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's it, you could definitely think
that you hurt your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while you are going to,
hopefully your goal is to successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: induce male flowers, but the process to
get there can be a little rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also when you start spraying,
it immediately stops stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things to consider too,
because a lot of people are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, I'm going to flip it now
and then it will stretch X amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll expect it to be this big by the time
I've done spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start spraying, it immediately
starts squatting, making that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch just gets really slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills stretch quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind for height,
for space requirement, for how big you
[SPEAKER_01]: want the plant to be when it starts
dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to be as big as it's going to
be before you start spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think that covers the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screwston asks, does the spray you have
made have to be put back in the fridge
[SPEAKER_01]: every day in between sprays or just make
enough for each day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said in the presentation,
keep your stock solution by itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: make enough for each spray, always keep
the stock solution in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really need to put the dilute
solution in the fridge as long as you use
[SPEAKER_01]: it within the next few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the stock solution can last as long
as, I mean, we've had people keep it four
[SPEAKER_01]: years and use it and it's totally fine as
long as they kept it in the fridge and
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed it well afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a long shelf life if you give it
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some mystery to it too in the
sense that Matt's offering up the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt has a spray himself that he offers
that's his own tweaks on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple other gentlemen that do
it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strangely, it seems like with Matt's
and other people's, sometimes that one
[SPEAKER_00]: type of spray seems to be the winner for a
specific reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only time I've ever heard of
anybody having any trouble was with
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally what we found is you have to
kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to kill it to get it to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is almost dead before you reverse
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that I've learned is the one
spray that was being used was very
[SPEAKER_01]: phototoxic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very phototoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually a sign of no sodium
thiosulfate and strong sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be that whatever the sodium
thiosulfate was doing was inhibiting how
[SPEAKER_01]: much the the silver nitrate was actually
getting in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's damaging it, it wanted
more and more and more and thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can always adjust your spray
ratios to compensate for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of you could play with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Play with the spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't necessarily need sodium
thiosulfate to accomplish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, silver nitrate reverses just fine
on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does really burn plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really hurts them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the plants that we reverse,
we're not worried about how pretty they
[SPEAKER_01]: are or how pretty they're going to look or
how much resin they're going to throw.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only worried about pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times that means a really
ugly burn up plant to get to that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very helpful because a lot of
people, I think, would look at it and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's supposed to reverse
and stay gorgeous looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number one question that we get,
are feminized seeds more likely to herm?
[SPEAKER_01]: No and yes and no is the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, everything varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the breeder is using a clone that tends
to be sexually stable, even in highly
[SPEAKER_01]: stressful situations, the chance of
intersex traits will not be increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, if a person makes seeds,
whether regular or feminized, with a
[SPEAKER_01]: sexually unstable clone, the likelihood is
increased that the resulting progeny will
[SPEAKER_01]: be intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moral of the story, know your seed maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone making seeds is a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just throw in my traditional take
on herms, which is everyone complains
[SPEAKER_00]: about this one trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, hermaphrodism is a very
successful breeding method that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has used for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've decided to start breeding it out
in the last 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people were growing seeded pounds
from Colombia or Thailand or Panama or
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico or wherever, they didn't care about
hermaphrodites because their weed was
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can be thankful, but at least there are
companies like Seed Flunky and Cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing herms back into the gene pool
with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that it's misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can certainly breed towards it on
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people giving colloidal silver
recipes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend colloidal silver to
anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been scientifically proven that it's
very subpar to silver nitrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium thinosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can try.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have access to silver
nitrate, there's a recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's put up in here, 500 PPMs for
colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try it at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, silver is the action for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other different chemicals you
can use, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one that we tried for a little bit
called Retain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other methods of action that
aren't silver-based that are very
[SPEAKER_01]: effective, but it's very complicated and
super expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to look for any new comments in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible to get a male and feminine
seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, I admittedly was a big
proponent because I'd see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would see males and femseeds pop up
every now and then, some lines more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, I noticed that if people were
having them tested, they were coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it seems like is when you see a plant
showing male parts from femseeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: typically what you're seeing is a plant
that is expressing male for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a male plant by
chromosomal status, but it is a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: showing male parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible to see a plant showing male
parts from feminine seeds, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and showing only male and being truly,
not very many female parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is possible to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like cannabis is, for the most
part, pretty sexually fluid, but it should
[SPEAKER_00]: be said that there are some rare plants
out there that will not reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do reverse and make pollen,
their pollen is sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole spectrum out there from
failure just to reverse from it makes male
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, but not actual pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole range of partial
reversals, we call them, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical reversal happens, but what you're
after, active live pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are capable of fertilizing and
creating seed don't actually occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've even had friends that in order to
get 50 or 100 seeds, they had to take all
[SPEAKER_00]: the male flowers and grind them up through
strainers and stuff to try to extract the
[SPEAKER_00]: few grains of pollen that actually
existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my final thoughts on my little
presentation I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make sure I covered
everything, so I made a little
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apologies, it's not a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only know slideshows.
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thoughts are, make sure you're
using a good STS-based product.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one uses colloidal silver anymore,
like I said earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody needs to see it, there's a
paper by Mohan Ram from 1982 comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: them all, and they found that STS was the
supreme for reversing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to think numbers, numbers,
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you win.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you beat the odds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Numbers, numbers, numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray in the nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray in the armpits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch for overspray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a whole room full of herms
and you don't know what the pollen toner
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes less is more when it comes to
how often you spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes spraying once a day is too much
for whatever plants you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move it down to once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And female reverse still have female bud
structure with male parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not hang and often cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really covers the whole how to make
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you want to go into
anything else and do you tell on feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds or if there's anything else you want
to cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the timing thing is pretty
interesting because maybe we could expound
[SPEAKER_00]: upon that for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps, what you're saying basically is
for most people, they would want to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse what they plan on being their male
pollen sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is three to four weeks ahead of when
they actually flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a half to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention to people in
nature, nature has worked out over a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time when males drop pollen versus where
the females are at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you break that when you're doing it
yourself and so you have to pick the right
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another art too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and CSI and others have told me that
you can have a situation where there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some rare plants that you can spray right
at the same time as you bloom everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else because they reverse very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are in that two and a half to
three week range, but it can vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely plenty of stories that
Matt could talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a successful reversal,
but you mess up on your timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a state of flower for the females
that it's formed enough pistols and enough
[SPEAKER_00]: bud that you actually want to pollinate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to make sure you're
introducing pollen at the perfect time for
[SPEAKER_00]: where your buds are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you introduce pollen too early,
let's say you miss the window and it's two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have a few white hairs and they
get hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops producing more white hairs for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, we're pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now our job is to produce the seed and
finish the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the plant's internal memory and
time clock, how it flips.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the seed you're going to end up
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very many seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the flip side, you want to make sure
that when you pollinate, you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest amount of white stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always get that one wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always call them pistols, but I think
it's stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure you have the most
amount of white stigma and the least
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's brown, it can't catch the pollen
and it can't make seeds in its little
[SPEAKER_01]: ovule down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that- Maybe we
should just explain the science for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those white hairs catches a
tiny little pollen grain and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: tube in that white hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen grain then falls down that
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way until it hits where it's
supposed to fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the core beginning of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he's saying is that if those white
hairs are damaged by wind or sprays or
[SPEAKER_00]: this or that, if they're withered,
they won't have the tube to shoot the
[SPEAKER_00]: grain into where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those is a slip and slide,
if you will, for a pollen grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One pollen grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: A single pollen grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone said they were on mushroom,
so I turned up the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those basically are out there just to
catch a pollen grain in the wind and then
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot it down into the actual flower
itself where it can meet and fertilize and
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to grow the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the plant just focuses on seed
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, the plant knows,
okay, I've done my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've flowered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got seed in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the energy goes to that usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less on resin production, less on anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should know too that it tends to
be, not with everything, but it tends to
[SPEAKER_00]: be somewhere around the two and a half to
four weeks in of the female flowering for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to develop enough flower formation that
it has a plethora of white hairs
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere sticking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has enough time left that when
you fertilize, you have enough time,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is usually four to six weeks,
to make ripe seeds before the plant starts
[SPEAKER_00]: getting extremely overdone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud starts rotting and issues start
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you grown seeds, for example,
strain one reversed onto strain two and
[SPEAKER_01]: strain two reversed onto strain one?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do results vary?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of a good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got some bubblegum by Durbin Poison
and Durbin Poison by Bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time, Bubblegum was reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second time, Durbin Poison was reversed or
however it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see the differences in
those, but usually the mother plant tends,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this isn't always, again, it depends,
but generally speaking, the mother plant
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to dominate most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing little slight variances on
the mother line with a little input from
[SPEAKER_01]: the reverse plant, but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that reverse plant can dominate,
co-dominate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of discovery in that
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also goes a little bit to the current
state of seed making, which is most
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders do one-offs and then they move
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: By definition, in order to get what was
just asked, you would have to reverse one
[SPEAKER_00]: female to do one breeding, and then at a
separate time, reverse the other side of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two separate breedings in order to
get the parents flipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a task.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not every time is a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it might be four trials just to
get two things just to flip the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that we talk about fairly
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the parent, male or female,
make a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an influence in that regard?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an area of reversals that
needs a lot more study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just like everything in
cannabis, whether it's male or female.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on how the alleles line
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to line up differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a male onto another genetic line,
or a female, reverse female onto another
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic line, and vice versa, switching
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll always line up differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see things similar between the
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there will be similar
expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are going to be differences,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see some expressions occur
more often in one of those crosses versus
[SPEAKER_01]: the other cross, if that makes sense.

[SPEAKER_01]: There's more people in here than that.

[SPEAKER_01]: I always forget to say that since we're on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can like, share, and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's a lot of feminized
breeding, certainly techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, that needs to be expanded upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as cannabis goes, we might still be
in the child stage of our level of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of room in there for
science, and for experiments to teach us
[SPEAKER_00]: various aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why so many breeders swap stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always extremely curious how the
plants respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they respond to certain ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they respond differently at a
different time, but they were treated the
[SPEAKER_00]: same?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to think that there's probably a
threshold, which varies from strain to
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, on how much silver is needed to
get the correct effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, you're probably overloading
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, it probably needed more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's plant per time, per plant,
per time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be, because you could do the
same strain, the same clone at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, the next time, the same amount,
it's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's per plant, per time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even think methods of reversal can be
played with as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think STS has been settled upon because
it works better than the alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still experimenting and playing
around with different techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with hard to reverse plants
that we really are interested in making
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds, and things that often
fail with STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a different pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt mentioned some other products earlier
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy's a dick to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept pushing his product forever,
as much as mine, but I'm not gonna do that
[SPEAKER_01]: no more, because he's been using me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean in the sense, I wasn't even
talking about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about the, what was the
other product?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other product that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retain, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different methods of reversals
that have barely been experimented with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna find some stuff in the near
future, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a bunch of us pseudo farmers
that are just weird people trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist, and I'm one of the
guys been figuring it out, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure it out some of the longest,
and that's not appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people way better than me and more
qualified to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope in the next few years, we're gonna
learn a lot more as they come this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In agriculture, they can bring in colleges
and universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can bring in ag departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get scientists who are helping
kids work on their PhDs and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: study certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the farmer isn't actually doing
a bunch of wide-scale experimentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I'm learning as I'm talking
to more and more academics, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: interviewing them for our show or trying
to schedule that, or just trying to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to them about genetics in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the people that are working
hands-on in the universities with the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that I've run into the most
is that they really don't think cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: people have anything to offer them as far
as knowledge of history, knowledge of
[SPEAKER_01]: science, knowledge of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really, really don't think that we
have a good handle on what has happened
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are of the opinion that, and when I
say they, this is pretty much everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: that's done any kind of genomics work in
cannabis, be it the big company that did
[SPEAKER_01]: it for a while, the universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are still using the method that
crowdsourcing and getting whoever,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they crowdsource, let's say they
crowdsource Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever they crowdsource and the most
occurs, that is what they use as their
[SPEAKER_01]: legacy clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to explain to scientists how that
does not work for cannabis because the
[SPEAKER_01]: tighter something is held, the more rare
it is, usually the tighter it's held and
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't proliferate the community as
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works in reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to work in reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to be on the ground,
have access to these people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: circles, and they have to trust you before
they're going to tell you stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I'm learning that they think
we're very incapable of getting this done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be one of those bridges that
we have to learn to cross and work with
[SPEAKER_01]: each other on because that's going to bust
some egos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've put in a lot of work to
history stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people tell me that, I'm like,
well, why is it true?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we put in the work, but they don't
see it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be interesting establishing
those boundaries and new relationships in
[SPEAKER_01]: science and working against each other's
egos because it's hard to talk to PhDs
[SPEAKER_01]: when you've been doing something your
whole life and they've been doing it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still think they're going to know
much better than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many cases, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure what to say about
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say this, which is not exactly what
you were talking about, but I have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: on various projects as things have become
more legal and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've crossed paths with conventional ag
guys and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a big fear in our world where we
just thought that, oh man, once the ag
[SPEAKER_00]: people get ahold of it, they're just going
to crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just these little hobbyists and
they're going to push us out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of those ag people think it
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come into it with a big swinging dick
and they're totally confident in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they flail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They realize all of a sudden that many of
the chemicals and many of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays and things that they use in their
conventional agriculture are specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: banned and they've based their career on
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to growing, well,
I get X amount of tonnage of blueberries
[SPEAKER_00]: per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow the same clone and I treat it the
same way and I get X amount of fruit or I
[SPEAKER_00]: get X amount of produce or I get whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This produce has been bred to make my life
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all agriculture is not bred for the
consumer to be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bred for the farmer to produce a lot
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ship it easier and store it longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give a perfect example like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes, their primary goal is weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want it to rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want its skin to crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it to store and travel well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be able to pick it green,
ship it green, then blast it with ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: and ripen it before they put it out on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after all these different factors
come in, then taste and texture and flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the opposite of most of this
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you go into the grocery store
and you buy vegetables, I'm not trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: dis Blue Dream, but I'm just going to say
Blue Dream has enough qualities that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: an obvious commercial cropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your food, for the most part,
is an obvious commercial cropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was developed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Ag gets involved and they're like,
what are you doing growing all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stringy bullshit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean the consumer likes it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We dictate what the consumer even can eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tasteless strawberries give us X
amount more per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor ones, they tend to rot and they
don't give us nearly as much weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't even eat normal tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll only eat cherry now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the whole heirloom thing came
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just went back to when people bred
tomatoes to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste so much better than the ones
that are just made for weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get back to what I'm saying,
I thought with Big Ag, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques they've relied on for most of
their career, they can't rely on in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because it's banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the lifetime of knowledge
of growing that specific crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also can't go to universities or
older guys in the industry and just learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from them about this specific crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Big Ag has been building on the
people that came before them in Big Ag for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades and decades now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has to reinvent the wheel in Big
Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now in science, what I was talking
about was that they really genuinely do
[SPEAKER_01]: not think.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I don't even know that they know that
there is a planned destiny to cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are these guys in these hills
that have these stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people I talked to, they really didn't
think that anybody was really doing a good
[SPEAKER_01]: job of keeping track in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know that anybody was even
trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't care to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I brought up that story
about Big Ag is the same thing that Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: was just talking about with PhDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of assumptions looking
from outside in and they don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: realize the depth and the level that
already exists within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot that they can teach us,
but there's a lot that they have to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I'm coming up against a lot
of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize that there's a lot that I can
learn from them, but I genuinely think
[SPEAKER_01]: that they don't think that there's
anything they could learn from any of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's humbling because it's like,
wow, they really don't take any of us
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's also concerning to me and
I'm really trying to make an effort to
[SPEAKER_01]: make inroads there because these are the
same people that are going to be writing
[SPEAKER_01]: the history books and the textbooks in
universities and colleges that tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't make those inroads and the
person that eventually ultimately is in
[SPEAKER_01]: charge of writing these textbooks,
because there's going to be a few of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: a group of them, if they don't go look at
the real history, they get to write the
[SPEAKER_01]: history and it's lost, except for these
little podcasts here and little bits of
[SPEAKER_01]: notes of history.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all lost anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only real if it's in the textbooks
and history books.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen that happen time and time
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to make these
inroads, but I'm definitely, definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: having a hard time doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really nice people over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the people who don't necessarily
understand the need for us or want to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with any of us are pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if they can just be shown our
culture and understand how it worked since
[SPEAKER_01]: the 60s and 70s, they would have a much
better appreciation for the people who did
[SPEAKER_01]: keep, long before I came around,
keep the history going and keep tabs on
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it'll happen, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always been a sense of there's the
above board of what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and then there's the underground and
there's the black markets and there's all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arrogance about what you don't know is a
common human trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get older and you get humbled by how
much you don't know and by how many things
[SPEAKER_00]: get turned on their head about what you
think you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with them when they're trying
to do the cannabis I don't want to call it
[SPEAKER_00]: genome or whatever, but when they were
doing it for say humans, they could go to
[SPEAKER_00]: pure Scandinavians or pure Aborigines or
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could go and they could test so many
different humans and they could build a
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, they can't really do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people would never get invited to
any inner circle tables anywhere because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're assholes about it and they wear it
on their sleeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before on the podcast,
but I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even right now, that's the problem that
you have with testing is that testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: to my knowledge, testing for potency
doesn't explain what kind of high it gives
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of what people consider 30%
or 35% or something that we all consider
[SPEAKER_00]: to be extremely bland and boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing can't tell you why this high makes
me want to giggle and run around and crawl
[SPEAKER_00]: out of my chair and have a little anxiety
and why this high wants to make me pull up
[SPEAKER_00]: the covers and is warm and comforting and
couch lock and potato chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a new term yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's new to me, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a new term.
[SPEAKER_01]: New to me term called biphasic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was used to describe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Chimera said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the cannabis is biphasic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we've learned through science
that things that are in the 6%,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say he said 12% or somewhere in
there, have a more peppy, jingly type high
[SPEAKER_01]: to most people, generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that are in the upper 20s to
whatever can give you paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then have a quicker descending high,
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's biphasic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Chimera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the point that I was trying to
make is that right now there's all this
[SPEAKER_00]: testing going on and they think they know
what the hell they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even testing for most
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even testing for most
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're testing for the known ones that
are the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's 150 cannabinoids, or something,
and they're testing for 30, or there's
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of terpenes and they're testing
for two dozen, and they don't even really
[SPEAKER_00]: realize how they all blend together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is in its infancy on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is the best tool that we have,
but they only know what they know until
[SPEAKER_00]: they're proven wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember early on when CBD became a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that they were saying that
there's no psychoactive effects or effect
[SPEAKER_01]: on the central nervous system with CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, I didn't think that CBD,
giving someone a large dose of CBD would
[SPEAKER_01]: do anything to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human body is one of the most studied
parts of science, because it's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important things to us, because it's
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What year did that Israeli scientist
discover that we had a cannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: within our body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it 80s?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm going to say 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could look it up, but I'm going to say,
I don't think we discovered we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid system until I was alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even realize that existed,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to even figure it out,
because it was a legal thing to research.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to go through so many hoops to
even do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pointless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing too, is that when
it comes to cannabis and cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: they only allowed study for harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: To prove that it was bad, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these PhDs and stuff like that,
basically it's like they get handed this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that no one has studied extensively
in decades, and they think they understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but they really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they just handed it, and they're
hoping to figure it out, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: smart, and they're used to figuring stuff
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will eventually need people to figure
it out correctly that have been doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time, but whether they're going
to figure that out or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember everybody was telling the
company that begins with the PE that was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all the genetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every consult was telling them,
this is who you need to consult.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to talk to this guy, because he's
really good with X amount of clones in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can get you the legacy cuts at XYZ,
and everything is spelled out for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, all they said was,
no, we're just crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they obviously had a
different goal from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in our lifetime, it's going
to be immensely changing what they
[SPEAKER_00]: discover about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that ... Ah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The existence of cannabinoid receptors in
the brain was discovered in studies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as Kristen said, 88, but they
discovered THC in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was Maluchem, the guy I was
referring to with the Israeli dude that
[SPEAKER_00]: was figuring out- It shows how in the
1960s, they discovered THC and cannabidol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that led to the 1988 discovery of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They discovered it before they knew how it
interacted with our brain, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system is the largest
receptor system and the master regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: of homeostasis in the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even know it existed until 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's not that long ago,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, it's not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only been a number- He was already
40, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been a few decades, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that all interact, or why does it
do what it does?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think PhDs are going to be shocked when
they start delving into it, and they think
[SPEAKER_00]: of something as simple, and it's going to
be like a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was spread by war and conquest and
trade and migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human slavery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's going to be an enormous
amount of interest because it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: tie into all that stuff, which is kind of
far away from feminized seating,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's all part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only other thing I was going
to touch on a little bit, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we've already touched on it pretty well,
in fact, was the Bode thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that was big news this week,
and everybody was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bode working with cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made the announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to say again, that's my boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick with him through
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all don't like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there would have been a
Breeder Syndicate without Bode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have never started any of this
stuff without him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get why people are hesitant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of partnerships have gone
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: In flames over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hope if anybody can do it,
he can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'll say on that is that
the internet is certainly a place where
[SPEAKER_00]: people can pile on, and I do understand
people's feelings because, and I'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: this, Bode has a special place,
in my opinion, in the cannabis world,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that he is pretty well universally
regarded as a great human, a traveler,
[SPEAKER_00]: an explorer, someone who brings back all
kinds of oddball genetics that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: popular at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird sativas and odd things from his
travels, and he preserves them in various
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, and he's just a generally nice
human.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders I know look up to him as
an example of how to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes and joins the Borg.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people, while they wouldn't
harsh on other folks for doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't seem like it fits with Bode's
purest, adventurer, heart, soul,
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'll say to that is that in
a rapidly changing environment where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of change happening fast,
people are trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt, how to survive, how to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I make money ethically?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of people that aren't even
thinking about how to make it ethically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just thinking how to make it,
but how to make it ethically is even
[SPEAKER_00]: harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to be an outsider, rebel,
warrior, who is never going to touch base
[SPEAKER_00]: with anyone that's larger or corporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because large corporate groups and large
players and stuff like that are now,
[SPEAKER_00]: for better or for worse, they are going to
have, not the only hand, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a stake in the cannabis
industry moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, and so how do you interact with
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you try to work with them from the
inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you try to just lob Molotov cocktails
against them and hope they burn and go
away?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my method.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an impact there where you see a
lot of different people trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out, well, how do I move forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, the environment has totally
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market has totally changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sales are in the toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I support myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I support my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I make an impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that there's a lot of debate
going on in the community about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's free to have their opinions
about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: To people that actually know him,
he's still a good-hearted, good person.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the same dude he was the day before
he made that deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still has dozens of lines that probably
no one watching would ever grow because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're weird and they're odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from here and they're from
Cambodia and they're from the Highlands
[SPEAKER_00]: and Nepal and they're ugly as sin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a love of cannabis and he loves his
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just really it, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are upset, all I can say
is if you're upset about it and if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: worried that the mainstream people are
going to start seeing some of Bodhi's
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, there was a time where you could
buy Bodhi seeds and that wasn't happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had that chance to support him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi should have been more successful
than cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, he should have been way
bigger than Compound or any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have that voting privilege with
their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we vote in our cannabis
community is with our money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't like someone we want to have
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't buy their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll go away eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had that chance with Bodhi and that
we've had the chance with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger companies that we're going to watch
slowly go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to get mad at their
decisions for going away and retiring and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all this or just still growing,
not selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we all had the chance to change that
and not enough people gave a care at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, I think in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it like this, because
breeders unfairly mostly, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are regarded as artists in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You watch some of these acceptance
speeches for Oscars or whatever and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of famous actors though admittedly they
took a bunch of crappy jobs for work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hope that they get successful enough
that they can take some chances and make
[SPEAKER_00]: some really cool stuff every once in a
while in between these commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: successful ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a musician or whatever,
but if you're a musician and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive, it really helps if you make a hit
single every now and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Playing punk rock ain't going to make you
rich as I found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a joke, I don't hear a single.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect of commercialism where
sometimes you have to bend a bit in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep doing the cool stuff that you want
to be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be like, oh, this artist should
stay completely pure and not even touch
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalism, but we live in a capitalistic
society and people are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: weighing who to work with, how to work
with them, what's ethical, what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I change them from the inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I improve things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I move it in my direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that goes with a lot of art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have taken the chances Bodhi
did with that particular group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I admit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have done it, but I'm very
pessimistic about everyone and certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's a reason he's the one that
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's a reason he was there and
he's the one that got that chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's much more open to people not all
being snakes and seeing the good in people
[SPEAKER_01]: than someone like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's always telling me, oh, you should
have expected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, oh, dude, you're good Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Matt, I'm not even saying I defend
the partnership necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly defend the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is capable of making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a mistake or not will only be
known in time because Cookie has a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of clout.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we widen the gene pool, who do you want
them to work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Junkie?
[SPEAKER_00]: They already did that.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the people they're already
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you want somebody with the power
and reach of Cookie to work with someone
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and bring better things and try to
have some better earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me, I wish all of us artists out
there were independently wealthy and were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to make every decision based on a
strict series of ethics and a punk rock
[SPEAKER_00]: ethos of fuck the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys see my company over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work as a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just buck everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a totally random story that I
always think I talk about with Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: because punk is his world, not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember watching this interview with
the lead singer and guitarist of Suicidal
[SPEAKER_00]: Tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking about how in punk rock,
they basically at some point want you in
[SPEAKER_00]: your 40s to be homeless, dead broke,
addicted to heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your equipment doesn't work and you
commit suicide via a bomb on stage and you
[SPEAKER_00]: go out just like a raging inferno to the
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you get a little older and he's
like, you want a guitar tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to sleep in a decent
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids that you made, you want to
actually be able to feed them and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: send them to college, even though you're
punk as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to strap a bomb to my chest
and die at 45 on stage, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking, screaming, howling homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's like, that's what the fans expect
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that push pull between art
and commercialism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where on the line do you fall?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, in order to make cool art,
you have to deal with commercialism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got lucky for a time in that when 215
came, cannabis for a while was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable and the risk was lowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allowed this amazing burst of
creativity and energy where a lot of small
[SPEAKER_00]: time farmers could take their heart's
desire and do whatever they wanted with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we grew it to the point where it got
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went from underground to not
underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then big money starts coming in and rich
kids and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of a sudden, the scene's all
twacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they give us hemp and all the hemp
fields start growing, weeding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody gets greedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got too much weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's got weed jobs and there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of weed has gone way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality in dispensaries is way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he wants to survive, everyone's looking
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I survive to be able to do more
things that I like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone out there is going to have to
make their own generalized opinion about
[SPEAKER_00]: which steps are acceptable and which steps
aren't, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all within everyone's purview.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was surprising to see the outpouring of
anger because I just don't think that they
[SPEAKER_00]: expected it to see it from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shocked because this was announced
four or five months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't super shocked, to be honest,
because when it was announced,
[SPEAKER_00]: Berner had to turn comments off and he
deleted the post.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a big outpouring of rage and
then it quieted down for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's getting released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's getting released with this CD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community is split in a lot of ways
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fracturing of the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of new people jumping in the
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of change happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very intense for people our age that
have been in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been one consistent way for some
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first real cannabis recession
I think we've ever seen in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just our age, but any age this severe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a small subculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to be a ginormous industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that comes changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody like Berner couldn't exist 20
years ago because he's scared out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about scared out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like there was no marketing of
self.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Famous people got arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't able to market yourself that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just been a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think change will continue to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing is that the people you
like need to figure out a way to survive
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can keep making cool shit.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we've hit already the hour
and a half mark and we started talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about maybe shortening the time a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick, we are starting to do
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday I put up a strain review for one
of Santa Cruz Goat Farm strains from PACS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to be doing all kinds
of cool content like small things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natza is going to do smaller little talks
too and try to get more stuff going for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're getting approved for the
YouTube membership stuff, so we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to incorporate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our super chats available now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone gave us our first super chat
earlier, so that was super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know if it worked or not,
so it was cool to see it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate it from the bottom of
our heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out RiotSeeds.com for all your
seeds and spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natzodog, you got anything coming up you
want to talk about or anything cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe before next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be quiet this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it sounds good then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to bring up the stuff real quick
because I got to have the exit song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to do this right, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to put up the thing, the background
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to take this off and see you next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you then.
See you then.
