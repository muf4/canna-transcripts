[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_02]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_02]: Not-so-dog, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first things, I think since we
have you here, Shawnee, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the things that we're often talking
about, like, when we're in Discord and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff is hype strains, people,
admiration, different things people
[SPEAKER_02]: experience as, like, as they're just
getting back into buying seeds and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into the scene or, in your case,
getting back into it from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: being into it real heavy at one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the biggest things that people
come to you with is why you hate root beer
[SPEAKER_02]: so much?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your problem with gene?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this root beer hate you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've always seen it from
your angle, but I would like you to
[SPEAKER_02]: explain it from your angle for everyone to
hear, because when I hear it, I don't hear
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I don't hear what they're
hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of imagine what they're
hearing, but I don't know what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's something kind of like viral in
our server.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think because there was a lot of
arguments around it as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, so yeah, so like, I entered the
computer world with IG and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you don't know when you don't
know people, you don't know all these like
[SPEAKER_01]: brands and you don't know all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't have any idea what you're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I started to like, well,
hanging out with you guys, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: question what I'm buying, trying to
understand on a deeper level, all this
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, there's certain things that are
like super, super big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, why are they big?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why does everybody want this?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I ask those questions to other
people, it's like, I don't get an answer
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And root beer was like the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that was the one that
stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, everybody wanted root beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't I didn't really understand
why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think anybody else really did
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it was because like it was
just how you asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why root beer?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think someone took that as an
offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was so offensive that you would
even ask why.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 30 of us talking about how much we
want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Gene's cool and all this stuff and
like everything verified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, what's the
problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's nobody really experienced
it like very few people ever experienced
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody really has any idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't really proven on any level that
we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just kind of like blew up because
of the means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like there was that podcast episode
where Gene was talking about it and he
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed really open about it and he that he
didn't want to release it because he
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't think it would live up to the
expectation that had already built up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, he mentioned like herm
issues of people were running it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people still wanted it like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like I don't think people
even listen to him in that section,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what I heard was, you know,
maybe it's not as good as everyone thinks.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're just being realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting people realistic expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I like I've tried to tell
people when they were arguing with you,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's an I don't think it is even
necessarily about root beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it certainly isn't about just gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you don't even have a
problem with gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a nice dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more about the idea of why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is there hype behind this and why are
we feeling like sheep?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the cult?
[SPEAKER_01]: The phenomenon of it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it just like it's this hive mind
mentality where, you know, certain things
[SPEAKER_01]: get mentioned enough that everyone's like,
damn, I want to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but like what I want more people
to be doing is to is to like understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what they like, what they what they want
and if it's something that they want,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like I I haven't run any of gene
stuff, but mainly because he from my
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding, he breeds outdoors in a
region that is far from me and I grow
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't it doesn't make sense for
me to run his seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like there's other things I
would rather do not not because of any
[SPEAKER_01]: anything against him or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I've sort of ruled certain
certain things out due to things like I
[SPEAKER_01]: just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's outdoor seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that's something I wish I
not even just you or and again,
[SPEAKER_02]: not even in relation to gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone should be taking that into what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, OK, I'm growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to have seeds that were bred
indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these breeders breeding my seeds
indoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they're bringing them outdoor
and you're trying to bring them indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of stuff that does really well
outdoor will have intersex traits indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's common.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something people should be
asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't even think anybody even asked
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't even think that was that's
not even a part of the equation when
[SPEAKER_02]: people think about buying seeds like,
oh, it's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it often isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It often isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like that, like from my experience,
like the average person, they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at all the wrong things usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're looking at like a name
that sticks out that either they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: attachment to or whatever the reason or a
certain like profile that it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be promising you or, you know,
like very surface level things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it interesting actually,
too, like in our server, watching a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people pop some things that, you know,
are probably going to be like a high
[SPEAKER_01]: potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're like, whoa, this is a
little much, you know, like maybe they got
[SPEAKER_01]: hit with that for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just like, yeah, it's it's
definitely potent, but it might not be
[SPEAKER_01]: what I want to smoke every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I think that's really great
growth for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I love that's what I love about
popping seed and trying new things is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, it's all about what you
like and experiencing that and then trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to search for the things that,
you know, do it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, pack?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have local botanist here with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of just joy jumped into the
conversation and we're recording it a
[SPEAKER_02]: little late on Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just going to have a small
roundtable to talk about some different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we are going to talk a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of leads into a little bit
of what I was going to get into about like
[SPEAKER_02]: putting people on pedestals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I think that is a another
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we see it and it happens here,
you know, like just being totally
[SPEAKER_02]: transparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it happen here with me, with not so
we try to keep it as as real as possible
[SPEAKER_02]: and remind people we're just fucking like
low rent farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I grow a few types of plants,
but I'm I'm not even capable of being
[SPEAKER_02]: called a real farmer, let alone needing a
pedestal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and other people don't
necessarily deserve that either.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the world of marketing and hype,
you know, dudes flashing Rolexes or fake
[SPEAKER_02]: Rolexes, that doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it looks by real fast, you know,
pedestals happen a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and one thing I've noticed is what
happens when people have their their
[SPEAKER_02]: paradigm shifted on a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's say that this is their hero
breeder and they find out something very
[SPEAKER_02]: devastating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost it almost breaks people
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have seen it like people flip the
fuck out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really weird with like grown adult
men, you know, yeah, it is that they're so
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate to that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I'm not a sports fan,
but I also get that vibe when people are
[SPEAKER_01]: like super into like sports dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're a grown up, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the attachment people get to other
grown men like that and admiration that
[SPEAKER_02]: they hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get I get it like because I had that
like it's it's not like something I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got in the scene, like I
remember looking up to Adam Dunn,
[SPEAKER_02]: like he was one of the Americans that went
over there to Amsterdam, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and like Don Aaron were over there,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were kind of like Hollywood
knobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't I didn't like have any kind of
anything vibe with them, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Adam seemed to be smart and like he
would talk about his strings and sourcing
[SPEAKER_02]: these these old California and an American
quote on the string.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was real into him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over time, when you get to meet
people and have relationships with them
[SPEAKER_02]: and they become much more human,
you realize how much you did have them on
[SPEAKER_02]: a pedestal at a time when people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very often you're disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people are as special as you
kind of always hope they would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's that's a rare occurrence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local, when you first got into seeds,
what were some of the dudes that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing about that maybe maybe got you
excited at first and later you you found
[SPEAKER_02]: like maybe maybe I'm not so into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So seeds were really weird for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I bought like from Nirvana
here and there like Dutch Passion was
[SPEAKER_03]: another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like this was already like,
you know, like, I don't know, 2015,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like by then it's like nobody was
really looking into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had a friend who was generous
enough just to give me like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: different seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think one of them was like
something called Blackberry Cheesecake,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a heavy duty fruity cross,
you know, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for the time for me,
I thought they were good because like they
[SPEAKER_03]: smelled different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it wasn't just like a cheap ass bag
you buy on the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, after that,
I I kind of just started like thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about, you know, like, how do people claim
that they are making these crosses that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, for example, like Blue
Dream, you have 20 different fucking blue
[SPEAKER_03]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, a little bit about me,
like my background is in like genetics and
[SPEAKER_03]: botany and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, more so population
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to college for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your university.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I went.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got my degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years ago in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, like instinctually,
I kind of just thought, OK, like these
[SPEAKER_03]: people say they have like, you know,
this blue dream or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, what's to say that
they're all going to be the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have different pollen
donors, you have different like pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: receivers and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like who's to say what's what.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's kind of like what
struck like the whole like provenance type
[SPEAKER_03]: of like, you know, understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It like knowing that like not anyone is
just going to give you what they say it
[SPEAKER_03]: is, you know, because it the sad truth of
it is, is like it's a it's a sketchy
[SPEAKER_03]: scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there are sketchy people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as a little time went on,
like I began to get a little interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of like when I stumbled
upon this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I listened to the first episode and
like I believe he gave Crybaby a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just a little after that,
I joined Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, I mean, it kind of went
from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, luckily, in the middle knee
hole.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, I was like adopted into like a
good community relatively early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I didn't have to go through like
any bullshit or anything or like get my
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking hopes and dreams crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of these other people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know at the end of it, like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you see these dogs, they're almost
in a daze when they hear about like heroes
[SPEAKER_02]: being tweakers, snitches and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the crazy thing is, it's like it's,
you know, we're all humans and it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we should all be true to
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you know, by claiming all
these things, you're like lying to
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what good is that, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of delusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of sad, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's cool about the server here is
like, like, I remember when I was early on
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like everybody has bought shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody's been taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's not like there's people in
there that are very experienced that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like never had that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's where it's like some
people take it super personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are super invested
financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And emotionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I mean, when the when open
conversations happen and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, like this is kind of what we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the greatest thing to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's I don't understand when
people just don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to accept it or they start
fights over it or, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, holy shit, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me more, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't like being wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So help me be right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's get me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, understanding is the most important
part, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about who's good and who's bad
and who's this and who, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just understanding situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, humanizing people like
like nobody's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there isn't a person in the
world that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a person in the world that
hasn't done a stupid thing or misstep or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like people that are actively like
learning and trying to move forward,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like they're moving forward,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the biggest problems that
I found since local you're like a a
[SPEAKER_02]: university type dude was like,
I'm still having trouble communicating
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: University people on the level of like
their geneticists, their botanists,
[SPEAKER_02]: they understand breeding it in these deep
levels, but trying to communicate to them
[SPEAKER_02]: the history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we came to the conclusions that we
have, why we're there and why it matters
[SPEAKER_02]: to what they're doing and why they need to
know this stuff before they start like
[SPEAKER_02]: doing these tests on these strains and
comparing the strain to the strain and why
[SPEAKER_02]: they need to know all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do we how do you tell people
that are obviously much more educated and
[SPEAKER_02]: smart, you know, in their own mind than we
are?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you how do you explain that to
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you do from Europe?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a question, but I mean,
yeah, it is a complex question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I after all,
like I just got my undergrad, like I'm no
[SPEAKER_03]: PhD or like masters by like any means.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, there's definitely intentions
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I don't know, I think it's
really hard for them to kind of accept us
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's because, you know,
we're just a bunch of dudes that like
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke weed and nerd out about,
you know, shit that doesn't really matter
[SPEAKER_03]: to the world, even though it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like one thing I kind of joked
about, like with people, like when they
[SPEAKER_03]: ask like, oh, hey, what do you do as a
botanist?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, yeah, like I study
this, you know, it, you know, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: matter in the grand scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I must say, fuck it and do it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think like one way to maybe get like
attention of some scientists is maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to like integrate some of like
maybe the hypotheses that like we have
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe about certain families of plants,
you know, or groups of plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like how can we integrate this
into like how they're studying,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what they're studying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, for example, the professor that I
was studying under at my school,
[SPEAKER_03]: she was interested in plant breeding
systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know how like weed is fucking
dioecious, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have your male and your
female plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, she was studying plants
that were gyno dioecious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which are female and like, you know,
hermaphroditic plants and they're true
[SPEAKER_03]: males.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, you know, I think there are
ways to kind of integrate like studies
[SPEAKER_03]: between like the two topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, I think it's more about
relating it to their topic of study than,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, trying to achieve this goal,
you know, maybe just sequencing DNA or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever to see what's related.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, like, it's like I look at them and
what they're doing and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how can you even waste your time
sequencing the DNA?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of this blue dream cut that you went and
sourced from a collective that you say 95%
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cuts are similar to this one,
when it's probably not even fucking blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you wasting your time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's not even having anything to
do that everybody in history is talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about and that you're going to be
comparing this data to, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that I can't explain it to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to also consider that we need to
have information on what the parents
[SPEAKER_03]: actually were.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like you can just take what what
was it like a fucking super silver haze
[SPEAKER_03]: and a blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can't just sequence those two
separately and expect it exactly to be
[SPEAKER_03]: related to the blue dream that they
sequenced.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's obviously there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even understand that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems to me, it's so scientifically
obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're going to start at a place,
you're going to fucking crawl back up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the parent line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you should figure this shit out
along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like their ideas were like,
basically, we don't think or the most
[SPEAKER_02]: common sentiment I'm getting from them,
I shouldn't say all of them, the most
[SPEAKER_02]: common sentiment I've gotten from multiple
people in that field is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know you're right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's the beauty of science,
you know, like, yeah, and that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to work on, like
interpreting or not interpreting,
[SPEAKER_02]: using the Bayes theorem to bring in to
actually working that into how we approach
[SPEAKER_02]: history and how we improve past historical
events within reason and within science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like that's something that
I've been looking at as it's used in other
[SPEAKER_02]: like in ancient religions and stuff to
prove what happened in ancient religions,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though all we have is texts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really the key, honestly,
like, you know, people who witness certain
[SPEAKER_03]: events, you know, like primary sources and
all that, you know, like primary sources
[SPEAKER_03]: are, I mean, sometimes going to be some of
the most valuable sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, obviously, those may be
biased depending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as you've seen, dude,
like we've seen firsthand, like the best
[SPEAKER_02]: primary sources and then it gets kind of
screwy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, I feel I feel awesome
knowing that there's actually like this
[SPEAKER_02]: theorem that people have figured out that
helps prove history when it's based on
[SPEAKER_02]: written evidence in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: For reference, it was Dr. Richard Carrier
in one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure I give him credit for
this, because it is a pretty it was
[SPEAKER_02]: proving history and on the proving
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard Carrier proving history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the science world is like the type of
world that like if it's not on paper,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's probably not going to be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's another thing to take
into consideration, you know, I suppose my
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, why do these tests?
[SPEAKER_02]: If none of that matters, why even do the
tests?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, you know, at that point,
it's fucking with ethics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, if this is really something
that they wanted to, per se, integrate
[SPEAKER_03]: into like pharmaceuticals and stuff,
it's like you're also fucking with that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to make it medicine,
then you need the data that people use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you need to go access that data
that people had, you need to know what
[SPEAKER_02]: they were smoking at the time,
not what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that but it just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long, long drawn out process
trying to have these conversations with
[SPEAKER_02]: these university professors and PhDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still gotten to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's gotten not very far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd hope things would get better
with federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just feel like it's still going to
be rather tricky to conduct any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like ecological based studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's going to take I feel like
it's going to take someone as that just
[SPEAKER_02]: happens to get into the head of one of
these programs to end up being a massive
[SPEAKER_02]: seed nerd.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like it's that's someone with a
massive seed nerd and actually gain
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting history and really dive in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like a dice roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because look at how few of us there are in
cannabis, let alone a tiny community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on it, pack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you caught me off guard here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just talking about the the trying to
talk to the university people about why,
[SPEAKER_02]: why they need to take the history of
strange seriously before they start trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to fuck with sequencing and doing all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chasing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a real hard time communicating
with them on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know, I'm not sure if it's lost
in translation, possibly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not having the same kind of reference
point to be able to speak their language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe it's something along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would imagine anybody who's truly,
you know, stepping up to the plate from a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific practitioner level,
they're going to want to consider,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all variables, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just the fact that it's
been taboo to research, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder, you know, people have kind of
become my optic or sort of conditioned
[SPEAKER_00]: into their own as much as scientists are
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also, you know, looking along
their own agenda for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how you how you kind of introduce
another lens to look there is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these people even smoke,
which is like, OK, so you've been smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one of those stone thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not smoking the right shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things I also wanted to get
into was one of the number one questions
[SPEAKER_02]: we get asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have, you know, we have me and pack
on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have Shani and local was males.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have questions about males all the
time, Shani or load up, load up some male
[SPEAKER_02]: questions like that you think people would
want to know about local, you load them
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like, like, number one, right,
like the like, if you're looking for a
[SPEAKER_01]: male and like to use a male, the only way
you know is if you grow the offspring and
[SPEAKER_01]: observe the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, like this, I read this article
and like me and Crybaby had a little
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like what the first question that
popped into my head was like, how many how
[SPEAKER_01]: many elite males exist today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how many people are holding males
that they breed with that they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: like held on to for a significant amount
of time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer was pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that there's a lot of
revisiting with certain males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people, when they do it,
they tend to select another male from the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when we were keeping males alive
over the years before the moon situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would it's just constant repotting,
making sure the pots big enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure your male isn't flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bedroom is constantly 24 seven,
like just 24 on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's never any kind of darkness in my
bedroom because of males constantly trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep males around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, they hit the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd always start flowering in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's in the same location as a
female room, that could be a serious
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're trying to keep males alive
while also making seeds of something else
[SPEAKER_02]: with another male.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not really that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you always have to learn on the fly
over time when it comes to stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really isolating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still not advised to keep them in the same
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's why you don't see it very
often.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like the haze, haze a haze email
that were real famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept the blue bonnet one alive for a
long time and it was over at Radio Ridge
[SPEAKER_02]: until we got HPLV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to keep it alive to pass out for
other people to do blueberry work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the intent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not that common.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the first question I get the
most is what do you look for when
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting a male?
[SPEAKER_02]: The number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like they're pretty much all myths,
though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not myths, but like they're not all
like 100 percent confirmed sort of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is like if you OK, like back in
the day, I remember when I started,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told by by by the hot spread guy,
if you want to find a male, you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: look for the one that looks most like the
female and grows most like a female and
[SPEAKER_02]: the one you think is least like a male in
the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it looks like a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the very last minute, you realize,
oh, it's a male and that's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a long time, I just did that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I started going, I was like,
I'm not really getting anything anywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: by doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not doing anything special for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I didn't know if I was trying to just
make sure there was no herms at the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what I'm trying to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that seems to be what people
complain about the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't want herms, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you're doing this stuff,
you're seeing different traits pop out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you see certain things from from
the male and certain leaf shapes,
[SPEAKER_02]: certain certain serrations like,
oh, wait, the trait I can identify,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and slowly you kind of realize
there's not just one male, one trait,
[SPEAKER_02]: one one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like trying to constantly fit a
square peg in a circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if you if you're looking
for the same trait in every male,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to fit a square peg in a
circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if when it came to the blue bonnet
stuff, it was like I wanted blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: versions of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want that, I'm not going to go to a
to I don't know, apple mints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And try to make that male work,
you know, and just until it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, when you're selecting
for a male, you've got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's as easy as one,
two, three, roll a dice, pick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know anything about the line,
it's a lot easier to know a line,
[SPEAKER_02]: grow the line out, know the females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way, when you start seeing these
males pop out, you can see their
[SPEAKER_02]: counterparts in the female slowly,
but surely with what traits line up with
[SPEAKER_02]: both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's the best advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know your line before you work it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know your line before your line before you
choose a male and it'll tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to have any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think your intentions,
you know, say a lot to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're somebody who's really
trying to go deep and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got the means space wise, time wise
and what have you to go that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: then sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but let's say you just grab a
bag of seeds and you pop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a couple of males and you know,
you're not a lifer necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you want to mess around or even like
open pollination situations, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can open pollinate with more than one
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have 12 males in there
if you have a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like all kinds of consideration in
terms of what you're trying to get into as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's what you're trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to make seeds for sale?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to make it just to learn
the line?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's all kinds of different
reasons and appropriate uses of things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you may not have an opportunity to
go through five males and grow out all
[SPEAKER_00]: their prodigy and continue to select and
figure out how to, you know, dial it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you want.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, local?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have any questions on males?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the question is like, how is one
maybe able to distinguish when to,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say, pull a male from it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the original F1 versus maybe
pulling a male for breeding later down in
[SPEAKER_03]: the generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are there instances like where
people actually like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: move a line forward to select a male or
like, it just seems really odd.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I can't think of a situation unless I
was like doing like parallel breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: where I'm working to two different
expressions from the same line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would choose a male at like F5 to
cross to a male like F5.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good case for doing something
like that, like going down to the male up
[SPEAKER_02]: here as opposed to down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really think of any situation
where I would purposely choose like an F3
[SPEAKER_02]: male over an F1 male for any situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there are occasions where that
comes up, but I can't think of one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, I guess maybe the only
instance I could think of is maybe pulling
[SPEAKER_03]: like a male from an F2 because it is your,
you know, largest window for selection,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and maybe... To just bring more
diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, yeah, the thing is usually if I'm
working something in my mind, if I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: working something forward, I'm only going
forward for uniformity of a trait,
[SPEAKER_02]: never for diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure like if someone had like 10
seeds of a line, that might actually be a
[SPEAKER_02]: decent thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with me, when it comes to open
pollinations, like I'm all or nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open pollinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I have to leave all the males
in there with all the females or one male,
[SPEAKER_02]: one female or one male, all females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's only because like, I feel like
if you're doing any kind of pulling out
[SPEAKER_02]: based on like, oh, this thing's herming,
let's all remove that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm artificially selecting just one little
thing away from that pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only one little thing, but I'm taking
away a trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's not a great trait,
but I'm taking it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it might be a link trait to something
very special in that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might have just pulled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the only time I would say like,
it's more beneficial to have all the males
[SPEAKER_02]: versus just choosing a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's a space consideration like Pac
was talking about, that's an excellent
[SPEAKER_02]: time when it's like, you know,
like you're not probably not even making
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds to sell at that point, but you're
trying to go through the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a perfect time to, you know,
use what works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whatever is going to help you
get through that line more to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect case for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, most people nowadays,
dude, are in it for themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea of like it being,
you know, a lifestyle versus like a window
[SPEAKER_00]: of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to jump through, you know what
I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of separates the men from the
boys, I guess, like the ones who.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it always has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when somebody gets the opportunity to
fuck you over to try and make the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation better, it happened all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's unfortunate because it ruins
friendships, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the difference between the long
timers and the short timers in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like being in being in the seed
scene for over 15 years now, I've watched
[SPEAKER_02]: a revolving door of characters,
some of them the most popular dudes you
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest top of the scene, totally
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one even remembers them anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it flashes in the pan like that
happened all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a high turnover rate in cannabis
and very few are people that have been in
[SPEAKER_02]: it longer than 10 years in the seed scene
that have lasted that long and that are
[SPEAKER_02]: still going through researching,
trying to find the truth, doing all that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard thing to stick with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't make friends trying to find
history and, you know, if you're doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing it like you do,
you know, it's for the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more to it than, you know,
just trying to get some clout,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no, there's zero clout to be
found at the end of digging up history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise people there's a lot of like
enemies to be made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got our 420 sale coming up.
