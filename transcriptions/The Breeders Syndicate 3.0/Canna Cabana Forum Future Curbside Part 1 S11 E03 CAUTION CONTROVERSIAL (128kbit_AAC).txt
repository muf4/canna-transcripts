[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_05]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_05]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_05]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_05]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_05]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to take a quick moment
before we enter into this awesome,
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome episode with more members from the
Kana Kana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let you know our Blue Revolution is in
stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Blueberry Incross that we've been
working on for five years now has finally
[SPEAKER_05]: added what I feel is a great completion
point for it, a true breeding line for
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry scents and flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was our most popular selling line on
the original release when we released the
[SPEAKER_05]: first Bluebonnet crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't make a whole lot of them because
I really wanted to explore what was in
[SPEAKER_05]: them before I did a major release.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were at that point, and it was
originally a DJ Short Blueberry from DJ
[SPEAKER_05]: Short's early, early work where he would
sell the seeds at different talks that he
[SPEAKER_05]: would do across California.
[SPEAKER_05]: I collect his buddy resin lung,
picked up some packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave them to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through them and found the best
representative of what I thought the most
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful blueberry was like, but it
didn't have the exact scent that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I saw that in my mind's eye,
as I would look at it, I would picture
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful blueberry jam, turps,
and flavor, and scent, just all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We made a mission the last five years to
make this a reality and something where
[SPEAKER_05]: you could pop a pack of seeds and it would
be almost identical for that turf profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are now released on riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pre-order is over.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're already shipping out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have something called the Modern
Blue that we didn't really release.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it on our Patreon, so definitely
check that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our 50 tier Patreon ended up getting the
lion's share of these with their monthly
[SPEAKER_05]: package.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Mac Daddy across to Blueberry
Incross Mac Daddy from a company called
[SPEAKER_05]: Outhouse Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then my personal favorite out of the hype
strains, as it were, that we are merging
[SPEAKER_05]: with some of this blue stuff so that we
could bring it into the modern generation
[SPEAKER_05]: and get some of the new kids interested,
the Sherb Cream Pie, phenomenally
[SPEAKER_05]: resinous, great hash maker, great
yielding, nice long high for a sherb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blueberry Incross, which is my biggest
promisher, crossed to our Blueberry
[SPEAKER_05]: Incross, and we call that one Blue Cocky,
and yeah, triple entendre there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Blue Sphemi, because it's blast
for me to use something like Runts for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The white Runts, out of all the Runts
stuff I found to be the best Runts cross
[SPEAKER_05]: with the most potent high.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a Blueberry Incross cross to that,
bringing heavy, heavy blueberry jam turps
[SPEAKER_05]: to the white Runts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have Tropberry, which is the Dosey
Trop, Trop Cherry, I believe, crossed to
[SPEAKER_05]: the Dosey Dose, crossed to the Blueberry
Incross.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these are currently available on
our site.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they're sold out, they're sold out,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to make sure you're all aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, without any further ado, let's get
into our show and welcome Curbside and
[SPEAKER_05]: some of his homies from the Cabana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Matthew, and today I'm here not with
my co-host.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's busy doing work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So today, I'm going to be the one hosting
it, and we have some of the other crew
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Canna Cabana.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Okie, we got Chris Vaus,
is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kirby, the man behind the new version
of Canna Cabana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today we're going to talk with each
one of these guys about how they got into
[SPEAKER_05]: everything, what their specialties are,
what they've done with it, the different
[SPEAKER_05]: areas they've traveled, and not only that,
but the future for the Canna Cabana,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we really want to instill from the
Breeders Syndicate side how important
[SPEAKER_05]: forum culture was and is and will always
be to keeping everything correct,
[SPEAKER_05]: straight, and keeping that part of the
culture alive, because that has been a
[SPEAKER_05]: major part of the culture for all of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, Okie, you want to start?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about yourself, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you get started?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got started in the weed biz by
pretty much not having any access to good
[SPEAKER_03]: weed in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was tired of kind of the Mexican brick
that I was used to getting, and I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: figured, hey, I might be able to grow
better than this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, that's where I got started
back in 2002 in Oklahoma, in my closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, we moved to Denver,
which is where all of us met and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: gradually scaled things up over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did you get your seeds from early on
when you are your first genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I think it was, do you remember?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Heaven's Gateway or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some of the first seeds I ever grew
where I'm pretty sure it was Brother's
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand MC 99.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was a G 13 hash plant cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was a shitty grower at the time,
so it wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it was a nice place to
start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like a different look from
the Mexican brick weed, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up on the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was a definite Mexican brick weed
smoker, you know, growing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciated it for what it was until
I found real dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really quickly realized there's a
whole this is a whole nother level of
[SPEAKER_05]: weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us some of your early beginnings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I grew up in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much similar story to Okie,
you know, started growing in my closet
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was in college, started smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like maybe 12 or 13, kind of on the
regular by late high school, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in college, I actually found myself
like, you know, I went to a big Florida
[SPEAKER_02]: college, like everyone party in,
and I couldn't like hang and drink,
[SPEAKER_02]: like bothered my stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I soon figured out that like cannabis
was my social in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my way to talk to girls and my way
to hang out with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, because I couldn't hang on
like pounding beers night after night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of just became my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started selling weed, I started growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I met some good people
early on that got to put me on got,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, guys that had a bunch of grow
houses going and just put me to work as
[SPEAKER_02]: like a grind, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we just had the old speed
trays with the Rockwell slabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like early, early mid
2000s, you know, similar timeline,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2003, 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, had a couple spots and
eventually got my own little spot going
[SPEAKER_02]: cranking out and and then we all got
raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ended up laying low for a couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I spent a lot of time in
Amsterdam, going to Europe a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and then went to California
in 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in Oakland, ended up getting like
robbed and just everything fell apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like an Oakland story,
you know, since 2009 when things were just
[SPEAKER_06]: opening up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a cousin in Denver and I was
like, you know, Colorado is not that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, legalizing like Cali is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just went there and like kind of
started life over in his basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he let me kind of run his grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, within less than a year of
being in Colorado, I had an investor,
[SPEAKER_02]: a warehouse, a spot, you know,
it's kind of just just in there meeting
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what were some of the early strains you
saw when you were first barely starting to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys that I got put on with just were
growing this hash plant, this Florida hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that, you know, I've heard the guys
from Swamp Boys, a couple of people that
[SPEAKER_02]: were in that scene and that they talk
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people said it came from
the Sensi Seeds hash plant from Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_02]: but nobody was really sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say it may have been the white
before we called it that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it had that, you know,
squatty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was real hashy smelling, like that
myrcine kind of really cut through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, it was just about pumping that
one plant out and it was super dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like like I never saw anything
like that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody got busted and this didn't
make it, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida had some dank, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or had all kinds of dank over there
running around in different little
[SPEAKER_05]: circles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a big indoor scene up until
2006 when the, you know, there was federal
[SPEAKER_02]: funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like get everybody busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they said there was more indoor in
Florida than in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They held down like, you know,
the Triangle Kush, the white, like you
[SPEAKER_05]: said, the Gainesville green.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all kinds of stuff that came out
of there that was just absolute fire and
[SPEAKER_05]: changed the world of cannabis as far as I
see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, Kirby, curbside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably like mid to late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swag weed that I was stealing from my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so and he he didn't have the
highest standards for himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it wasn't very good for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but then I had a buddy, a real good
friend of mine who had went to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: and came back with some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe they were some Neville's Northern
Lights, number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew that and we smoked that for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it Clee's brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of like he was the first
dude of our of my friends that was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, had, you know, did it from seed out
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had another buddy, another buddy who
was a big smoker, who had a hippie friend
[SPEAKER_00]: who always had like the fire, like the
best weed that we had seen at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had some strawberry cough one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Yuck Mouth from the Looney's
was in town and we got this ounce that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to go sell to Yuck Mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the best weed we had ever
seen, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all just like, oh, we shouldn't
even sell this to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he takes one look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, this is some fruity shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all just like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like crying over here trying to
figure out how we can get this weed back
[SPEAKER_00]: from him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so we just started smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, you know, I started learning how
to grow a little bit of weed from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always, you know, hustling some weed
on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early on, my favorite, I mean,
back in the day when I think of like early
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s weed and still I've talked about it
several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite weed, all time cat piss would
stain your pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would, you know, you'd be smoking
something different three weeks later and
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin in your pipe would still taste
like cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so pungent.
[SPEAKER_04]: What area of the country were you living
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Denver, Aurora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you born and raised there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Born and raised in Aurora, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when Chris kind of moved out,
there was probably around 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after he got out there,
we linked up online somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even tell you specifically how it
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up working with Chris in his first
warehouse that he even had up there in
[SPEAKER_00]: Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was behind a strip club called the Bus
Stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was always some entertainment
provided and standing out smoking your
[SPEAKER_00]: joint outside of work, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, then just, you know, Chris,
he's so good at networking and meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: people and he travels around all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so many people that I've met and
become friends with or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: mutual acquaintances.
[SPEAKER_00]: With is from Chris traveling around
meeting everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the best introductions that you
could make, you know, back in the day in
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed game was like, oh, I'm such and
such from the cabana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was almost like, you know,
the locks and the doors just opened up and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like you were almost already kind
of verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you already had the cabana stamp of
approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people were more open to
meeting you and, you know, talking to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and working with you and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it started early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember, you know, I think me and you
first met.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember who it was through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Phil, Phil Rojo.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I remember we first met at a strip
club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shotgun Willie's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every 420 back in the day, Canorado would
throw a big event at Shotgun Willie's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some kind of loose connection to
Shotgun Willie's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just a few loose connections there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere they allow all of us to go in
there and run rampant for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there were a couple of really
good years where we had a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the stacks of two dollars
bills, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stacks of twos from Kirby.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were there for the two dollar bill
year, you were there for a good year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you remember this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Joe Schmo decided we were going to
start smoking inside Shotgun Willie's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cops fucking pushed us all the way
into the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're kind of surrounding us slowly
but surely because they weren't quite sure
[SPEAKER_05]: if we're going to fucking fight and what
we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden, like a hooker backed
back to her Lamborghini up over a cop car.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they all bailed out the front.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were able to fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scurry on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just crazy because like events
like that, man, just the six degrees of
[SPEAKER_00]: separation that so many of us have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kevin Bacon theory or however it
works?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we and out in Colorado, man,
it was cool because there were several.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have a special guest for us later,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just mentioned his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually just texted me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can get Rojo on here,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be killer, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my train of thought there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, seven degrees separation,
Kevin Bacon, how we all kind of went
[SPEAKER_05]: through there and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, there was kind of like,
you know, we all knew each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had gone to, you know, motive,
motive 303.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a bunch of great dude barbecues and
gatherings at his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd go over to motives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do some in my house and come over
to mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd go to Skitty's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd go to Bobby O's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be at Howie's, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of like the the home base,
I guess you would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there were people that hung
out with, you know, Cobb and Paco and Rojo
[SPEAKER_00]: and those guys kind of always hung out,
you know, with themselves and then motive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I might be getting,
you know, getting things wrong and who
[SPEAKER_00]: hung out with who.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody had their own little clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Rojo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rojo and Paco and Cobb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're together, I think,
at a spot down here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also the Adam Dunn Cannabis Cup
events you remember those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they started doing those,
me and Mitch originally had planned those
[SPEAKER_05]: out for an event we were going to do
called the Breeders Ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it suddenly got like co-opted into
Adam Dunn's kind of gig.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those are kind of fun, too,
because like you'd have breeders that
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking wanted to kill each other at those
events.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would all just kind of put all our
weapons down as we came in the fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: event and smoked and rather nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a period in time with the
events, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably 10 years ago now,
where it's like 10 years ago, I'd say,
[SPEAKER_00]: was like the height of cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then then they started kind of getting
flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was too many of them and they
were too expensive and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of drowned themselves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Covid came and, you know,
nobody wanted to hang out with anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still recovering now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as far as like a smoking cannabis
scene, and it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people still just sit
down and blaze with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to go to a cup and just
smoke everybody's weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had a cup cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we we have events for our group,
me, CSI, Bodhi, a bunch of us out here in
[SPEAKER_05]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd love to get you guys all to come
out for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If possible, I know it's a hell of a trip,
but we do it out in the last time we did
[SPEAKER_05]: it out by Yosemite, rented a big ass
mansion, crashed for a few days and just
[SPEAKER_05]: smoked tons of different kinds of weed
from everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not very hard, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in the like I really took it from
like the nugs and jugs events,
[SPEAKER_05]: the shit Canterado did and even some of
the Adam Dunn stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was all inspiring to me to be
like, I think we can pull this shit off,
[SPEAKER_05]: where even if people don't necessarily get
along, we can get along for three days
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking weed and talking weed and being
fucking nerds for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: One year we had, you know, Josh D,
all the triangle guys come out,
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene crew came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this next round, I really would love to
have some of you guys come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned from the events that the booth
is like the magic spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have the booth where,
you know, and when I was working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lazy lion, we would always go out of our
way to have one of the biggest booths and
[SPEAKER_00]: to have extra space so people could hang
out and to have that social aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would always tell all these
breeders, like, you don't need a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come set up at my booth and sell
seeds, make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can combine the traffic of
everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked real well for a long time
and everybody was always welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made, I made some great friends
that way and met a ton of people and
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired a ton of seeds, gave a ton of
seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was good times back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope the industry can get back to
there at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to, we got to kind of level out
at some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I think like what we're trying to
do with the show too, is to bring back
[SPEAKER_05]: some of that culture, teach some of the
younger dudes that this shit did exist,
[SPEAKER_05]: does exist, can exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there is something deeper than just
like trying to strain hunt the newest
[SPEAKER_05]: cookies and flashing your and flexing your
shit on Instagram, like you're some big
[SPEAKER_05]: baller, like there's a lot more culture
involved in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like love and brotherhood,
very deep that lasts, last decades and
[SPEAKER_05]: span decades, you know, that they can
become a part of and be involved in if
[SPEAKER_05]: they're good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newer generation too, I think they're
spoiled in the sense that we gave them so
[SPEAKER_00]: much stuff that they didn't have to work
for at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fucking true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these events, like they were
kind of taboo for a while there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, people were scared to go to
cannabis cups like early on, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, they didn't even want to be
associated with them or seen at them or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just the whole shift of how it's
changed over the years and the dynamic of
[SPEAKER_00]: how people approach them and how they're
utilized and stuff, it's interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss how Emerald Cup was out here
because we get a lot of you guys out here
[SPEAKER_05]: for Emerald Cup and like getting to see
guys like Rado, you know, you guys and
[SPEAKER_05]: interacting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was super fucking cool because we
don't, living across the country,
[SPEAKER_05]: we don't get to see each other too often
and a lot of that culture has been lost
[SPEAKER_05]: with the Emerald Cup, how corporate it's
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say Emerald Cup used
to be kind of the thing that everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was looked at as kind of like the
equilibrium where it was fair playing
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and the best of the best was going
to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it turned into sponsorship
dollars.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And seed companies would make like their
money for the year there, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's, you know, make a chunk there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would feed a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen, I've been at the booth,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With people and seen well into the six
figures come in over a weekend for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those weekends, I don't know how
many of them there are these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but back in the day, there were some good
weekends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude, there really isn't any more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like if you're not like a
registered licensed company, you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: getting in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people just don't give a fuck
about that part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not me, of course, I'm totally
legal and follow every law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought I thought Emerald Cup
probably peaked in like 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, it just kind of got
like, you know, more more just
[SPEAKER_02]: corporatized and more about the business
than than actually an event for growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was always good going out there
because like as a grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can go to all these other cups and,
you know, high times cannabis cup or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you didn't really have access to like
the genetics and what was really
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Emerald Cup, whatever,
I go see a doctor for five minutes right
[SPEAKER_02]: there in line to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he checks my arm and then I'm going in
the back medical area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and I get to like talk to
the breeders and they have jars of flour
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can open it, touch it, smell it
before I buy the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you couldn't do that online.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as a grower, it was the number
one event because like you could touch and
[SPEAKER_02]: feel the genetics before you grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so that's a that was a game
changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they got rid of that,
I was like, there's no point in going
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I felt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stopped participating myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone always used to bring their
special drops to the Emerald Cup to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, their big crosses and their big
drops and drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I used my my Emerald Cup budget
was flowing every year and far exceeded on
[SPEAKER_00]: beans and stuff that I'd come back with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are always gifting,
you know, coming to the booth and dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff off and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so the genetics that the Emerald
Cup provided hands down the best event.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some good high times cannabis
cups in, you know, Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was out there the first year for
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Denver one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The very first Denver cannabis cup.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can't remember if if that was
the year I brought cornbread Ricky out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the year Karma actually won the
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: His very first cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, fuck one.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time, I thought one of the good
guys won, but he ended up snitching on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Karma did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure fucking did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other hard part, man,
is, you know, everybody has their list of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that they don't fuck with,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with the cabana, I've been trying
to make it a place where everybody can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, be friends with.
[SPEAKER_00]: With everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I've been I've been trying so
hard to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have encountered a couple of walls
where it's like, oh, so and so this and so
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that I'm like, bro, grown man,
this is the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignore him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not too fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like even for me, who's a very
aggressive personality and like really
[SPEAKER_05]: have our time shut in my mouth,
like it's kind of nice to have the cabana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I've even dropped some beefs with
people that I fucking hated since day one,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, people that trolled the first my
first troll, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we reached out to each other and just
like, dude, how old are we now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just fucking chill.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's been nice for that reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and it's opened up a lot of bridges
for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like some of us grow over the years
and get used to that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like even with the karma thing,
like that was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like at the same time, I'm past it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's always extenuating
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like if a cabana was that because
you had to go through this invite process
[SPEAKER_02]: and they were more strict about,
you know, starting shit that you didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have just like trolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, we were all on like IC mag
and all these other sites for that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and and you could just create
another account, create another email,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, go on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could talk shit about yourself as a
way to hype yourself up as a seed brand
[SPEAKER_02]: because just to get drama started or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but you couldn't none of that
was flying on the cabana because I got
[SPEAKER_04]: booted so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had to like beg, you know,
beg to get back on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd have like long
conversations, like three, four hours with
[SPEAKER_02]: with Howie, with the admins and like,
all right, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were zero tolerance policies and
then there were cabana zero tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: policies, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they took them to another level back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were actually needed at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really were.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it offered it made the cabana a place
that for I mean, for so many reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that one specifically made it
different than the other places,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, because somebody got in there and
mouthing off like it was it was deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I never I never held me hard
feelings because I always knew it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the old guard at the cabana and
they don't put up with that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I never held me hard feelings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, yeah, I probably fucking too
far on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like he was going to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to self check a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they've always been even after that,
though, they were always fucking cool to
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's always been a place close to my
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with the cabana and me, you know,
there was I did a lot of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't exactly like the cabana friendly
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't on there actively for a long
time, but I'd still be belly boating with
[SPEAKER_00]: Howie on the weekends and going fishing
and at all the barbecues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so I don't have many posts
on the cabana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never like the most active guy on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but it's because I was working with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with all these breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing all these testers and boom,
they don't like seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, growing weed for this giant
dad bar where it's like a smoke facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we don't want to promote that to
the to the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's just things I was doing
that weren't cabana friendly, but I was
[SPEAKER_00]: still always around with the cabana and,
you know, skitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give him a ton of props because to this
day, I still grow just my own version of
[SPEAKER_00]: skitty tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's all essentially the same
kind of technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I switch up my nutrients and I've done
things, you know, tons of different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: where skitty is pretty tried and true and
he does not deviate from his script very
[SPEAKER_00]: often and still rocking it with tremendous
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: To this day and skitty was the first dude
that I met like years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 2011 where he's like,
yeah, I only got like three point one per
[SPEAKER_02]: light on this round.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm going to do better next
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, everybody used to
throw those numbers around on the forums
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're like, yeah, bro, whatever forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but like I had the, you know,
I see his garden, I see how meticulous he
[SPEAKER_02]: was and his canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I even went there just to trim for him
a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to see what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, bro, he's really do way what
he says they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, he was, you know,
like Curb said, there's a lot of just
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he, he, he just was like,
he just had his method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I mean, it was kind of like early
crop steering before he knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he'd be watering them a couple of
times a day by hand, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: skitty steering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but yeah, sometimes he's a hand
water four times a day, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and, and we didn't understand that
then like more water, more news equals
[SPEAKER_02]: more yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like, isn't it already
wet?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that matter?
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but, but yeah, he, he,
he really proved that because yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I mean, back in the day,
like on the forums, everybody like said,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, you know, it was hard to prove
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody's real yields and everyone's
setups was worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was primitive, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like we had D Hughes on the
ceiling and it like, we were just flat job
[SPEAKER_02]: and even, even bigger, bigger grows a
hundred lighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we were using residential ACs and
like, we didn't really know what we were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing then, you know, from an engineering
with design standpoint, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so it was just cool to have that
open sharing of knowledge, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like what was different for the cabana
was just, it was so genetic centered and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, like Curb said at the
beginning, like, you know, it was all,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just like opened a door, like,
you know, like the gatekeepers had finally
[SPEAKER_02]: opened the gates to like all the hoarded
clone onlys of the time that you only read
[SPEAKER_02]: about that, you know, we're like,
we were like, ah, it's finally my turn to
[SPEAKER_02]: be the cool kid, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could finally see pictures,
good grows of some of these things that
[SPEAKER_05]: you'd only heard about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, you know, I mean, when you'd
look on ICMAG, you'd see people growing it
[SPEAKER_05]: and it'd be like nine, obviously different
plants that weren't related, but finally
[SPEAKER_05]: on the cabana, you could see legit shit
being grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was something special,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and it's, and it's one of the
things I'm telling people now,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, why should you visit the cabana?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you can finally see that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can finally go look and see all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's there, you know, like this is,
this is important historical
[SPEAKER_05]: documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do encourage people to dig through these
forums, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look through some of these old posts
and you will be shocked at who you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiming in and discussing things back in
the day when it was like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ghost OG was the hot thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I knew we had the real ghost
cause how we got the ghost from ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, uh, there was never any
question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the authenticity of clone when people
really started like trading genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a blessing and a curse at the same
time, because you got the people who got
[SPEAKER_00]: the real genetics and we'll share them and
get them out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got other people who will
take any old thing and just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're somebody trapping out,
a 10 lighter or 20 lighter, or,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's your main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your whole garden riding on this,
riding on this SFV, OG clone or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's, it's some boof shit that's
not the real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, even if it's good,
but it's not SFV, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the hard part was confirming
things, but the cabana, everything was
[SPEAKER_00]: like already confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICMAG, THC Farmer, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything came like with a level of
skepticism.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much fucking shenanigans on
those places, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even, there's not a lot good I can
say about those places to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, granted, I love all those places
and I encourage everybody, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want every, back in the day I was on THC
Farmer, ICMAG, um, Troll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was never on roll it up,
but uh, Ivan from Jungle Boys had his own
[SPEAKER_00]: little forum like that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember what it was called
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Kanna Collective, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might've been a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, that was the, uh, after that,
that forum pot pimp went down,
[SPEAKER_05]: it became Kanna Collective.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember pot pimp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the UK group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a dumb ass name for a forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another one that like,
um, like cornbread and a couple of guys
[SPEAKER_02]: were on that was, uh, a bunch of Cali guys
were running it, like Sway and those guys
[SPEAKER_02]: from like Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and everybody would always be in the
chat room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the name of that site?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like trying to be like the cabana,
but it never really took off other than
[SPEAKER_02]: the chat room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chat room is the people like late
at night talking shit while their res is
[SPEAKER_02]: filling up basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was always formally disinvited from
these places, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, uh, we'll be at IC mags.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't sell my seeds there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then logic and the farm, there's a
actual, like when you Google Matt riot,
[SPEAKER_05]: first thing that pops up is Matt riot is a
total douche bag on the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they love them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They love my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were actual like forum superstars
back in the day and forum villains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would definitely fit the villain
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might've been a villain, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of guess it like, uh,
you know, who's troll account you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interacting with, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew, we knew, uh, a few, uh,
pretty infamous trolls or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, uh, we have a buddy who he might,
he, he could be up there and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: top trolls in the game, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still too big, I think was his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he's a real life troll and,
uh, he's also one of the best dudes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would give you a shirt off his back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I strolls go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was our troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he disseminated more genetics that
were supposed to have restrictions on them
[SPEAKER_02]: than anybody I ever met.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just like, he was like,
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not supposed to give the same to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give it to like 50 people
with conditions for getting your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: with conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was saying, like, don't even tell
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the second you tell him like,
Oh, you can't have this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one he's taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to do whatever he's going to go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's going to come up the stairs
and tell you, Hey, I just stole that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's having his ear, like a,
like a pencil or a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just had the clone there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to start getting into some of
you dudes, like what your specialties are.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your specialty?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, where did you take cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where'd you find your niche in this,
uh, wide world, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, that's a tough one to
answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I do have a specialty,
it's just, uh, you know, being able to,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, put a concept together and,
you know, get people excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, follow through on the
execution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, for, from a growing
perspective, uh, uh, a lot of the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're working on now is all new to
me, like the, the crop steering stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, all of the science associated
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, uh, we're, we're all,
uh, uh, used to growing in the basement
[SPEAKER_03]: and then had a brief, uh, a bit of
greenhouse growing experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, no, the, the legal and,
uh, commercial stuff is like fairly new to
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how's that been for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, uh, uh, the, there there's a good
and bad with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't have to worry about anyone
kicking in my door anymore, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, going through, uh,
testing, uh, sucks a lot and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, dealing with metric and
just, you know, the stress associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with, uh, running a legal business is,
uh, on a different level than,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, anything legacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: How has HPLV affected, uh, anything that
you're doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, knock on wood, uh,
no effects so far, but, um, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we, uh, we, we've done a lot of
our, uh, own pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we tried to, we tried to,
you know, do a lot of our stuff from seed
[SPEAKER_03]: just so that, uh, we're able to find out
which genetics are really working in our
[SPEAKER_03]: facility, in our environment, you know,
for the practices that, uh, we're,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're implementing.
So.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the genetics that fit your grow dude,
like that's something a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: don't understand is, you know,
like you hear about the hype strains and
[SPEAKER_05]: you want them for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to make it work and it's not
always how it goes, you know, so you have
[SPEAKER_05]: to find ones that fit your grow,
fit your environment or that you can morph
[SPEAKER_05]: just a little bit to grow with the strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at a certain point, you know,
you're, you're, it's just fighting to try
[SPEAKER_05]: to make something fit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it doesn't fit, you must not
acquit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all we're doing right now is just
kind of, you know, genetically throwing
[SPEAKER_03]: shit at the wall and seeing what sticks,
you know, it's like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we, we gotta understand, you know,
not only what is going to work in our
[SPEAKER_03]: facility, but what is there a market for
as well, which isn't always easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: determine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what, what kind of stuff do you find
right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of stuff are you interested in
right now in your facility that seems to
[SPEAKER_05]: be working?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, I mean, we just did a,
uh, a seed run of, uh, candy fumes,
[SPEAKER_03]: which, uh, I'm pretty excited about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're still waiting for testing to
come back on that, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got several phenos that look pretty
promising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this next run, we're going to be
putting in some, uh, uh, we've got three
[SPEAKER_03]: different phenos of women, maraschino from
swamp boys that, uh, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: committing a little bit more space to,
um, and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like I, anytime you hear some of
these old dudes like swamp boys getting
[SPEAKER_05]: some respect, I like to hear that making
their way into the modern market,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been, uh, um, a notorious good pheno
selector too, over the years, whenever you
[SPEAKER_00]: pop some beans, you usually find some
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I need to send Oki some shit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't leave them off the list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, if you're wanting to run through
some insane blue turps, I got you bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a blueberry fiend and I've made it my
mission to make the best blueberry
[SPEAKER_05]: possible on earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're there, so I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about some of your journey now and
what you're doing now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's up until like 2016,
2017, I was still in the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy gray market, whatever you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's a different name every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and, uh, a buddy of mine
who's, who's also from the forums and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, around older cat kind of got me
into consulting and, uh, was always into a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the nutritive side of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, had been, you know, they're making my
own custom nude formulas, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: dry salts and, uh, eventually kind of did
a lot of stuff with soil, soil analysis,
[SPEAKER_02]: really thrown some science at soil
techniques rather than just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, you know, I was lucky
through, through consulting that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I got to step into some pretty
big facilities and start to learn,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of how to talk to talk with
those people and, and, and gain some
[SPEAKER_02]: business acumen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, um, you know, uh, soon after
that, like 2019, 2020, uh, really up until
[SPEAKER_02]: last year, uh, that whole period that,
that, you know, four or five years,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I spent in various just director roles
around the country, um, at, at large or
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, nothing really stuck,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and, and a lot of places,
you know, I was just grinding myself to
[SPEAKER_02]: the bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it was either like, you know,
it just wasn't a fit as far as the
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry with the owners or they were
just like, I came in as their like fifth
[SPEAKER_02]: rower and the place was a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I, you can only fix it so much
because they're broke or they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: through a lawsuit or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like the hardest position to be
put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, you know, and I met some good
people in that world as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, kind of learned how to
manage people a little bit better and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, manage my time, manage, you know,
tasks and software and, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just do other things that you
didn't really do as a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but always kind of going back to
the nutritive side, always like focused
[SPEAKER_02]: on, um, efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, both Oki and I are both
engineers by, you know, academically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you're always thinking
efficiencies and, and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully not the sacrifice quality,
but just asking like the, the hows and the
[SPEAKER_02]: whys of a lot of the things you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, and, and taking that
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now I'm working with horse
row cocoa, um, which has actually been
[SPEAKER_02]: great to me in something ancillary,
not running one of these facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're based in, uh,
Santa Cruz, Watsonville, um, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, small company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm employee number two on the,
on the U S side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically doing all the, the,
the product business development for the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis side of it and working with a lot
of growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, back in 2019, uh, I was running a big
place up in Washington and we were burning
[SPEAKER_02]: through a couple of different brands of
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're, you know, that's when like
cocoa, I feel like cocoa was really
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing up at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wanted to grow in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like hyper legalization was
spreading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's building these mega facilities
and, uh, and there was a lot of just fly
[SPEAKER_02]: by night cocoa brands that were salty or
had root acids or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, so we all went through
it and, uh, and that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I started applying different, like lab
analysis and different things to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I always just went back to
Horcrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, this is actually a really good
product, small company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could text the CEO.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll make something special for me if I
want, and just circle back to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, started just like working
with them at MJ biz and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: conferences, just to interface for growers
and, you know, be someone knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_02]: for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, just January this year,
they asked me to come on full time with
[SPEAKER_02]: them and it's been a total pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been funny that my, my social media
has like, grown way more in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cannabis cultivation community,
like working for them than it did as like
[SPEAKER_02]: a trap guy with like, even with like all
the breeder connections and everything I
[SPEAKER_02]: have with none of that matters,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's been a blessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a cocoa fiend and we need to talk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get, I'll get you some samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got the cabana code for anybody,
uh, on the cabana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go check out the hort grow forum
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris will answer any questions you got
and get a coupon code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you order up some hort grow,
you get 15% off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude, we'll do the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want, we could do the same with the
breeder syndicate too, and fucking push
[SPEAKER_05]: some people your way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause a lot of people like to grow like I
grow and I'm a cocoa fiend, a purest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a hundred percent vouch for hort
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Chris and I were actually working in a
facility out here in Oklahoma together
[SPEAKER_00]: last year or the year before I can't time
flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ran the whole thing on,
uh, one gallon expandable cocoa pots from
[SPEAKER_00]: hort grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're using right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's what we're running in our
facility right now as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hort grow one gallon open tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking awesome too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what kind of strains are you working
with right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your newest schtick over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've got a, uh, a Fino of a triangle
clean from, um, um, relentless,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, uh, really a triangle dominant
Fino that just has like a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: cherry, uh, on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we really like that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, uh, um, you know, it's,
it's taking a while for the market to,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, discover it just cause it's not like,
you know, bright purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but, uh, but a lot of people are
discovering it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's going to be one that we
kind of become known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to bring green weed back
in 2024.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, like relentless.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like, that's one of the few.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dudes that came in after I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, I, I really did a bad job of
like keeping track.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause so many people came in like,
you know, when I first started,
[SPEAKER_05]: there was maybe 50 people doing it big
worldwide, like selling seeds in mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now there's, you know, 10,000 seed
companies via Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: And relentless was one of the few that I
actually respect the dude quite a bit real
[SPEAKER_05]: super nice dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate what he's doing and he's
doing good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of his, uh, rotten crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come across his rotten cherries or
rotten bananas or anything, all of his
[SPEAKER_00]: rotten crosses that I've seen fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of good shit about his
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's one person I want to collab with
in the future, just because I,
[SPEAKER_05]: I like, uh, I like seeing the next
generation take it to a new level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's one of the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about some of the cabana
stuff and where, what kind of stuff are
[SPEAKER_05]: you going to be implementing?
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it going to change from where it
was?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, when I, you know, was on it for a
while and then off and then on and then
[SPEAKER_05]: off and then on, and how is it going to go
into the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most important thing for everyone to take
in is that we are open to the public now,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can go register right now,
um, set up an account and you'll have full
[SPEAKER_00]: access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, uh, tiered memberships.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have to pay for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is completely free to the
community and a lot of old school
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying hard to get the new generation
to come over and check us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they'll find, you know,
some educational things and some
[SPEAKER_00]: information that, uh, you know,
it makes worth, uh, checking out the
[SPEAKER_00]: cabana on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The link scrolling across the bottom of
the screen for anybody watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, should be no question where
you're headed to the other things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing is, uh, pretty much all the
rules and old restrictions that were once
[SPEAKER_00]: there, um, are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a breeder and you are making
seeds, like, man, come tell us about these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, compose them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come trade seeds with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I might offer you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might want, I might want some of those
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want everybody to know that,
uh, it's a seed friendly community,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sell some beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people hitting you up in the
DMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want some beans by all means, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to, uh, be able to
utilize the cabana as a tool and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they get a valuable asset for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing about the cabana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, probably more, maybe not just in just
sheer numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause places like IC mag and some of these
people have like so many registered
[SPEAKER_00]: members cause they've been open for 20
years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, we have so many breeders on the
cabana and people who have just been
[SPEAKER_00]: making beans in their closet for 20 years
and have, uh, a seed arsenal that would,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, make most of us sweat if we
looked at it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I'm going to make it so those,
those seeds are going to be available to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give the small guys a way to,
um, get their beans out into the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so we're going to work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a store coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we got, uh, lots of breeders already
involved and the breeders that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it's going to be easy to get more
involvement from these breeders as we get
[SPEAKER_00]: more involvement from the community,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people are like, Oh, they're not
on there that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they will be, if, you know,
if there was a reason for them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there, they'll come, you know,
nobody's up on there just because I picked
[SPEAKER_00]: a company that I thought was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I talked to everybody, everybody's
down with the mission and it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter of getting our traffic up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, getting the vibe back
to where it kind of used to be and how we
[SPEAKER_00]: get there and how we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're throwing, uh, lots of ideas out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if anybody's got ideas or you got
an idea that you think like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be dope if the forums did it
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I want this forum to be for us,
for the people who appreciate the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's the best form it can be
for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, for, uh, four 20, I don't know if
you guys are down for it, but me and CSI
[SPEAKER_05]: both, uh, worked on some diesel fans and,
uh, my new blueberry shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's give some away, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do a little contest something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspector just sent me a bunch of gear and
there were some diesel crosses in there,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with the cabana being open to
the public, it, it gives everybody a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to come check it out and everybody
can register and be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really liked that even doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've added over a thousand members
and stuff since we, you know, been open
[SPEAKER_00]: for three months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it still maintains like the old kind
of cabana vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's being super respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't really have any trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if we did, like, I don't really have,
you know, super high tolerance for
[SPEAKER_00]: internet dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just delete it and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a big argument or
scene about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's what we've been trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody, uh, everybody's like it
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, hearing from new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that, you know, going to come back
and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, last week I was having
breakfast with Katsu and, um, he,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he's like, uh, he's got his own
forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his own store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got their own discords.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got half a dozen social media
profiles that they have to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just fighting for our space
and we have to prove our value to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, get everybody to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, the old school people,
like we, we got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's going to be a new
appreciation for the old school and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they had and what they had to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think these exotics are kind of
running their course right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, everybody is kind of,
I'm hearing gas and cam and diesel and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything that I like, everything
that I like kind of making a resurgence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, uh, even haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even haze, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any haze, but you know,
Phil, Phil Rojo had some killer haze
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this man had some killer shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He probably still does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me send Phil this link, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get him in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get Phil on here because this is the
man that was in national geographic.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was one of the, you know what,
honestly, he was one of the main reasons I
[SPEAKER_05]: went out to Colorado when I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wanted to meet this dude,
um, who had done so much and made such an
[SPEAKER_05]: impact during those years in Colorado when
he was really thriving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I knew he was going big places and
like, I'm one of those guys where I really
[SPEAKER_05]: believe like attracts like, and if you
want to be successful, surround yourself
[SPEAKER_05]: with people who think successful and are
optimistic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking themselves forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was one of them, you know,
and he always shared his time with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very respectful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I have a lot of respect for that dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phil is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly, I can't even remember how I
met Phil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was through, through the forum somehow,
but when I met him, uh, he would,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had a big warehouse over off,
uh, I 70 in Denver and I'd go over there
[SPEAKER_00]: and I used to buy seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was buying seeds nonstop money,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was coming from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I just want to interject to give
me crap when I wouldn't spend like at
[SPEAKER_02]: least six K a month on seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, bro, what are you doing with
your life right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like wasting your money on seeds
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But go ahead and continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no one can ever say I haven't put my
money where my mouth is when it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would buy seeds just to give them to
Rojo and just so he could pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, he would let me store
moms over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's been, there's been
some people who, you know, I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to throw anyone under the bus,
but, uh, there's been people who've stolen
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of genetics at a, that facility that
have gone on to start companies and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we can go ahead and say Colin ethos,
uh, he goes, he goes, I think he goes,
[SPEAKER_05]: he goes genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, uh, you know, he worked over there
for a while and he got some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he ended up working over at my other
buddy's, uh, facility, new age medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, got a ton of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, boom, ethos seed collection was formed
not long afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not well liked, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Phil was always awesome because he,
he was the first person that I think he
[SPEAKER_00]: really recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: In me at least that like, I was about that
seed life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one year from my birthday,
he came over to my house and he popped up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a Ziploc bag full of beans and they
were all Tom Hill Hayes crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, Tom Hayes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba, Tom Hayes, skunk Valley Hayes,
um, so many things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I gave them away for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me he was like, man, just,
you know, anybody who wants these just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, get them in their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do auctions to, you know,
help raise money for various people on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sending them 10, 20 seeds or 10,
20 packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one year for the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave, uh, I did these breeder bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like 60 bags, 60 packs of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I collected, I had a bunch of beans
that obsolete had set on a bunch of beans
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had a bunch, uh, stuff from La Plata
labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a great dude too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Joey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually, uh, not far from me in
Oklahoma out here right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you telling him, I said, what's up,
dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's always been really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, he's one of those dudes who I
think is also super slept on because he
[SPEAKER_00]: was making beans and packaging up beans
and kind of grind in on the underground
[SPEAKER_00]: Stateside scene, like before most people
were man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he had, he's got some great
stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a Durango OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was called.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote it and some white voodoo and some
big white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lemon aliens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had some good stuff back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of respect for that dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: He started getting really big,
but I think he just kind of backed off a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit from the scene and,
uh, slowed down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the respect still there
definitely for him from, uh, I think he
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing, uh, some hemp stuff and I
know he was doing some stuff, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, internationally as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he stays busy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posted up some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those guys who can go away and
you don't hear from them or see anything
[SPEAKER_00]: from them for like three or four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he posts up some picture of like
some mega greenhouse that's going 400
[SPEAKER_00]: yards full of fucking can more than my
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for fucking sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he always stays with a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Phil would give me tons of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to the lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Phil also hooked me up with,
uh, a guy named Mike Finnelli and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he does a ton of, uh, um, like grow
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll get your room all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was working with, uh, oh man,
kicked myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, uh, these old controllers,
what were the old controllers called
[SPEAKER_00]: before the troll masters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what it was called,
but, uh, he helped design those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he worked with a guy named Bo who
owned chlorophyll up here in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just like a nutrient,
you know, just a little, uh, hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he plugged me up with so many people
that, um, just because I knew Phil took
[SPEAKER_00]: extra good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was getting the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the plug on nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I got the plug on the room design
and the build out and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these guys came down and they
moved into the warehouse with me down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, they're missing out 24,
you know, around the clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they grind and, uh, that just comes
from his kind of his work mentality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think if you would have stuck
with the black market scene, at least he
[SPEAKER_05]: would have been a much more on the CSI
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And respect, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but dip in a way, you know,
a lot of people don't remember him as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think his name deserves more respect
and should be back out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those guys too, who's always
doing a breeding project and probably got
[SPEAKER_00]: like walk in freezers full of gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I need to see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get up in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already been asking him, I was like,
Hey, remember when you gave me all those
[SPEAKER_00]: beans, you should do something like that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but man, Phil is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably one of my biggest,
uh, I mean, he's like somebody I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: looked up to in the weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he always did it a big,
and as I started getting into managing
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facilities and, um,
bigger projects and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you realize like the undertaking that they
actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody, everybody can grow good
weed, but can you grow, can you do it at
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and growing it at scale is,
uh, just bigger challenges, bigger risks,
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If something goes wrong and, uh,
your four lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot easier to recover from,
you know, a 40 light room issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're looking at a bunch of
bald guys right now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I probably would have
had the confidence to do, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: these bigger facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I hadn't been able to spend the time
asking questions and seeing Rojo's
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and how the things that he was
doing to, um, just make everything run
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth and just well oiled machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you got to have on a
commercial level.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of got a question for you,
Kirby, when we first met, you were
[SPEAKER_05]: curbside extracts, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking about some of that shit
about any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been curbside service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since like middle school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and then I was curbside
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always, I've always curbside
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my little brother gives me shit
because I just do everything under a flag
[SPEAKER_00]: of curbside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always known as Kirby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, like, um, you were the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day I got, uh, everyone
started, my boy brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: A five gallon bucket back from California
and it had like honey oil in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like BHO honey oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking to Home Depot, five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, and nor had I smoked
anything like it at the time either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, man, this is from
BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, I started doing all this
research and on the cabana, there's a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is gray wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever done any form of BHO
extract, you know, I'm sure you've ran
[SPEAKER_00]: across some, something that led you to
gray wolf at some point, but he put me on
[SPEAKER_00]: game to this place back in the day called
glacier tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say they were up in Oregon
or Washington or somewhere in Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started buying all these stainless
steel tubes and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: my dad, uh, owns a welding company and
it's got a machine shop and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, when I had an idea,
it was easy for me to execute like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I would get these stainless steel
tubes and I had like 50 of them and three
[SPEAKER_00]: feet by an inch and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could pack them with a half pound
of weed and, um, I started ordering,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, Entane and I was in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I was the first person
that wanted Entane because when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: asking general layer, which is like the
biggest gas supplier out in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country, like, man,
I need some butane and they were just for
[SPEAKER_00]: what, what, what could you possibly need?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a bottle of butane for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, they had to do some research to
even find it, to see if they could get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ended up getting it from Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd have to give them heads up,
um, when I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started just telling them,
I was like, here's your heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep shipping it up here and like
have me on a rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had, I had quick connects and I
just, boom, turn my bottle of butane on
[SPEAKER_00]: blast through a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it into a one gallon glass pitcher,
pour it into a pie pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a long time, I don't want to say a
long time for a short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting more money doing 50 50
splits with people than I was like on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone would give me their crop and I was
able to pay them more for their crop off
[SPEAKER_00]: of their 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they could even get selling a hundred
percent of it in flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was so damn much need for it at the
time that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, there's not a lot of markets
that I've hit at the right time where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I got in like right at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't one of the, I was early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so not a lot of people had volume like
I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, to this day, to this day,
one of my best friends, he's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was out in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was up on the Hill, you know,
15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and he, he went out to one of Kirby's
barbecues in Aurora.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, when curve had first built like
the first closed loop and he was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro, even to this day, like my,
my buddy and Cali will be like your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your boy Kirby was like ahead of the
curve, ahead of everybody on the closed
[SPEAKER_02]: loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's, that's the one thing I think
you're pretty legendary for in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I think of Kirby, I think of all
those like back trays, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just never seen anybody do it so big at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closed loop tech too came from the
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I can't remember who did it or
the name of the, what even form it was on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was, uh, uh, some pressurized paint
cans that, uh, I did my first closed loop
[SPEAKER_00]: out of, out of Harbor freight pressurized
paint cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so I've done it every single way
possible, uh, good ways and bad ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I did the bad ways early on the
open blasting and fucking, and then it got
[SPEAKER_00]: to a point where it just, the science of
it all outgrew me and these new guys with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of their closed loop techs and,
um, the things that they're doing to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: up the fats and the lipids and all,
you know, all the things, uh, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, one of my boys went the other way
to Roslyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Roslyn, man, where he's dried
Roslyn, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another Phil story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Rojo story is, uh, I was going
out, I was going to, his warehouse and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, kind bill, uh, was working there doing
the extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they were telling me about this
new thing that they had done, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Oh man, we've invented live
resin and, um, it's, uh, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the turf profiles are this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started showing it to me and they
were like telling me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, all you got to do is
freeze it and then just do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to freeze it beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I was like, well, fuck,
bro, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so they were telling me,
they're like, yeah, you gotta,
[SPEAKER_00]: you gotta get a cryo freezer and they're
this expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't even have the cryo freezer
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just telling me, like,
they were going to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't even, I don't think I'd even
started my car up.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the parking lot before I had ordered
a cryo freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so for 500 bucks off eBay,
man, I had a used cryo freezer shipped up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I started doing live resin and,
uh, I taught my boy Lord rude boy how to
[SPEAKER_00]: blast and process material when we're at
the lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's one of those guys where it's just
like when the student becomes the master
[SPEAKER_00]: because he just took it to a whole nother
level and, uh, he can do it all,
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate, rise in, you know,
he's, he's a hash master.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you real quick explain for me the
definition of live resin?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something I've never been able,
cause I know you were at the base of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the true definition of live resin
as it was originally meant to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, it's just the preservation
of the freshest turps possible by freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: it as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cut it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always, I always assumed like they were
taking the live plants still in the pot,
[SPEAKER_05]: like smashing it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the only way I had no clue what
it meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why you want the cryo freezer
because it gets colder faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can cut your plant down and there's
less wilting and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in the freezing process, how much of a
difference does it make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it does make a difference because you
get less condensation and you get less
[SPEAKER_00]: water buildup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but did the resins mature before you
do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not if you're like literally cutting
it down, putting it in a bag, getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make a difference to some
degree?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally how fast you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to cut it down,
let your plant sit outside for an hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: two hours before it gets bagged up and put
it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you want to chop it,
get it in the bag, get it in the freezer,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that sounds like a forum argument
already though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, someone would be like,
nah, bro, my shit's so dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave it out for a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll still make better hash than your
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like I think about it, like with
blueberry, like a lot of the blueberries
[SPEAKER_05]: need to cure for a month before they get
their blueberry turps back in form.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just wondering how different that
would be, how different that would be with
[SPEAKER_05]: live resin and if it would be worth it to
do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, man, I think it's totally worth it
to compare the differences between a live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin turp and a well cured turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're going to be totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're harvesting a plant on
harvest day, when you're cutting it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: it smells different than when it's smoke
day after it's cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same principle with live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're cutting it down with that turp
profile that you're preserving at that
[SPEAKER_00]: moment in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was stuff like strawberry cream
though, that smelled like strawberry
[SPEAKER_05]: straight off the bush, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be perfect for live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had, uh, obsolete had sent me a
bunch of his orange crosses when he had
[SPEAKER_00]: first made the orange juice, but,
and I had, you know, the orange juice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but times sour Doug times ghosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So G times, um, G S C to, I can't even
remember all of them, but that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dab bar down in Colorado Springs at
the lazy lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like what made us
famous, man, was these live resin orange
[SPEAKER_00]: turps that we had down there because like
people were kind of just getting into dads
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some regular dab and be coughing
and like, it was almost a painful
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then like, when people started like,
you know, turps started coming through on
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs and, you know, the live resin and all
of that, like it changed how people were
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially with the orange juice,
that's just citrus as fuck from the jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Undeniable flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those, uh, you know,
obsolete just posted up on Instagram that
[SPEAKER_00]: his, uh, orange apricot got voted like
best turps and yeah, they're still doing
[SPEAKER_05]: like a legend orange apricot stuff like,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, those turps definitely need to be
preserved for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately those original crosses,
and I know OBS still has a few packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to get them off of them and,
and, uh, he needs to hold onto him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs to do something with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, those turps men out of that
batch, those were probably some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best turps that's come out of a,
of a public seed release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know like how public
those were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he really sold them or if
he just kind of gave me an orange bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, man, probably some of the best
turps that hit the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed them a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're real good orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to take a quick moment and
thank everyone for showing up again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirby and all the homies from,
from the Kavanaugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they're always amazing episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are real passionate through
seed collectors and what they're doing at
[SPEAKER_05]: the Kavanaugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really supportive of, again,
decanacavana.com is where you go to sign
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you can also go to riotseeds.com
again, to pick up our blue berry and cross
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's multiple hybrids of the
blueberry and cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also for four 20, which we're going to
announce on four 18, we got the high and
[SPEAKER_05]: lonesome's new mango Hayes drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we finally have Matt elites,
uh, different Chem D I-95 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been working on it for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are in my opinion, the best Chem 91
regular seeds where you can reliably pick
[SPEAKER_05]: out like amplify side Chem 91 Terps,
along with a bunch of really true breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: through OG Kush seed lines and regular
lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can make your own OG Kush seed
lines with the mills from this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Matt elite stuff is above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's why I've hounded him for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only going to be a few packs
available of each.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wants to, he doesn't think there's
going to be a lot of interest because he's
[SPEAKER_05]: missed the seed market the last,
I don't know, four or five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please go check that out at riotseeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have right seeds, Seco Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Gert by seeds in Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course, lifted seeds in
California, um, takes credit card
[SPEAKER_05]: processing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great guy carries can Illuminati members.
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't recommend them highly enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we're going to try to get the
blueberry and cross out to Australia,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, possibly Europe, depending on you
know, how everything works out,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe Brazil, the Brazil drop is coming
very soon, very, very soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a bunch of our FEM
stuff over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah, don't forget we have the
diesel FEM stuff on the site.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's multiple different diesel crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the skunkiest stuff you're going
to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we also have stuff from sub Rob under
seed trip in the FEM section.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a skank dog and SSS DH,
which is his 98 super silver Hayes cross
[SPEAKER_05]: to sour dub.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour dub is dank fucking clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you miss it, you miss it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all there is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I always say this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't reiterate it enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: When things sell out, people will ask me
where it's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: They finally get into it with the Johnny
cum Lately's and it's gone.

[SPEAKER_05]: The cabana is really important to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to CSI.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want everyone to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want everyone to use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah, we plan on it being our
