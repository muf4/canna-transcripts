[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_02]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_02]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_03]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this kind of rolls in as a hot start
with me and Damian Abraham.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who don't know,
Damian is from the band.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I guess it's the first minute,
so I'll probably get in trouble for
[SPEAKER_03]: cussing, but it's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The band fucked up, but he's also really
well known for his work with Vice Magazine
[SPEAKER_03]: early on, a lot of the documentaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just a legend in the punk rock scene,
especially for the historical part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: punk rock scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also a major cannabis advocate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've been on each other's shows
now, and I really wanted to do one with
[SPEAKER_03]: him here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all punk rock based, which I
thought it would probably be more punk
[SPEAKER_03]: rock based.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that a lot of people that are
in Kana aren't necessarily as interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in punk rock, but this one applies,
I think, to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think everyone's really going to dig
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pleasure recording with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, we kind of just slide right
into the conversation because that's how
[SPEAKER_03]: we roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm drinking coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never drink coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that is that to edge or off edge?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is my coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I definitely if I didn't smoke
cannabis after the birth of my children,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what would have gotten me
through those sleepless nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the that finally broke my
edge, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was that it was having kids being
on anxiety pill anti anxiety position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having to cycle on and off them to get
people to write lyrics, which is a side
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't they don't bring that side
effect up in the preamble.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depletes creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I just I don't know what it is,
but I guess it just kind of like because
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, mutes the highs and lows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, I guess it's hard to get to
those places creatively, at least for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there's lots of people that
find it completely pain free to write on
[SPEAKER_01]: anti anxiety pills and are very creative
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I definitely would have to cycle
on and off home and cycled off home and
[SPEAKER_01]: arrived in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in Amsterdam or the Netherlands
now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and just was like, can I hit that
joint that you guys got to my band?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all kind of shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said I broke edge before,
but I had not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get off the joint and immediately
kind of was like, oh, this is what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I experimented with cannabis in the
the dirty nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, you know, there were like four,
I guess, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different types is what we knew,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even know them as strains or not
as cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this guy's got one that's like it
must be laced with coke because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like really crystaly,
I guess, like looking back on it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or there's one guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, oh, this guy's stuff is
definitely laced because it's just like so
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so I'd experimented with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've been stoned maybe once or
twice previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I tried acid and that was more my
speed before I went straight edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like psychedelics and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just so hit or miss what you
were getting back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I didn't know how to inhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I think I'm getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm getting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I felt it in style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, first time I had my first
cigarette, my first beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first joint, my first hit of acid was
all one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How old were you?
[SPEAKER_00]: 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good age for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a 15 year old upstairs right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I gotta be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into that parenting with
cannabis later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried it and came back and told my
doctor, you know, fast forward to when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying it as a, as a 30 year old and was
like, like I found something that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took away my anxiety and there's no
side effects on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, no way that is doctor
wasn't too receptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is like, this is pre like Canada
legalization came, you know, obviously in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of different phases, but I think
like the lead up to it, there was sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: this like, medical rush that kind of
started where all doctors got on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of doctors realize they get rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In these cannabis clinics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my doctor eventually kind of came
around just before that, but it was only
[SPEAKER_01]: when I started losing weight, like I was a
hundred or so pounds heavier than I am
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then I would drink a lot of soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was drinking like six liters a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most days on tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, see the thing you wake up and be
like, you have a large, like I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: large you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have two large sodas at breakfast
because I get a refill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at lunch and then backstage there's
always free soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the show we get some pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was, it was pretty,
pretty severe, but yeah, try cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: got off all that stuff and went off the
anti-anxiety pills against my doctor's
[SPEAKER_01]: orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I started losing the weight,
she's like, okay, I'll sign your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your forms for you to get into a
compassion club.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point in Toronto, there were
two compassion clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, one was pretty strict and you know,
like you had to be signed in by a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one, if you knew the right
people, I think you'd get around the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor thing, but this was definitely one
of the ones that you needed your doctor to
[SPEAKER_01]: really sign off for you at, and by that
point I'd already made some connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had other hookups to get it from,
but the compassion club was great because
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of gave me exposure to like a
whole new side of cannabis back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, it, it, it's so recent time wise,
but it was just such a different world,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like pre medical pre legalization was like
a secret society back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what, what initially pushed you like
from trying cannabis and LSD and shit like
[SPEAKER_03]: that to going straight edge?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, was it just the punk scene,
the type of music you were listening to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's also what prevented me from
admitting that I liked pro wrestling for
[SPEAKER_01]: so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would kind of watch it in secret
because I hated the kids at my school that
[SPEAKER_01]: were into wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just felt like, and I also,
it was like my parents both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoked weed the whole time off and on with
my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't really smoke weed now at all,
but my, my mom secretly smoked weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: she was like, I tried it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never tried it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I found like a real rebellion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my dad was like really freaked out by
straight edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that being a little rebellious
too, like from the future kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think it was the dogma of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the fact that like,
why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like normally when someone decides to be
sober, it's because they've got a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: or because their religion tells them,
or, you know, to say like, I'm just doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it because I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to be kind of aggressive with it,
like, like Xing up before I went to his
[SPEAKER_01]: wedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like things that like, you know,
just obviously are attention getting you
[SPEAKER_01]: realize as you're older, but at the time
it just is like, this is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did really make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I was straight edge when I was
straight edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I came back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like swing plate rigs had just kind of hit
and extracts and concentrates were just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously the medical wave was just
about to really start hitting in Americans
[SPEAKER_01]: or in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It already kind of started, I guess in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even though I recently read that we
actually had medical cannabis in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: first, but it was just such a shitty
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: That that's probably right too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stunted it for a long time up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I guess we had such great
bud out in BC is because everyone had
[SPEAKER_01]: these really great doctors that were
signing them into this medical program
[SPEAKER_01]: that was really hard to get signed into
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like, so I'm glad I was
certainly I wouldn't take back being
[SPEAKER_01]: straight edge at all, but I'm glad I got
in the weed one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did, because it was just in time to
kind of see the roaring twenties of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis just before, you know,
legalization changed everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily in the most positive ways
all the time, but changed everything
[SPEAKER_01]: nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even being like straight edge or
identifying the straight edge,
[SPEAKER_03]: you were still in a band with people that
like use pot, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't like super dogmatic,
like no minor threat era.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a really hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in Toronto being dogmatic about
that stuff, not just in the punk scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just thinking in general,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just, it's a big city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that kind of like straight
edge militancy probably works when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in a very small town or very, you know,
where you can kind of control things a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like it was never, you know,
I always had friends that smoked and drank
[SPEAKER_01]: and I kind of loved being around people
that smoke and drank and never really had
[SPEAKER_01]: a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In sort of outside myself kind of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think now in retrospect,
I probably wouldn't have had a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with it myself if I had been doing it back
then, but I just, you know, it was a good
[SPEAKER_01]: time for me not to be doing it,
looking at some of my friends and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sort of paths they went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pre the cocaine revival and pre
all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, still, there was still obviously
lots of wildness being had in the late
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a big like a heroin surge up
there in Canada for the punk scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, it's kind of been here the
whole way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had, there's a band from up
here called the bunch of fucking goofs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You told me about them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, they're our band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like the legendary band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every scene kind of has the band
that never got out of the scene
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you ask anyone that's around that
scene, like who the most important band
[SPEAKER_01]: is, the BFGs came out, I guess,
84, 83 and really into the late,
[SPEAKER_01]: late nineties, early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were still pretty strong when they
were going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they police the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had Fort goof was, was their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talk to bands that came through
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have stories about going to Fort
goof.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jerry A tells a story about having
like some crazy open wound from the stage
[SPEAKER_01]: on his leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some dog licking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then being like, no, no, no,
don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogs mouths are disinfectants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry's like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You think?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a crazy infection the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, but they, because they
police the scene, their big stances were
[SPEAKER_01]: no hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no crack, no heroin and no Nazis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, there, there obviously
were these things in and around Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just didn't really see it around
the punk scene major.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with the arrival, I guess of oxy
and then fentanyl that changed everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really did start from death,
start happening in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and these had happened before,
but I think for our scene, it was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: new when, when fentanyl really started
hitting or oxys before that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really did make it hardcore available
for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always just wondered like with,
with heroin, how it worked, like up in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada, like actual trade of it and how it
moved its way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it made like, like the Mexican black
tar made it up that way and fucked the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole scenes up and, and killed it off or
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it definitely happens here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is definitely like a pipeline that's
established between out West out West is
[SPEAKER_01]: a, is heroin on like into Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll tell you, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That opioids have, uh, really wreak havoc
on the population in that city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you really, you see that begin in
the punk scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people have on turn it upon outed
certain people as being the, the conduits
[SPEAKER_01]: for heroin arriving in the punk scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a, there was a pipeline kind
of established.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this guy for the more for,
for weed, but there was this guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Rosie, who's the, the hash King of,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was bringing in tons and tons of hash
and he got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was put on trial with Neil Young's
brother and Norman Mailer testified in
[SPEAKER_01]: their defense the day after he like one or
presented an Oscar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got like eight years for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Rosie's story is wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he, but he went out West and met the
guys out West, which was a lot of dudes in
[SPEAKER_01]: bike clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a lot of guys that come out from the
States during the Vietnam war and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there've been a lot of seeds and
genetics that have come up through Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rosie kind of brought the hash across
and they had the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was sort of the exchange for a
while, but there was stuff coming up from
[SPEAKER_01]: like Jamaican sess trying on a rather
large Jamaican population or people from
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and around that time, there's a lot of
sess around here, but people talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: how great the hash was in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Rosie got busted the second time
he gets out of prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: That first time they got busted with Neil
Young's brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets interviewed by some reporter
from Rolling Stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reporter's like, let's get the
band back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they start smuggling hash and I'll be
in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tempting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were bringing in tons and tons of
hash and eventually, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the law caught onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's this whole wild story
about tons of hash being brought into New
[SPEAKER_01]: York and them letting the sale go,
the CIA or something letting the sale go
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like deep, I'm probably messing up all the
details of it, but anyway, he gets busted
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time when Rose is on trial,
he gets Neil Young to testify as defense
[SPEAKER_01]: famous or like with his brother before,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the little connection and Neil
looks around the room and he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke weed every day and I earn more
money than all you put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they gave Rosie like 28 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Neil Young didn't like pulling favors
for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the celebrity name drop you don't
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds like a circus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring in Neil Young just cause we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rosie was definitely like the,
the link for a lot of that stuff going out
[SPEAKER_01]: West.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of that sort of
connection between out West and out,
[SPEAKER_01]: out here going back to, you know,
the seventies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I do want to talk about like
early on is the new video, obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: because there, there, there really isn't
to me, like anything covering cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: history in any meaningful way in music
like that currently, especially not in
[SPEAKER_03]: punk rock or hardcore or any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not, it's not a normal thing to
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something I wanted to bring up
and, and, and make sure everybody gets to
[SPEAKER_03]: see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think we mentioned your
fucking band yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I kind of just rolled in hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just consume or no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can duck off if you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're fine, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They only get mad about like showing
plants for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had some to show off,
but I know, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a post product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The video was, was a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again, publicly for your help on
this, because it's something I wanted to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just, I'm fascinated by
history of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I kind of get into something,
I want to really kind of get into it and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with cannabis, there's just so
many false paths that you can wind up
[SPEAKER_01]: going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just so much false information
that's out there that digging in and
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to people that know about the
plant that I've experienced with the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's not like not to put you
over on your own ship, but like someone
[SPEAKER_01]: like yourself who's actually like putting
the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, it's like kind of invaluable
because it's not really something you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many books that you can't
pick up that are full of disinformation
[SPEAKER_01]: and misinformation and, and to kind of
like put all those pieces together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you really do rely on people that
have been kind of putting this puzzle
[SPEAKER_01]: together before you to kind of help you
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like it's just trying to pay
tribute to this amazing plant that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: had a relationship with now for like,
I guess, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really intensely, but has been
around for millennia and has been involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in the human experience for millennia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when it's not being vilified,
I think it's being misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every time I buy cannabis,
I get asked Indica or Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's an icebreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the idea that this plant knows,
although this plant, like as it's growing
[SPEAKER_01]: is, okay, I got to make sure I present
this trait of myself that makes this
[SPEAKER_01]: person want to watch Netflix and eat ice
cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in nature that would make
a plant want to do that to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is this person thinking that that's
going to have, or trying to tell me that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to have that kind of effect on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, it feels like there's a lot of
silliness around cannabis and not that our
[SPEAKER_01]: videos not silly in its own way,
but I wanted like in amongst the silliness
[SPEAKER_01]: to have some like actual real information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: About it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was like the inspiration for doing
it right now versus even 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: fucked up with let me like the band
finally all kind of just signed off on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The band signed off on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we have on our last record,
we have a song called Lords of Kensington,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is about this neighborhood in
Toronto called Kensington market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which at one point was a, a market kind of
area for recently arrived people from
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people recently arrived from
China and Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just sort of in the nineties,
it became a place with lots of thrift
[SPEAKER_01]: stores and still lots of food markets and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a, a cool neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a bunch of neat little venues
in there, like who's Emma or the anarchist
[SPEAKER_01]: free space where you could kind of just
put on shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the basement and buy records or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the song is kind of reflecting on that
neighborhood and the changes in that
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that there was this park in
this neighborhood that's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that park was where kids would always
go and just smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of people selling weed
and then cops got wise to it and would go
[SPEAKER_01]: down and fake sell weed to kids and try to
get kids and fuck up kids lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in one of the kind of the
grossest displays of post-legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in Canada, this, the former
police chief of Toronto, Julian Fantino,
[SPEAKER_01]: who indirectly, probably directly to drink
his time as a cop is responsible for like
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of lives being fucked up by
cannabis laws, uh, putting out like an
[SPEAKER_01]: editorial about how he had changed his
mind about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, go figure when there's money on
the table, I've changed his mind about
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And opened a weed store in Kensington
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wrote a song on the last record
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, on this record, it's kind of like
a fantasy about a kid who had been
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested by a cop going down and watching
the cops weed store grow to business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and so I, with the song being so
directly about cannabis and me
[SPEAKER_01]: unrelentingly, uh, kind of assing fucked
up for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do something about weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: They finally were like, all right,
do your fucking way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jonah from fucked up really kind of
carried it for me because as you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from dealing with me, man, I'm a little
disorganized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a nice dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoyed meeting him.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very talented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the, uh, like, uh, he could do
anyone's job in fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like fucked up could function completely
well, just with him as a one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the bands he in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Career suicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, he did a band called mad men for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an amazing kind of hardcore band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he played drums as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not forgetting something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He played drums and now he does Jade
hairpins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he also does a band called boss with a
bunch of guys, like guys from Rick's and
[SPEAKER_01]: guys from, uh, chubby and the gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like an international pub
rock kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then he produced a lot of records.
[SPEAKER_01]: He produced that last Lex on fire record.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big record up here and he's,
yeah, he's super talented.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's definitely the best member of our
band by far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has he been in it since the beginning?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like all the members always been in
the band or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the last one to join.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did four shows with, uh, Josh as the
singer, the guy who plays guitar in the
[SPEAKER_01]: band now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he went to train hop,
uh, down in the U S so punk rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty September 11th when you
could still kind of train hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so he trade hop down there in the
States and they had three shows lined up
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were like, do you want to sing
these three shows?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sang them and we had fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when Josh came back, uh,
Mike from fucked up was like, you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to learn guitar and Jamie's going to
be the singer now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's kind of been weirdly
ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any of us, I think every
stage of fucked up has felt like the last.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think anyone in the band
thought it would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many years has the band been running?
[SPEAKER_03]: 24.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so long, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people to get along enough to be in a
van and we don't get along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we don't get along at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's funny when we were like,
I remember one of the first big festivals
[SPEAKER_01]: we played was tea in the park in,
in Edinburgh and, uh, raging with the
[SPEAKER_01]: machine showed up in each one was in a
separate sprinter van.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, Oh my God, like how bad
does it have to be that you can't even sit
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same van as the rest of the people
in your band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that we have the means for it in
fucked up, but if we did have the means,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we would all be in separate
sprinter vans.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's, let's talk about, um,
your vice era.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that you did with vice,
uh, specifically for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: also with the wrestlers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's like something I was
fascinated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, um, yeah, it was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how did that even come to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you want to be like, you want the
whole vice saga from beginning to end?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe let me do, let me do my,
uh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad first and then I get really into it
because this is like, uh, like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the history of vice, when you,
when you really start breaking it,
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend was like, whatever you do,
don't show your smoking setup on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast because it's like the bummiest
smoking setup anyone's ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cannabis is such a heady world
where everyone's like, Oh, you got to have
[SPEAKER_01]: heady shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I like basically am one step above
smoking out of a tin can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have, you don't have a bunch of
trap trophies still.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some glass pieces, but they have
all been broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my one, I'll show my one rig in a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my like my one cool piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got a good story attached to
vice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you edit or is this all live?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't, I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use a thermometer when you're
dabbing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no, I always just ended up using a
puffco because I'm way too lazy to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend got my friend gave me his old
thermometer and it changed the way I dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you know, you're supposed to be a
certain temperature and not just nail that
[SPEAKER_03]: bitch hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I realized that every dab I had taken
before had been way too hot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, uh, I played in a band when I was
in grade nine and 10 called you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first show the second show we ever
played afterwards, we went to a restaurant
[SPEAKER_01]: that was open super late and walking in,
they would have all like the free
[SPEAKER_01]: newspapers and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Toronto being a big city, we had a lot
of free weeklies and other papers back
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw this one with a Frank Kozak
picture on the cover of a dog with a
[SPEAKER_01]: machine gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Kozak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a huge, absolutely rest in
peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone who I think, yeah, we could do a
whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I was like, oh my God, Frank Kozak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had an article though,
propaganda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember in that issue and something
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was called voice back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I picked it up and I'm like,
this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it became vice really shortly
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was still like a newsprint thing
that you'd pick up and had the do's and
[SPEAKER_01]: don'ts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was talking about garage rock in
Montreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, they kept talking about this
record label.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were starting back then called SSG
records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were going to be putting out all
these records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just seemed right even then super
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was talking about punk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was talking about rap music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had cool comics in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, and it was really well written.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was just something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just kind of like, I picked it up
every month after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just something you,
you grabbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like, you go to the record store and
they're like, oh, the new issue of vice is
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one that's got like a Len flexi
in it with his mark, the Bismarck key song
[SPEAKER_01]: that they did with Len that came in one
issue of vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just part of like my youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we start fucked up like years
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get weirdly out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day we get an email from a guy named
Andy Capper, who was the editor of vice UK
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, a friend of mine told me
about your band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys, I like your band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I want to do something with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Mike from fucked up was like,
you should put out a seven inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you put a seven inch on vice
records?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did, but didn't clear it with the
rest of vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a bootleg vice records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the same time, Artie Philly,
who played in a bunch of great hardcore
[SPEAKER_01]: bands over the years was, who was a writer
for vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the thing about vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right from the get-go, there was tons
of punk and hardcore people writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For it or involved in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you kind of always knew people
that knew people that were in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or this guy from this band's now writing
for them or the guy from the space does
[SPEAKER_01]: these reviews or, you know, like all stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Artie Philly, who was writing for
them at the time and played in all these
[SPEAKER_01]: hardcore bands hit us in career suicide up
and was like, can I interview you guys for
[SPEAKER_01]: vice?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we both sent our, you know,
answers back to the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, can you guys send some
photos and Martin from career suicide,
[SPEAKER_01]: never sent photos, but I had some photos
that a friend of mine had taken of me
[SPEAKER_03]: bleeding from the head legendary photos
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was the thing, you know,
like that was the vice went with that
[SPEAKER_01]: photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, I think what made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably that photo in vice
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, they wanted to sign
us and we didn't sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up signing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from back then, I had no idea who
Martin was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had no idea like I was like,
This is going to last a long time,
but I'm going to have to write in English
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, this is going to last,
you know.
It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember it was just like so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember I remember it was like,
oh, I'm going to have to write in English.
I'm going to have to write in English.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, I'm going to have to
write in English.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other guy's like, are you serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, so much of a tradition
to be burned in English.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would leave and he would
continue to think in English.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada was kind of part of the company,
but like the kinder, gentler version of
[SPEAKER_01]: vice like the Canadian version.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is weird because vice is ultimately
started by a bunch of assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Canada, but, but still the vice
office in Toronto was definitely like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian version of vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everyone was a lot friendlier and a
lot kinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you look at the content
that they put out, a lot of it was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of it had a lot more heart than a lot
of the US stuff that was coming around at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that time it was still just like a
fledgling operation up here in the Toronto
[SPEAKER_01]: office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they had just started opening these
satellite offices and the Toronto office
[SPEAKER_01]: was pretty new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came to me and they were like,
we want to do a thing about Budweiser,
[SPEAKER_01]: a thing about bands where you go around
and interview bands and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsored by Budweiser beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had briefly been a DJ on much music,
which is the Canadian MTV and just spent
[SPEAKER_01]: the last two years interviewing terrible
bands about music.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being sponsored by Budweiser was weird
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also just don't want to interview
bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, we're looking to
do a medical cannabis documentary too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got medical weed and we went out to
BC and shot the Canadian cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: documentary, the very first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did really well for vice Canada on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when vice YouTube channel was
still really popping or just starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: really pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ended up doing another four more
of these documentaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The experiences were really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met some great friends that I'm still
super tight with today and friends for
[SPEAKER_01]: life making these documentaries and really
got to kind of see like the real side of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that we see where, and I'm sure
it's still huge, the stuff, but that would
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like kind of the crest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it felt like the roaring twenties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was just 200 plus dispensaries
in downtown Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like five times more
dispensaries than Tim Hortons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've said in one of the
documentaries, some, some crazy number of
[SPEAKER_01]: these dispensaries and every one of these
dispensaries had a lounge upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: With where people would just go and do
dabs and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them were packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them look like they were turning a
profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it really did feel like, shit,
this is what it should be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's weird how post legalization that
hasn't come back in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, there is obviously tons of
money being made by some people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry, but it seems to be like
a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't the case back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I'm glad I got to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, and I, and I really did realize it
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember the day legalization
happened sitting there with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: friends having to sash being like,
I think this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we saw the best shit that happened
in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they'd already written, the cops had
already rated all the dispensaries by that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could already tell that there was
a change coming that was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was, I thought it was
going to be as severe as it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, and vice by that point, it already
kind of transitioned into making the
[SPEAKER_01]: wrestling content by the time legalization
hit, but they were already like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had so much goodwill with people on the
traditional, the traditional side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: market or the legacy market, I should say,
that they just kind of eroded immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made a deal with a canopy to do some
branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started to make some really cool
stuff, which I think is when you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: a content and everyone was bummed out
naturally, I remember watching the first
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of content they made and it was not,
it was like an ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a documentary and then it cuts
to the end and cause they weren't allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to show people consuming in advertorial
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that she's clearly rolling
up like a cigarette they cut away from
[SPEAKER_01]: before she's like puts it in her mouth to
kind of be like, well, And yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was great though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bunch of times they tried to
get rid of me and bring in a younger
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what vice was ultimately,
you know, running on the blood of the
[SPEAKER_01]: youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd bring in these younger
reporters and there might be better
[SPEAKER_01]: reporters than me, but by God,
did they not have the tolerance?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one by one, they would all just
fall as they'd have to go to these
[SPEAKER_01]: sessions with glass blowers or growers or
genetics people, or just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people that can smoke and they
would be under the table passed out and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd have to call me grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my one natural ability that kept
me employed advice for so long was my
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one, another big thing that
happened was vice had their like 20th
[SPEAKER_01]: anniversary party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, was it 20th?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it was 20th and they flew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, Hey, uh, the service from
vice hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, do you want to come to New York
and play at our 20th party?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is before I started making
documentaries for him or any of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the beginning of the kind of
thought the cold war.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I was like, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, okay, you're going to be
doing a thing with Nick from the AES and
[SPEAKER_01]: we want you to do a couple of punk songs
and just come down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I flew down in New York, talked to Nick
and Nick's like, dude, I'm overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got me doing like 50 songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just figure out doing like the
hardcore set with, you know, a band
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put together a band with Ben from
Dillinger escape plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, uh, what's his name on drums?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soft circle is his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm flanking on his name right now,
but on drums and then Steven McDonald from
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Cross on bass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did, we did a bunch of our worst
songs in this vice party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was, it was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the day little Wayne had left cash
money and little Wayne was performing
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's all this crazy security.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, is baby going to show up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is she going to go off?
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finished him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started doing, we do this hardcore set
and then I finished and then I look over
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's spike Jones on bass or
keyboards and Jonah Hill covering like
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin's room on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that acid trip, but kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was, and, but after that they gave
me a vice ring and I got it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was like, have you ever seen that
Seinfeld episode where Kramer gets the
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony somehow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this ring was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I all of a sudden had this ring and
it was like, I was in the masons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I never had to sign in for security
advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because no one really
understood what the ring was in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the satellite office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they thought it just meant maybe
executive or yeah, you're locked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of shit that they were just
like, he's got a ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never had to sign in at security.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many weird things happen, but just
because, you know, I Kramer this Tony
[SPEAKER_01]: ring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you get pulled over by cops in
the U S do you just put your hand up with
[SPEAKER_03]: the ring?
[SPEAKER_03]: No ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they cut your finger off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at one point Gavin, well actually,
yeah, when we first, we did that very
[SPEAKER_01]: first cannabis documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me so I had so much weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I'm leaving the hotel room and I'm
like literally just like eating hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, just like chewing raw hash,
chewing edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I show up at the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it must've been like, like pouring out
of my pores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I must've been sweating Phoenix
tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get to the border the first,
cause you have to pre-clear customs at
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver and Toronto airport before you
know, the States and immigration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to immigration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy's like, takes a whiff of me and
he's like, go to, go to secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go into the secondary inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy gets my bag and he's like,
uh, are you bringing weed with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, he's like, dude,
you smell like a marijuana grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I'm going to go shoot a
music video with my band and play a show
[SPEAKER_01]: in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just making a documentary here
in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's like, what's the documentary
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it's a documentary for vice
about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, will it be on the YouTube
channel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, oh my God, man, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zips up my bag, passes it back to me,
just escorts me right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Hey man, I look forward to
seeing that documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you got the ring free ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I did have my ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I had it on me though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just very bizarre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the power that thing had for a hot
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess we're seeing it now with Drake
too, like how quickly culture can change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, when we started making that
wrestling TV show till the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: like at the beginning, vice was a sacred
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could, you know, you just utter vice
and people are willing to help you out in
[SPEAKER_01]: any way they could.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we were finished where it was
like, Oh, I fucking hate vice or I used to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch vice and it's like eight months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So was the wrestling show as big as the
weed show?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as far as views and shit,
it's kind of hard to say, like I still
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even really know like the way it
went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So vice Canada had this huge $500 million
deal from Rogers, which is the big cable
[SPEAKER_01]: provider here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a certain point Rogers just wrote
off the investment and said, you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: keep, keep the money that we've paid you
so far and keep all your content.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want it, which I really think was
the beginning of the dominoes falling for
[SPEAKER_01]: vice in terms of business deals,
being to go south and everything kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were part of that Rogers deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were one of the last shows they
greenlit under that Rogers deal where they
[SPEAKER_01]: had money to kind of spend on these kind
of TV shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a decent budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see a lot of that decent budget,
making that show solid, decent budget,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we got to spend a lot of money making
that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's crazy looking back on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's why we were able to travel
to all those places that we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: travel and do all these, those sorts of
things was because this Rogers deal,
[SPEAKER_01]: which then evaporated in the process of
making that show, which left our show kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of in limbo vice had changed directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice also never really believed in,
in wrestling, which is interesting now
[SPEAKER_01]: with the success they've had with dark
side of the ring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of, and they were in production
just after we went into production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also started in Canada,
their production too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but so on advice, like an executive
straight up told me, like, no one cares
[SPEAKER_01]: about wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, there's millions of people
watching it every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly there's one of their biggest
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then dark side of the ring became
their biggest show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was these Samaro, Maddie Mattson,
and, uh, and that I think are their big
[SPEAKER_01]: success stories of kind of the vice TV
experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did the therapist show come in
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was when we were making the
wrestling show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that came about because Andy Capper
was like, Hey, I'm doing this show where
[SPEAKER_01]: you just come in and talk to this
therapist guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, okay, well, how bad could
that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on tour and he's like, yeah,
we'll pay you like 500 bucks for the two
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, can I smoke weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, which I don't think is, I don't think
you're allowed to give therapy to someone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's, uh, not that I would ever not be
high on weed, but like, I think on an
[SPEAKER_01]: ethics level, the fact that this therapist
knew that might be a weird conflict,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was very fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is so intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was an intense show, even
watching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom made me cut out a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an early cut of it and I sent it to
my mom and she's like, you cut out all
[SPEAKER_01]: this shit about your stepfather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they really dialed that side of it
back, but they got me to say shit on the
[SPEAKER_01]: record that I never want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember the day it aired,
I was in the Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filming in Kinshasa, filming the episode
of the wrestlers in the, in the democratic
[SPEAKER_01]: public Congo and sitting in the hotel
room, the internet's, I can't stream it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know it's airing and just being like
having the most intense day in Kinshasa
[SPEAKER_01]: filming where every day filming that
episode was, was pretty intense,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sitting in that room and just being
like, fuck, I have this goddamn therapy
[SPEAKER_01]: show airing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a panic attack in itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's so many panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day of that experience was a panic
attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was the best year of my life
making that show in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: like professional year of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every day was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day was, was cool, but the amount of
travel was very intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gone for two weeks every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes it would be like a
month in Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it was like, yeah, it's a month
in Japan, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: No weed, but, Oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a couple of opportunities to smoke,
but I'm like, I don't think I'd enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of mids they got in Japan back
then you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously I'm talking to a guy when
for most people, you can get Cali quality
[SPEAKER_01]: weed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, obviously shop shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say for the rest of the
world, like top gear weed, but it was at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time I was told $80 a gram,
$9 a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Thailand, Thailand legalization
looks so attractive to tourists because
[SPEAKER_01]: people are coming from Russia and Japan
where to pay for that California stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're paying, you know,
$90 a gram, $80 a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to pay $40 a gram doesn't seem that
bad.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, yeah, it was too rich for my blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just stayed away from weed the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually that year I smoked weed in Mexico
a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I smoked weed in Bolivia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it was, it was not the greatest
cannabis in my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coca leaves though were wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely have never, never been an
upper person, but, uh, chewing a bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: coca leaves really helped me deal with the
altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, but yeah, I'm trying to think of
other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there would be, cause wrestlers,
a lot of wrestlers smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're around the wrestlers,
there's always cannabis kind of around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it was, it was, uh,
it was an intense year, but an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like so much shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just obviously like getting to see
some of these places realizing like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis and wrestling are the
same in this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cross social lines in the way that
punk never really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you'll see cannabis and
wrestling in places that have no punk
[SPEAKER_01]: scene or maybe a very tiny punk scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there was, uh, it was really
cool to kind of like think about this for
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrestling show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically it was this sort of idea that
wrestling everywhere it goes, it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be like a type of music and it's going
to adapt the local culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why Lucha Libre and Japanese
strong style have very little physical
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese incredibly in common with each
other and their, their performance of
[SPEAKER_01]: professional wrestling or the,
the execution of professional wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it's a language that
you can stick these two guys in the ring
[SPEAKER_01]: together or two people in the ring
together, and they'd still be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how to have a match with each
other and getting to see that pour out,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the people in Bolivia or the people
in T stabilizing and the people in none of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone kind of spoke the same
language of, of pro wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm a, I'm a big mark for like New
Japan pro wrestling, like all that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like but mostly because of how it
intertwined with MMA in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and you'd find these people doing
these, you know, choreographed acts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, a year later,
they're in real fights, real submission
[SPEAKER_03]: fights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as tough as anyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the UWFI and pancreas and sort of
that and Big Japan and in all Japan and in
[SPEAKER_01]: New Japan as well, like the way the like,
I think it's Terry Funk described it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast thing he did with Cole Cabana
where like, wrestling, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look at the history of professional
wrestling in Japan, it's there prior to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Second World War.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think it was brought over by masons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was sort of like just part of like,
gambling culture, like the idea of like
[SPEAKER_01]: fixing wrestling matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the performance of wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not until after the Second World
War and Ricky Dozan, this former sumo
[SPEAKER_01]: wrestler who, according to what I've read,
couldn't arise past a certain rank in sumo
[SPEAKER_01]: because he was part Korean or had a Korean
mother, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of hit a ceiling in sumo,
came over to wrestling and Japan sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: freshly removed from the Second World War.
[SPEAKER_01]: He realized what people wanted to see in
Japan was Japanese people fighting
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started bringing in these
American guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they're one generation removed
from armed conflict.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times these guys would get in the
ring and they just tried and kill each
[SPEAKER_01]: other and Terry, Terry, Terry Funk's like,
in America, you're trying to make a work
[SPEAKER_01]: look like a shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Japan, you're trying to make a shoot
look like a work because we'd go out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and fucking kill each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's it's funny how that became
the style, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To this day, that's the strong style is
and that's why Japanese wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I love, too, is because
like these guys are going in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: there are people are going in there and
just being the shit out of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very physical and it's very snug
and and very like and then at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: point, I guess people were just like,
Yeah, what if we fought for real?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, we really just like,
didn't bother, you know, deciding who was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to win in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, what that brings and if you look
at like a lot of the early, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: even UFC guys, a lot of them had
experience or training in Japanese pro
[SPEAKER_04]: wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably why a lot of them were
able to kind of, you know, become the
[SPEAKER_01]: stars they were because they knew what
people want to see in the ring and they
[SPEAKER_01]: knew what they the fans needed from their
physical combat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also had the charisma.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a big part of selling yourself
in any fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was yeah, it was interesting and kind
of like going around and realizing that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like sort of this universal
quality to people that wind up being pro
[SPEAKER_01]: wrestlers, like not every not say that
everyone's the exact same, but there's and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's a universal quality of people
who wind up being wrestling fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not necessarily the same types
of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was interesting because it's
closer to cannabis in this way that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: a secret thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for different reasons, I guess maybe
way back when when it was still being
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed in terms of gambling stuff,
it was for kind of the same reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep it secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you really don't like the fans in
wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like punk where it's like,
hey, you kid, come up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can do this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, hey, you kid, come in the ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking dare you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to break your arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing I learned very quickly is
never let a wrestler demonstrate a move on
[SPEAKER_01]: you or demonstrate something on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew this going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing I made prior to the
wrestlers, because Bryce kept being like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, you can't make anything about
wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one cares about wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did this documentary about
death match wrestling with this director,
[SPEAKER_01]: Shawnee, who was an amazing director.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went down to the terminal of death
in Delaware.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know about this thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No tournament of death is this annual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they're still doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrestling event put on by CZW on the
owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the CZW one.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: D.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hyde's parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went out there and we filmed and it
was it was nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept selling it to vice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been I've been trying to make this
documentary with them for years on this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you will not believe how crazy
this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought it back and they just could not
believe how out of control all the
[SPEAKER_01]: violence in this thing was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first thing that sold
them because it did so well on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and finally kind of like made them
realize that people actually care about
[SPEAKER_01]: wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have nightmares.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was definitely the wildest shoot ever
and the most insane people to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember seeing that episode or that
that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nuts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was we did that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we did another one for the series on
on death match wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a kind of a separate culture than
even any other pro wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's kind of merged because A.W.
[SPEAKER_01]: puts death match wrestling on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was so maligned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you talk to even today,
when I talk to some of the guys that are
[SPEAKER_01]: WWE wrestlers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be like, oh, I hate that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of like tattoos and
scratches, you know, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like or like I was telling my friend,
I'm like, yeah, you got to look at what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like Iron Maiden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're doing is is psychosin or
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like napalm death, maybe even where
it's it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's but it's it's valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people that that like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I just it's definitely extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's weird to watch because you
know, this person is going to suffer for
[SPEAKER_01]: this afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like permanently, permanently,
like every single person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single person needs medical
attention after wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the the compensation for the level of
suffering is completely out of whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just yeah, that was it was fascinating for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still fascinated by what motivates
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got a lot of friends that that
are those kinds of wrestlers or do that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it is such a weird subsect of a
already strange culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you think that came in to
inspire what you didn't fucked up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the blading and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when we first started playing
shows, I would like hit myself with a
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone and try and bust myself open
the hard way like Wesley Willis does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sound guys fucking hated you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bled very little, had massive bruising
and severe headaches afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was working at a video store at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this guy, Glenn Salter,
legendary Toronto zine maker and played
[SPEAKER_01]: guitar in a bunch of cool bands too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had this crazy VHS tape collection
of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of wrestling stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, how do they bleed like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are they doing to get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, ah, they, they take aspirin and
have themselves the razor blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, now it's also so quaintly
you just type in how do they bleed on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that point, it was like,
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, they take a little blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like pointing women.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't remember the first time I did
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it bled like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it bleeds like anytime you see
anything of me and I'm just covered in
[SPEAKER_01]: blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, there's that MTV Canada
performance where just sheets of blood are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming off my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think I also kind of tried it's
weird because they're almost hardcore,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically is almost antithetical to
like, wrestling, because wrestling is a
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation of a character and sort of
the manipulation of reality, manipulation
[SPEAKER_01]: of reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas I think hardcore is about trying
to obviously manipulate reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're, you're definitely not
presenting fact, but you're trying to be
[SPEAKER_01]: as real as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also authentically yourself as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're singing about your own life and
you're trying to present yourself as a
[SPEAKER_01]: real person on stage, lest you be the
Misfits or yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and that's, that's kind of like what
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think during the songs, wrestling
definitely influences it, but in between
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like almost the resistance to be a
guy up there cutting promos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to be as like real as possible
in between the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like, some Danzig-esque
character that I'm playing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want more?
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been excellent though,
to see that version of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I have it in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me enough time on the road.
