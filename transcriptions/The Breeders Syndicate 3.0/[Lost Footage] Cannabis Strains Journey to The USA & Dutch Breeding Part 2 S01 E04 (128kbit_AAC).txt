[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's really good questions right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I think we're live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breed or Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here with our other host, Natzo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even like calling you a co-host,
because you're really just the other host.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other host, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, we're going to cover cannabis
breeding as it was back in the Dutch era,
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly, and pre-Dutch era, and a little
bit after and why it matters today,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we apply that to what we're
working with today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to start with that, we're going to
have to go over some very basic breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology, just so you can understand
when we move on, move forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the people who haven't quite
gotten there yet can understand what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, let's kick it off, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll kick it off with just to go over
what Matt said again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to take you through
some early days of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of up to what we've already done so
far, which is like the 80s Holland era,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll move forward onto different
stuff later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as terms go, probably one of
the more misused terms is F1, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with F1, because this has a lot
of... This is used incorrectly in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis world daily, even by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, there's not really another
term to switch it out with as we use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sadly, there's almost no F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being is that what an F1
means is when you take two parents that
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty much true breeding and you
cross them together, that would result in
[SPEAKER_00]: what was called an F1, where basically all
the dominant genes from both parents will
[SPEAKER_00]: be dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll get what's called hybrid
vigor, because you're not going to get any
[SPEAKER_00]: weird recessives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically end up with whatever the
dominant genes are in both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, an example of that,
for instance, would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: say something like, you know, for our
purposes, like skunk one by Hades or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, like or or skunk one
by an NL or something, something along
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason why they use skunk one
so much was simply because it was it was
[SPEAKER_00]: an easy way to F1 something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even even technically, you want to
get more basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing F1s, it's like Afghani
crossed a tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it has to be the definition is to
crossing two parental lines with
[SPEAKER_02]: distinctively different genotypes,
the most importantly, which makes it more
[SPEAKER_00]: rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of the most incorrect terms
because a lot of times it's used just to
[SPEAKER_00]: say this is the first time someone's
crossed these two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my kushments by Skittles F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that and that and that's not right,
because those aren't like parental stock
[SPEAKER_00]: from a region of origin, you know,
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So F2 would be if you take that F1 seed
and you grow up males and females and you
[SPEAKER_00]: cross them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when with a line you should see all
of the dominance, all the recessive,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the various permutations of what's in
that line can pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of getting like all the
dominant traits combined, you get every
[SPEAKER_00]: trait imaginable combining in every way
imaginable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly, you'll see stuff
that you would not see in the F1 line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff cannot show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are things that will never show up
in the F1 line that will only show up F2
[SPEAKER_02]: and F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give it to give a really easy example
for people like in humans, brown eyes is a
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to have blue eyes,
gray eyes, green eyes, hazel eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: both parents have to have that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to line up to two
recessives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one parent doesn't have the gene,
it'll never pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so that's that's F1,
F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: S1 is a relatively modern thing in terms
of people being able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's basically it's a self one
either through hermaphrodism naturally or
[SPEAKER_00]: something human induced from some kind of
spray that's used in modern terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You S1 the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be sort of frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in in recent years, because we have a
lot of cuts that we don't have the line
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, we just have the specific cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the only way to look through
genetics in that line besides,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, besides an outcross or a hybrid
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as good as as doing because
you get a lot of weirdness when you
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get some undesirable things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the very least, it gives you an
idea to, like, look through something like
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D or, you know, Trinity or,
you know, something that's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an elite clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a thing called and also
in adding on to it was looked down on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only looked down on in the cannabis
sphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: In normal agriculture, selfing is the
normal way to breed uniform crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't use filial generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go through selfing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's so it was a cannabis kind of old
wives tale, as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the one of the things that
happens with cannabis, too, is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in modern agriculture,
when you're developing a seed line,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want a whole bunch of like
butter lettuce, for instance, that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out extremely similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might want a bunch of seeds of
whatever cucumbers or zucchini or what
[SPEAKER_00]: have you that comes out extremely
dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they will ask one that until they
get, you know, a very dependable,
[SPEAKER_00]: very narrow breeding uniform uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, you know, that's part of the reason
why, like, you know, and so IBL,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we'll shift this segues into it
because IBL is another like super misused
[SPEAKER_00]: terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it stands essentially for inbred line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me add this in, because this is the
point where most people lose it because it
[SPEAKER_02]: says inbred line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not mean that if you line breed
that you have an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very specific term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a basically don't look at it
like, OK, well, I crossed this F1 made
[SPEAKER_02]: F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's line bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inbred line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically what it means is uniformity
in a line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that can always be
achieved at F6 or F8.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only means when you're popping those
seeds, you have a homogenous line,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning uniform like clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, you know, for like large scale
agriculture, something like that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that useful for the most part,
unless you get something amazing because
[SPEAKER_00]: what you see is what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you breed with an IBL, it'll throw what
you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very valuable in hemp farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that that's one place where they're
liking seeing uniformity in self blinds
[SPEAKER_02]: because they just it's more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can pop all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they come out uniform, that's even
more that it takes the cloning out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: picture and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in hemp, I can see that being more
useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in modern cannabis, people want to
find that that keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they want they want a little bit of
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's new paths for a breeder,
for somebody like, you know, for a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting something where like there's
nowhere to go within the gene pool itself
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's an IBL and it already is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traits you see are the traits you get
unless you really want to add those traits
[SPEAKER_00]: to another line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, there's not a lot of room
for places to go because it's already been
[SPEAKER_00]: all that variety has been bred out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing with breeding,
where it's like a lot of breeding depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on what your goals are.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some things on goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might want consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might want like the same three
to six phenols to regularly pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might want to breed an IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might want to do an open
pollination or an F2 and have the widest
[SPEAKER_00]: possible gene pool to hunt through,
depending on what your what your goals
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to find like a random elite
cutting to hold on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trying to actually breed a line
like Matt was saying where you could like
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a hemp field and start thousands
of seeds and get the same consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, size bush type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have IX, Incross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incross is the last one we have left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Incross is the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another weird term because we
call it a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most other breeding, they call it a
BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: A back cross is actually like the
technical term that you would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for for most cannabis people,
they're mostly familiar with a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a BX is simply you take a cut,
you know, and you use an outside pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donor to make a male line of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take the children of that and
you back cross it onto the original
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about like on the previous
on the previous podcast, we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: how, you know, you know, Neville used
Seattle Gregg's NL1 and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: would use that as a pollen donor and would
back cross to make a pure hash plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a pure big bud, to make a pure
Hawaiian indica, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: J.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: from Top Dog, you know, he took an Afghani
one and used that to cross into Chem D and
[SPEAKER_00]: did that a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And made double dog and trace dog and so
on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically what a BX is,
is you find a pollen donor and you cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it to a clone only for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you back, you keep back crossing,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are kind of like the... Locked
down single traits when it's back
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then IX is going to be similar to a
BX, but going further down the line and
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing back to a previous generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like maybe an F6 cross to an F1 of the
same line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be an Incross because you're
crossing in between the same line.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that it is essentially still a back
cross though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only a BX or a BC if you back
cross it to the exact same parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you, for instance, had like a line
of Chem D, for instance, and you crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: your children of that to a different Chem
D parent, it wouldn't be a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to go directly back to the original
genetic stock that started the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise it's not a BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some basic terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers like most of the
cannabis people deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought about like, I don't know
exactly how much time we'll spend on each
[SPEAKER_00]: specific topic, but we thought about like,
it might be interesting to, we thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be interesting to talk about how we
got here as far as breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see in the comments, we have to know
where we're going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to know where we came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the easiest way,
you know, we won't, we could spend an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous amount of time on how cannabis
moved around places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the basic premise is that
for most of the, like what we consider to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like the land race regions,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When people were starting to get imports
into America, they were coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, Columbia, Panama, Jamaica,
Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those types of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were importing seeded weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how did those farmers, how did
those farmers get to the point where they
[SPEAKER_00]: were growing tons of cannabis and
exporting it to our region, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically it's at some point in the
past, we don't need to spend a super
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time on this, but you know,
somewhere humans figured out that THC had
[SPEAKER_00]: cool effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, by a lot of people, you know,
you know, humans started interacting with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and then nature around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started figuring out which ones were
good to eat, which ones were good for
[SPEAKER_00]: health, which ones did this, which ones
did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on a certain level, there was a
point where people figured out that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, marijuana, that, you know,
the wild marijuana strains had some
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, whether it was like hand rubbed
Shiraz, making hashish by rubbing buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: then getting it on their hands and then
rubbing it off and smoking it or consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: it or various aspects like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started to sort out that this was a
useful plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like just every other kind of
useful plant from corn to watermelons to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else, people started messing with
it to get more of what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we think is, is we think as,
as you go from wild populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, that, that started, that humans
started interacting with to plant planted
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of cannabis by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we assume is the traditional method
is that people would go out into these
[SPEAKER_00]: fields and they would pick females that
they liked the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They liked the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They liked whatever it was about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they liked that it had increased THC
compared to its neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would keep those plants and then
therefore next year they would plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of seeds from their favorite
females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then over time, years after year,
generation after generation, humans
[SPEAKER_00]: started slowly improving their local gene
pool and breeding it towards things they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was terps back then, although
they obviously wouldn't have called it
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aromas, effects, weight, you know,
finished, who knows, different farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure had vastly different things,
but you know, farmers back then seed
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting was part of the, the way they
grew everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you picked your favorite plants,
they were seeded and you grew that next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, humans started having
a massive impact on what kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what kind of plants were being
grown because they'd done this selection
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, over time, over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pretty much, I think happened
virtually everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere that cannabis was endemic.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's kind of not well known,
but just really quickly, they think that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sort of started in the highland
areas around China, Tibetan Plateau,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that kind of region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went down into India, it went down into
Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 2,700 years ago, we have
verifiable evidence that the Scythians who
[SPEAKER_00]: were like central Steppe people were using
it in their culture, that it was being
[SPEAKER_00]: used in the very Northern parts of
Afghanistan and in certain parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Caucasus mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also we, they found tea and THC
burned in temples about 60 miles south of
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerusalem about 2,700 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, so there's a situation where
obviously like we have, we don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: long ago it started, but China and Tibet
and the Caucasus mountains and where
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel is right now are obviously pretty
far, far apart from each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially from the way that people got
around at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was, you know, camels, horses,
donkeys, et cetera.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was so smoking and consuming either
hash or cannabis is at least 3000 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old documented in multiple spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably goes back significantly farther
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just haven't found absolute evidence
that it occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, then you have it,
then you have a scenario in which,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's kind of how it starts,
starts up in Tibet and China area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes down into Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: India, Afghanistan, it starts going into
Iran and the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes down into, into Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Russia, it turns into what becomes
known as Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so then, so then there's a,
you know, the, the weird part is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Americas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is how it got to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like, although this isn't a
hundred percent verified, but it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like that most of the stuff that ended up
in America came along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: conquistadors and then later the slave
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a bunch of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp was obviously used for most rope,
most sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sailors brought it with them
everywhere because it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you got shipwrecked or something,
you might need to grow a crop of hemp to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it into sales or rope again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could get off your island or
wherever you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, hemp was, hemp was critical
to that era's trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of brought everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like to Brazil, to the
Caribbean, to Mexico, when they,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they start talking about that kind of
thing, genetically, most cannabis from
[SPEAKER_00]: those regions ties back to some kind of
African.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, there's not a lot of evidence
to back this up, but the strange thing is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is when they did genetic work on
Panamanian and Colombian, that has to tie
[SPEAKER_00]: back to, to Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I only have like one little tidbit
on that and it has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis necessarily, but obviously at
some point, if that, if it's true in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics of Panama and Columbia tie back
to more Southeast Asia region,
[SPEAKER_00]: then somehow it had to get from there to,
from Southeast Asia to the Western half of
[SPEAKER_00]: South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's essentially two options,
either it happened once the Spanish and
[SPEAKER_00]: others started trading with the East after
the conquests, or there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing where there's Pacific
Islanders and some others that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: done genetic testing on in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these islands where they have
discovered pre-Columbian Indian people's
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA in these Pacific Islanders from about
11 or 1200 AD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know for a fact, because they
interbred, they had babies with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They implanted some of their DNA from
pre-Columbian peoples into Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Islanders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know for a fact that hundreds of
years, three, 400 years, perhaps before
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbus sailed and discovered and
rediscovered the Caribbean and Americas,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was some kind of trade or at least
inter-relationships between the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Islanders and the Panamanian and Colombian
peoples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know if people are fucking,
they're probably smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we know that hemp was absolutely
required for sailing, it makes sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: it theoretically could have been required
for sailing back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they traded some of these
pre-Columbian indigenous peoples that were
[SPEAKER_00]: sailing out to the Pacific Islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They traded them some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the seeds would be necessary on both
ports if they're going both places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have guaranteed proof that they were
interbreeding in 1100 AD because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way DNA and genetics works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there was trade ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly when, but it does
seem like Colombian and Panamanian tie in
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow to the South East Asia portion of
the gene pool, not the African,
[SPEAKER_00]: where Mexican, Jamaican, the island weed,
the stuff that's on the Eastern side of
[SPEAKER_00]: South America, that all seems to come from
African origins, which makes sense because
[SPEAKER_00]: there wasn't just a mammoth amount of
trade, both slave and otherwise,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming over from all portions of Africa
over to the New World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know some of it was introduced
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's entirely possible that some of it was
introduced earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of this stuff is not poorly
documented for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conquistadors burned most of the
writings of the Mayans and the Aztecs and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other peoples because they thought
they were devil works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of their knowledge was sort of
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they even had it written down and we
just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you fast forward again and you have
these various people in these various
[SPEAKER_00]: regions that are improving their own
genetic stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in Thailand, the people in
Laos, the people in Mexico, the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, they're growing their stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are working with what them and other
local farmers in their area have access
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're breeding it every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all of these varietals
kind of came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it was all seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was, you know,
and there was two distinct cultures going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should mention this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the North Indian, Pakistan and
Afghanistan regions, it was primarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they viewed the plant as essentially I
don't want to say that it is garbage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they viewed it as a way to get a hold
of the tricones, whether they did hand rub
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was talking about or whether they
did dry sift or whatever method they used
[SPEAKER_00]: to extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought that the proper use of
cannabis was to turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but then you go to Laos or Cambodia
or Thailand or Mexico or Colombia,
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoked flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had some groups breeding for
specific basically hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had some groups breeding for
smokable flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the kind of those were the
kind of selections that people were making
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, obviously,
like America is founded on capitalistic
[SPEAKER_00]: principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's a demand somewhere and
there's a supply somewhere else,
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Smith says that the invisible hand
should come along and get the supply from
[SPEAKER_00]: where it is to where the demand is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all these regions that we've
talked about have been probably improving
[SPEAKER_00]: their crops a year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saving their best seed like they
do with their food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crops, they're slowly improving their
genetic lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really not a lot of
interaction between them and other groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of growing what's available
in their area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except except for the one thing we we had
talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's referenced in Rob Clark's
Hashish book, except in Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_02]: where they were importing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had learned the trade of of hand
rubbing and hash collecting via the route
[SPEAKER_02]: from India.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the stuff during that time,
they were importing Indian more sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: type narrow leaf varieties to Afghanistan,
because that's what the Indians were using
[SPEAKER_02]: to make their hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they weren't using their Afghanis in
their fields yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't using those to get the
trichomes, collect and make the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were actually using Indian sativas
during that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until more modern the past
1950 when they started using and
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting their own varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a better way to more accurate way
to state it would to say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, we can't discount that there was
some regional trading going on right
[SPEAKER_00]: between, say, India, Pakistan,
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all connected to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be Panamanian and Colombian
going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some Caribbean exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, there wasn't Caribbean
trading with Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't like different regions of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regions themselves mixed a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's obviously not written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to determine with any
kind of factual basis how it exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have all these over all hundreds
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that like America gets
involved, you have all these weed cultures
[SPEAKER_00]: that have developed around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are hash cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are smokable flower cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, they made different
decisions on their strains based on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whether they wanted to smoke
flour or whether they wanted to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, prohibition was was fully
going on in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, invisible hand comes in and
there's a bunch of people in America that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to smoke pot musicians, jazz artists,
hippies, counterculture, beatnecks,
[SPEAKER_00]: various, various types of people get
introduced to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely, Mota, probably most people's
first experiences with it were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican coming into the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of back and flow over the
border with Mexican farm working and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably brought it with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely records of famous jazz
people smoking it in the 20s and 30s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking that jazz cabbage.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, obviously it was a big
enough issue that they decided to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy prohibition in the late 1930s up
till that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so then you have a situation where
you start hitting like what matters to
[SPEAKER_00]: most people, I think, with with this way
that we've kind of brought ourselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: here is that various entrepreneurs decided
to start sourcing weed from various
[SPEAKER_00]: countries that grew weed and figured out a
way to get it into America and sell it for
[SPEAKER_00]: a high dollar to American people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference in profit between
buying it from a top high farmer to
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it to a guy that lives in Venice
Beach was extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of economic incentive
for these people to start figuring out
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to smuggle it into the country and
and feed the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sadly, one thing that was so we
start getting imports, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We start getting we start getting imports
and we start getting things from Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start smuggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Panama and Colombia, people certainly
start smuggling from Jamaica and other
[SPEAKER_00]: Caribbean islands, Mexico, Hawaii,
you know, Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pretty famous smugglers that
were working in Thailand and Cambodia and
[SPEAKER_00]: Laos in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start, you know, all the famous
stuff you've heard about Colombia and
[SPEAKER_00]: gold, Panama, red tie sticks, every every
I'm sure Matt can think of some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of them making Jamaican
lamb's bread, you know, Polly from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican, you know, Mexican stuff was
generally named by region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Mitchell Khan, you had Wauhaken,
you had this, you had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you had various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like those were the
first names that you would get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the very first names of weed was
like where it's from and maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: nickname, like maybe maybe they dried
Colombian gold into a brownish gold color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was Panamanian red and it
had red hair or there was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they wrapped they wrapped
in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrapped the loose buds around sticks
to make it like a more go from like a
[SPEAKER_00]: super leafy hermaphroditic loose flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pack them tight to make it into
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get tie stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the original names,
they're not really strange names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, this is where it's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is its nickname that we gave to
it from where it's from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly a color or smell or some other
attribute.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or a rhyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They guaranteed picked it because it
rhymed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that's the reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and so that's when so
that's when like the breeding that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody is familiar with kind of starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all this seeded weed coming
into America from all these regions I
[SPEAKER_00]: named Southeast Asia, the Caribbean,
Mexico, America, you know, South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, I mean, for the younger
cats out there, you know, I used to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there with my head down and a tray at an
angle and you would break your weed up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that allowed all the seeds to
roll down the tray and collect at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom lip of the tray as you broke up all
your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd have a bunch of fluffed up
herb for a bowl or a bong or rolling a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint or something along those lines.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody got free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't really too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we weren't really too much of a hash
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also hash is is trichomes
separated from the flower and the such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that was coming into America
at first was various kinds of sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the sativas were the buds,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were getting imported Afghani
indica hash, you were getting blocks of
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't getting Afghani bud like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come with free seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no free seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though there was sometimes the random seed
in rickahash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The random bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a famous actually there's
some serious debate in Europe over over
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two camps basically on the on the
White Widow camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, just so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason why I bring that up is
because there's a guy over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingmar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the one of the stories about
how White Widow happened is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: founding part of White Widow is he was
breaking up a block of imported hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds fell out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got an original Afghan from some
region out of that block of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was some hash being
imported into America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, you know, it's it didn't
come with free seeds where there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: seedless in any of these other regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the sativas that we were importing
came with free seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that free seed is the start of every
famous breeder you ever heard of's
[SPEAKER_00]: journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people start smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start liking the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what would happen if I started
growing my own weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's places some of them are
pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emerald Triangle, Trinity County,
Humble County, Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live, the Central Coast,
San Francisco, Santa Cruz area of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legendarily, you know, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere where it was mountainous,
people weren't going to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the climate was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying people weren't doing it in
other parts of the country, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, wherever people could start
to get away with it, with their with their
[SPEAKER_00]: imports, they start growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mecca's were built and Mecca's were
built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the only reason why I brought up
those regions is because enough people in
[SPEAKER_00]: those regions all decided to start doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it started the beginnings of American
growing culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in upstate New York or
Oklahoma or Florida or some shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably trying to keep it pretty
small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was definitely some stuff
with hippies in Santa Cruz and Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County and Central Coast and different
areas that they were a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: open with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a little bit more trading
going on and a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: culture started to develop where some of
the other more harsh police state regions
[SPEAKER_00]: of the United States that were a lot more
populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot more secretive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, circles were even smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people start growing seed,
probably with varying success,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they start discovering stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start discovering that when you grow
Thai and you grow Colombian, boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it hard to finish in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the stuff wants to go till
December, January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whether it doesn't go that long,
people start having issues with getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because if you could grow weed
from the seed, then you could get free
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't have to be buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this free weed look like when it
hasn't been compressed and bailed and
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped from, you know, international
locations?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would it be like if you got it fresh?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initial success for people was,
you know, people people could get the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexicans to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Mexicans typically were
farther away from the equator and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had significant struggles getting
the Colombian and the Panama and the and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ties and the different stuff like that
to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this this this is where people start to
get the idea of like, I got some tie stick
[SPEAKER_00]: or I got some Colombian gold and I got
some Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens if I grow them up and I
cross them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's basically it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically the start of American
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the that's the honest to God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the start of how everybody in
America started breeding things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to say America is
unique, but it is rare in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: America is the plate or one of the places
where for the first time in hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: years, people started crossing these
wildly different gene pools from these
[SPEAKER_00]: different regions together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think the way you put it the
other night and I wrote it down because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was it was worded very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever and wherever the weed was becoming
imported the most, that's where the weed
[SPEAKER_02]: was blended together the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that's well put.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and so there's so so,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you know, there's you know,
there's some pretty famous stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: started happening then people started
getting these different these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started breeding them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started experimenting with stuff in
the San Francisco Bay Area and in Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz and stuff like what became known as
Hayes started, which according to Sam and
[SPEAKER_00]: others was essentially Colombian by
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and but you needed a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed they figured with some of these
some of these land races, you needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it in a mild climate, which the
central coast and the Bay Area definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: had and needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed some way to protect it from the
weather and give it maybe some heat or
[SPEAKER_00]: some whatever and finish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start crossing things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the famous people that started
crossing things is a guy named Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob has some very famous stuff that he
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started crossing Colombians and
Mexicans because Mexicans finish quite
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was trying to get the qualities
of the two and get something that would
[SPEAKER_00]: finish in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they start breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, Sam Skunkman is breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's other various people
that are popping and doing all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the the oldest and most legendary
names that we know are from this era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from this like pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some Cambodian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross it with some Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross it with some Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross it with some this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross some Jamaican by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, trade some seeds with your
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, so that's kind of like the
start of like cannabis growing in America.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On any kind of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even when I started in the early
90s, I still have them some over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got like three books that I bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge was extremely limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no forums to confuse you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so even for me in the 90s,
think about how difficult it must have
[SPEAKER_00]: been for the people in the 70s that had
even less knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the things I'll hold it up
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that taught me breeding
was this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Clark took his experience with growing
a bunch of weed and breeding a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he figured out how marijuana grows,
how it breeds, how it triggers all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits, the different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote sort of a Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote a basic Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started out, I was able to buy
this Bible when I got interested in weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to read this book over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it taught me a ton about how to grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Matt had the same experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most readers, most breeders that get
curious about breeding, you've read Rob
[SPEAKER_00]: Clark's book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hear a seed maker and you actually
are passionate and want to learn and make
[SPEAKER_02]: things better, you almost everyone
eventually runs into Rob Clark's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, I think with the Breeder
Syndicate thing, one of the plans is to do
[SPEAKER_02]: for Patreon a course based on cannabis
evolution and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Clark gave us his permission to use
that for a course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that would be pretty cool to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he I mean, I don't need to go
through all of it, but he started talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the differences in latitude and
finish times and the differences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: various kinds of cannabis and regions and
what to expect from them, how to make
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, how to make seed mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he deserves an enormous amount of
credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm sure there was an enormous
amount of fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: When breeding is 90% fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to learn all that and they had to
put that down into some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: information base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure his journey to learn was
significantly harder than the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: came after him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was no books for him to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think there was any
cannabis books in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the 70s, it sort of exploded a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy, who we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Murphy Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Murphy Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his pen name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the gentleman that gave the
Afghani seeds to Seattle Greg,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he used to create what we know as
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote some, I think, like by 74,
73, 74 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some books out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal started
contributing some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Cincinnati Tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was various others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people started the 70s is where all of
a sudden there starts to be like
[SPEAKER_00]: information coming out that people can
access and they don't have to like learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from scratch or what their neighbor knows
or what their buddy that got them into it
[SPEAKER_00]: knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, Rob did things like Rob
crossed Colombian and Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob and Sam Skunkman are friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Skunk One is Afghan by Colombian
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they start blending things,
longer things with shorter things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start looking to see, can I get the
traits of this Mexican with the traits of
[SPEAKER_00]: this Colombian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get this tie to start and stop
herming and not take seven months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bud structure to the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud structure, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and then so people so
people start crossing these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe this is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's really happening in the I
don't know exactly when it started
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the 60s, but it definitely
was happening in the 60s to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It accelerated greatly in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to chime in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg actually said, I studied Luther
Burbank and then bought all of Rob's
[SPEAKER_02]: books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burbank worked with cannabis in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even even somebody like Greg, who's I
consider to be a very early pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's work helped him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so that's kind of and that's
that's also a theme that I'd like to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, right now is that and this
remains true.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what episode we're going to chat
about is that every single breeder out
[SPEAKER_00]: there stands on the shoulders of the
people that came before them, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's the seeds and the genetics
they have access to, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: forums or books or knowledge from older
cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a wave of pioneers that really
figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every generation after that,
every group after that, they got to take
[SPEAKER_00]: their work in genetics and improve it or
mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as the case may be, depending on
your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also got a bunch of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time a lot of you guys on this with
that are listening, got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was probably forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could there was breeding forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you go on the breeding forum of
Overgrow and there's Sam Skunkman and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kamara and people that have a lot of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start reading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the Internet books started
putting the knowledge out there in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to really access, which really
sped up the time it took, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, on a I mean, on a previous
interview that, you know, Greg's on this
[SPEAKER_00]: when when Matt interviewed Greg,
I mean, Greg spoke about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they got some Afghan beans that were
extremely limited from Steve Murphy and
[SPEAKER_00]: they crossed them to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they basically crossed them with
every sativa they knew of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiians, Colombians, ties, you know,
lots of Mexican, lots of Mexicans,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of this, lots of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just everybody was just playing
around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the other part that people need
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that nobody knew what an Afghan by
Mexican would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hadn't happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what Colombian by Mexican would
look like because that hadn't happened
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these pioneers, they're
taking, you know, Rob's like, I wonder if
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Colombian and Mexican and crossed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then maybe later on when
Skunk One is born, Sam is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I got access to some Afghan from
Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's cross this Afghan into your skunk
into your, you know, your Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that'll shorten it up even earlier
and it'll be done in October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this and I think this is a good segue
into talking about how breeding for just
[SPEAKER_02]: to see what happens turned into breeding
for traits as they learn these traits as
[SPEAKER_02]: they as they saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this one's purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one smells like watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one smells like cereal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we combine these traits,
you know, let's let's see if we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: this trait to pop out if we cross this and
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they started going and actually having
a purpose for breeding with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: finding out that there were these traits
that they could follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long flowering, short flowering,
colors, smell, taste, high, all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it went from seeing what can happen to
a real purpose, a real purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think probably the two traits in
the beginning that people were after was I
[SPEAKER_00]: like the way this weed tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't finish where I live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get it to finish where I live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of this stuff like
Panamanian, Colombian, the Southeast Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is all very near the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: America is not particularly near the
equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so they had to figure out how do
I blend stuff to get the stuff I like and
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to grow it in my region?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously there's a big financial
incentive in that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't have to import it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to come through customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where Green Bud was
born.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way that most of these
traditional cultures, they didn't have air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioned dry rooms or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them dried hanging in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them dried in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them dried it and then key load
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it begins to ferment and it gets
wrapped up in plastic for weeks or months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shipped for some period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you were lucky, maybe you got
some green Mexican that was only lightly
[SPEAKER_00]: compressed that they figured out some way
to get it across the border without
[SPEAKER_00]: smushing it into a block that you could
cut with a knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually like break it up into
actual buds instead of it just being like
[SPEAKER_00]: a flat mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so that's where,
you know, Steve Murphy was breeding in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg and his whole Pacific Northwest crew,
the, you know, most people in California
[SPEAKER_00]: were breeding either outdoor or in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indoor wave was still, and maybe this
is a good segue for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I printed out this thing and you can't
really see it, so I'm just going to read
[SPEAKER_00]: it because it's extremely dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a seed catalog, you know,
from 1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tied into sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lists them and his crew,
we assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it lists strains and order of when
they matured, October, November and
[SPEAKER_00]: December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lists like what, so it gives you a
snapshot of what people were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll read it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In October, you had Afghani one,
Afghani two, Afghani two purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one, skunk two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five things before that finish before
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The faster finishing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have November, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepali, Malawi, Nepali, Afghani,
Malawi, Nepali, early Hayes by Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are done hopefully by
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here comes the mother load of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say on this list, it says all of
the above can be grown outside in most
[SPEAKER_00]: years in the SF Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the October and the November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then below it, it says all below
require a greenhouse to finish in the San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got South Indian one,
two, three original Hayes one to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning Bush, Nepali Hayes, Hayes,
Nepali, Nepali, Hayes, South Indian,
[SPEAKER_00]: early Hayes, South Indian, Hayes,
South Indian, Thai Hayes, South Indian,
[SPEAKER_00]: South African Hayes, Burning Bush by
Nepali, Burning Bush by South Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: By South Indian Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you even have one category
matures in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra late New Year's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe when people are listening to
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're you're realizing that,
oh, my God, everything that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning other than Afghani and skunk
I've never had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have I don't I don't I don't
Malawi and Nepali and Hayes, Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepali and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of there's a bunch of
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you like a snapshot of like
these are what the breeders back then were
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing to each other.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is super different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, maybe we can mention
this, even though it kind of like it fits
[SPEAKER_00]: in, but it kind of doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why we're talking about all
this stuff is that basically like every 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, in my opinion, cannabis reinvents
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was common becomes uncommon or
rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go 20 years from that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what becomes uncommon or rare becomes
like impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt and I were recently looking
at somebody's freezer collection that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had been gifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really exciting to look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of it was from 08 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was collecting heavily during that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was Matt's kind of era when he
was really collecting a ton and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's amazing that it's it's only
10 to 13, 14 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 98 percent of that stuff that's on the
list, you couldn't buy today if you wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd be lucky to find a reproduction
if you were lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be lucky to find a reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's some famous people
on there, like, you know, a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that people found fire, OG rascal work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of awesome shit back then,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nowadays, like I even still look out
for like white or colon white master and a
[SPEAKER_02]: few things when I see him in lists.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're they're not common.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was selling tons of those packs
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he was killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still probably is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this stuff that we're talking
about, right, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's common in this in the 60s and 70s
becomes uncommon, common in the 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost unheard of in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: A unicorn by by today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just keeps happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every every 10 or 15 years, what you used
to be able to get easy access to becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: super hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then every generation, those 10 or 15
years, they're building on certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a series of Afghanis that made it
over to Neville and SSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this there's hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's scums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different things that happened in
that in that era that survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the stuff on that list you've
never smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've never smoked burning bush
by Nepali by what burning bush is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it was maybe I've heard I've
heard it was a pre pre to Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was an early, you know,
but but, you know, these names,
[SPEAKER_00]: South Indians, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they they just didn't they just
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these guys, what that shows you is
that all these guys all these guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: basically breeding sativas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the majority of that list was some
sativas, a couple Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Skunk One was 75 percent sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a blend of Mexican, Colombian and a
little bit of Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was still even heavily influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Sam Skunkman became very famous in
that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where he he says he started
breeding his Skunk One in 1960.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he bred it for eight or 10 years
before he brought it to California or
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it from California to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank was working with an Afghan that
got named Afghani One that he got from
[SPEAKER_00]: another Bay Area breeder who had gotten
some Afghani seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got some Durban poison that he was
working in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were breeding some other stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Clark was obviously busy in you know,
Seattle Gregg's neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had somehow come across some Afghan
and they were also blending in some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the various sativas that
people had then in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people call stuff Hawaiian,
but there obviously is no Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety eight percent of the species on
Hawaii are not native because it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: island in the middle of nowhere that
created by a volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people started bringing Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started bringing Thai and Colombian
and Afghans and Mexicans there and
[SPEAKER_00]: blending them and growing them on the
islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they became known as Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even though they're out there,
there's no Hawaiian genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a blending of sativas,
maybe with a touch Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about 55 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to do a short intermission
for a commercial real quick, quick plug
[SPEAKER_02]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're if you're enjoying it,
we have our Patreon shop up or we have our
[SPEAKER_02]: merchant I shop up and we have our Patreon
throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We discuss a lot of this stuff in Discord,
what we're going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go on a lot of topics, answer questions
there, and we have a pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome community for it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to our Patreon, Breeder Syndicate if
you want to participate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, merch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got hats, hoodies, shirts, you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all up in the I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe someone can put the link in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morgan, if you can put the link in there
for everyone to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got the merch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that oh, go check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check out Speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us sell seeds on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: An amazing, amazing group to work with for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing stuff for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think that's all the
commercials we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been, you know, kind of like
took a while, but yeah, it kind of walked
[SPEAKER_00]: people through sort of like and now we're
starting to enter this point where we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk a little bit more about how the
shift happened and then we'll and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because we got some good questions
this week, so we might as well chat at
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast forward a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are doing all the stuff in the 70s
and, you know, in the in the late 70s,
[SPEAKER_00]: things were really blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were doing all kinds of stuff
together in these various regions I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really advancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Carter loses the election.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reagan gets Reagan gets involved and the
war on drugs gets ramped up and the world
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to fuck from the from where it had
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: The penalties are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start putting more money into it and
they start flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start taking helicopters and they
start flying in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start flying in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start flying in the Central Valley
and some of this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that does is that all of a
sudden all these guys are growing all this
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and they're growing it in the
mountain regions and they're growing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: valleys and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not too concerned because
nobody is looking for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden there's a
helicopter flying overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, and they got a big field that
nobody's ever bothered with before and
[SPEAKER_00]: they get in trouble, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So pressure starts happening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they start hunting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start getting in trouble and then
this is when so we mentioned before Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: Murphy's book and stuff like that,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were on what's called the hippie
hashish trail where people were traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: to Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were driving to India.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were traveling to the Hindu Kush
Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were meeting up with tribal people
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was some small amount of
Afghan seeds and Indicas that started
[SPEAKER_00]: making its way into America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mostly only to breeder circles,
certainly not to consumers the way every
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of every sack of weed you bought had a
bunch of seeds in it for free,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they started trickling in smuggling
style to Trinity Humboldt Mendocino to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay Area to various other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in Steve Murphy's book,
you see some broadleaf Afghans in 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you know, you know,
Seattle Greg was working with some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the big advantage in the beginning
to people was that you start crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: these Afghans into some of these sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now maybe you're getting stuff that's
finishing, you know, the more heavy Afghan
[SPEAKER_00]: you select, you're finishing in September
or October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one second, I just want to make sure
everybody's really paying close attention
[SPEAKER_02]: to this part, because I found one of the
biggest myths and cannabis is that
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanis existed in our culture,
you know, just as long as sativas and as
[SPEAKER_02]: long as we've been smoking broad or
narrowly, you know, people didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: that Afghanis came as a late entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see a lot of these people
making claims about 60s Afghanis and 50s
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanis, it's very easy to discount with
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while seed of sativas, like we said
before, we're getting imported by the
[SPEAKER_00]: literal ton with every bag of weed you
bought, you got seeds of seeds in the the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica stuff was being brought back by
smugglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would imagine would be
relatively small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in his interview, you know,
Greg told you that he got a whopping four
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whopping a whopping four,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest problem that, you know,
you grow in Afghanistan and you and you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in the Hindu Kush mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously colder there and it's
extremely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people start growing them in America
and they rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sativas were grown in tropical,
much more humid regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of genetic resistance to
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the things that people
were trying to figure out is they can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: these Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, my God, it's
amazing, beautiful, frosty, crazy looking
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get some weather and all of a
sudden it rots on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a totally different high than a
lot of people are used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People go from an up energetic kind of
zippy high, somewhat psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this that Indica's come with much
more couchlock, much more heaviness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much more limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the early smokers didn't like
Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it clashed so hard with what they
were used to is buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect, they weren't super into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a grower's perspective,
since I read all that stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going from November, December harvest to
September, October harvest, when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: police pressure becomes extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know, maybe we should talk very
briefly because it's a pretty simple
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I moved to Mendo in the late 90s,
people still mostly grew from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the traditional way that you grew from
seed was that you would grow some seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would pick your males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would take your males to like a kind
of a darker part of your hill somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would stash them away from your
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would grow your females in some
patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd collect pollen and you'd go
take this pollen from all your males and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd brush it on some of the lower
branches of your favorite females from
[SPEAKER_00]: that year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that's how the vast majority
of breeding occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when you look at like Rob Clark's
book, he talks about like putting like a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper bag, the paper bag with a tie over
specific branches and putting pollen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag, you know, even talks about like
gluing a grip of clear plastic so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets some sun on it while it's doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most most 70s breeding in America
was pollinating the bottoms of stuff you
[SPEAKER_00]: were intending on selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keeping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, with the police
pressure and stuff like that, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really where modern modern breeding
starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 70s breeding, not exclusively,
but essentially was the vast majority was
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonally they would pollinate their best
females with males they had kept somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the advent of indoor lights and the
advent of hydroponic stores and people
[SPEAKER_00]: like growing in the Pacific Northwest,
like we've talked about multiple times,
[SPEAKER_00]: people started to do some of this breeding
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Away from the helicopters, away from away
from the lights, away from the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also it also enabled people to do
more than one breeding a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back today, it's like back in the
day you got like you got one shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's that's what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden you go indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, as you know, you can get four or
five shots if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when that's when,
you know, prohibition really forced people
[SPEAKER_00]: to start going inside and going inside is
obviously how 99 percent of modern
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, there's not I mean,
there are some people that still breed
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say most people breed outdoor
in modern times because it's much more
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap to make seeds that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the ones that take it very
seriously and are doing actual selections
[SPEAKER_02]: do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally speaking, most do it
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe I should rephrase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the seeds that you guys have
access to that you can buy currently were
[SPEAKER_00]: probably made indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't think so?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all done outdoor in greenhouse.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninety nine percent of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety nine percent of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the seeds that people buy are
going to be coming from places,
[SPEAKER_02]: big seed banks from the UK, maybe stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I was looking at it is most of
the most of the small and most of the hype
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders that people are actually buying a
bunch of packs of these days there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're mostly doing they were
mostly doing it in indoor scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were doing it in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, he's correct in the sense that,
like, if I'm only talking about what most
[SPEAKER_00]: people have access to, obviously when it
comes to like all the Mexican and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional stuff and some of the stuff
that's going on in Europe at a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: scale where legality is different,
like Switzerland or Spain, they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: probably using greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like 95 percent of the market,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: For America, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: American American boutique breeding is
still small market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even then, a lot of these guys are
doing it outdoors, making the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, places like Compton is
crazy, crazy places that you can never
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So small, small greenhouses tucked away
that make the most amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's I think for during the early to
late up to 2008, 2009, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: boutique breeders were all doing it
indoors, you know, indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess that was a poorly phrased way
to say sure that from the 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s and the first 10 years, the 2000s for
about a 30 year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition had a lot of breeding
happening indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your famous strains that you know
of, whether they were from SSC or from
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville or from smaller breeders in
America, all the northern lights work,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prohibition was heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legality was still not spread out very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for three decades, the vast
majority of breeding that we're aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: did happen inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's opened up again, you know,
in various ways in the last 10 or 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's began to shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took legalities changing in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: though, really, I think that's what
changed it when people were able to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor and not get popped for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They realized that the amount of seed you
can make outdoor versus indoors is
[SPEAKER_02]: monumental.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the pollen control is totally a
different subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen control is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pollen viability is hard too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know people that have tried to
throw off huge greenhouse runs and their
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse is too moist and pollen doesn't
like heat, light or water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a bunch of people have a
bunch of failure because they weren't able
[SPEAKER_00]: to control their humidity in their
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think, oh, I'm going to make 15
million seeds and they make 80,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is still a lot, but it's a far cry
from 15 million because they lost control
[SPEAKER_00]: of their humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, part of the, so this is kind
of taking us up to like, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting busted, bad things are happening
and a lot of these American breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what segues into what we've
done the last few shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of these American breeders start
fleeing where it's hot and uncomfortable,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Reagan America, to where it's
more comfortable, which is Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob ends up going into Holland,
Sam, Jim, all these guys are bringing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why Neville and all these groups
got access to it, was not because that all
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys wanted to share, it was because
they were seeking a new place to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: doing what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got real problematic in the early to
mid 80s, late 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, to bring up Seattle Greg
again, he mentioned when you interviewed
[SPEAKER_00]: him that by the late 80s, a rolling series
of busts had pretty much taken out his
[SPEAKER_00]: whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the work that they had done had been
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: To them, luckily he shared it with people
in Holland, Sam Skunkman and Rob and Mel
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ed and these different names that
shared things with groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did so because it was getting
uncomfortably hot to do it where they
[SPEAKER_00]: lived, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to figure out where
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that kind of segues us into what we
talked about, which is kind of where we
[SPEAKER_00]: were at of this is how breeding got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with SSSC and with Neville and
with other groups and that whole era,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only because Holland has not the
greatest weather, but also for clandestine
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons and simplicity and everything like
that, most of the breeding in the 80s and
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s, at least by the mid 80s through the
90s was indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The famous strains, sour diesel was made
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the famous pops that happened
that came about 90s weed was coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was where people could get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were able to grow in the 60s and
70s for a while freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cops found out what they were
doing and they started looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became much more difficult to get
away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then people responded to that
police pressure by hiding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went from sort of like yearly
breeding outside and in greenhouses to
[SPEAKER_00]: much more cracks at the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could breed, you could set up
different rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably very unlikely that somebody
like Neville or somebody like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Super-Citiba Seed Club group would have
been able to offer as many strains as they
[SPEAKER_00]: did without individual rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and I were joking about the amount of
pollen contamination that could have been
[SPEAKER_00]: possible back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly if you were trying to do it
outside in the greenhouse, you're limited
[SPEAKER_00]: to one set of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise it's just gonna be, you're just
gonna have pollen grains flying around and
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing who's your daddy with seeds like a
lot of these guys do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so indoor gardening also allowed
people to, it allowed people to do
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could offer Skunk One and Durbin and
NL5 Hayes and NL5 Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could have, I don't exactly know
the size of these people's rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's probably not that much different
than it was today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bedrooms, some closets, some garages,
some converted spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of like brings us from like
where we were importing indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: people's weed to like how people first
bred in the 70s to how it changed and
[SPEAKER_00]: police pressure kind of led us to like
where we're at today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of leads us right into what
we talked about at length the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes of how Neville was doing all his
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They moved it inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, maybe we can pause since
we're how long in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now an hour and 10 minutes, hour and 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can pause and we can start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, can you see questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can see questions this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we should start an order on the
votes aspect.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are each of your guys' daily driver
strains right now and what do you like
[SPEAKER_02]: about the strains to use them every day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your normal daily driver like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily today, but your normal one
that you would grab if you had it every
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like, you know, I think it's pretty
obvious to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sour diesels and chems and
headbands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like strains that have a
potent and unique high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like strains that I can smoke
every day and they get me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of strains out there that
get you pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first number of days you smoke them
and then you kind of plateau on them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't take you to where you need to
be on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like strains that have lasting power
and the ability to like get me high the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I like every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no, I mean, the Chem 91 makes
me feel like I'm a stone teenager about to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch a comedy eating popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a warm, fuzzy, comforting buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, NL5 hazes can make me feel up,
energetic, maybe a little paranoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, different types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, there are certain things
that are quite famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I find have a boring high,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So chems, headbands, sour diesels,
you know, sativas, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it depends on my mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I don't want to smoke,
you know, a high-end sativa like dog shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: like at 1130 at night, right before bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I might like set my mind off till 1
a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, chems, headbands, diesels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty obvious with mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm a blueberry thing and I like the
highs from different ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem, Afghanis, where most Afghanis,
generally speaking, broadly Afghanis tend
[SPEAKER_02]: to relax people and, you know,
ease them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fucks me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit makes me stay in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like living in your fucking head and
hating life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tend to like the ties that are really
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like lighter highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I have to punch on one, I can still.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to be disabled, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's typically what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one point that we should make is that,
you know, we have some really good friends
[SPEAKER_00]: where some of my favorite strains,
they dislike, they don't dislike them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They breed with them, but they don't think
they're high very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is, you know, everybody
thinks what happens to me is normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with weed, it's not normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can have different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people, you know, there might be
people that have a little ADD that they
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a racy sativa and they feel calm and
relaxed and melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they smoke an Afghan and it makes
them want to jump out of their skin and
[SPEAKER_00]: climb up a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where an Afghan for me makes me want to
like lean back and eat some popcorn and
[SPEAKER_00]: mellow out and laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: An Afghan makes me want it like would make
me like think about chopping down my grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's kind of, it is very
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it doesn't affect people the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is what in your opinion
was the most prominent strain to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Holland in the nineties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than chem, NL, haze and skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I was a big one for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was one of my one that I was
really interested in was purple star.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a, a Dutch purple Afghani of
some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is kind of cheating because
I kind of think it's like modern skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly in the nineties,
you know, sour diesel in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, became, you know, it's, it's a,
it's possibly a blend of chem and skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's not the same, but it is,
it is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not either one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became one of the most popular
strains in America during that timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's hard because when you
say NL haze and skunk, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that have at least one of those
components in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not to name one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard not to name something that
doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, but, but if you're going to
name some of that stuff, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably throw in, uh, the white family
that came out of Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, in the mid nineties,
the white widow, the great white shark,
[SPEAKER_00]: the white Russian, uh, that whole line,
it doesn't have any NL haze or skunk that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was completely, it was
different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all over high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was winning cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting blended into all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I first started growing white
widow and white rhino were the ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like that's what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, another thing is,
uh, this, this kind of, I think this anger
[SPEAKER_00]: is DJ, but, um, you know, DJ gave,
uh, DJ gave Tony from sag Martha,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a bunch of blueberry lines and sag
Martha started selling blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably for most people, that was
their first ability to actually purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he didn't, you know, if he was giving
it to friends or people in his small
[SPEAKER_00]: network, it certainly wasn't as prevalent
as giving it to sag Martha later,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, later on in the nineties, after he had
soured on sag Martha, I believe Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: passion, uh, took over some of his
blueberry work and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether or not he is appreciative
of that or not, certainly sag Martha and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch passion and their breath of sales
put blueberry and those lines on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did give people access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave people the ability to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it made them, it made him
essentially forum famous when cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: world and overgrow were happening because
all of a sudden you could get these,
[SPEAKER_00]: like these cool sounding strains with
these pretty colors, all that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, those were, those were pretty
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to say they certainly caught
Americans attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they are also not an L chem Hayes
or skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, most famous things
have a little chem Hayes skunk or nano and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, he's the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the building block strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to get away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, with me, what was hogs breath creating
or was hogs breath created using SSC
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the only thing I know for sure,
pretty sure is, uh, the Jimbo used,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Williams wonder now, whether it was
Williams wonder across to a random NL
[SPEAKER_02]: Williams wonder across to an Afghani
Williams, one or hard to say, hard to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, his story did change based on who we
told, but that was intentional.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did not want people recreating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that, that cut was kept very tight
until, uh, several years after his passing
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is now out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, his sister has the hogs breath company
and her husband, they're doing an awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: job with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, awesome, awesome clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still getting all my hogs gear and
Jim, Jim was a major influence on me for
[SPEAKER_02]: those that don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, hogs breast, one of my
favorite all time strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe CRD underscore SD is going to be
doing some stuff with the hogs breath
[SPEAKER_02]: family to bring it back again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, can you guys talk about the 88 G 13
hash plant the Indian worked with not
[SPEAKER_02]: bred, please Bode uses it as a male and I
believe Hayes man or someone else,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though they weren't supposed to be
released pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the G G 13 hash plant was
selected, uh, from supposedly bought in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1988 by a sensei, which was not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and that was by swampy who was an
old overgrow member.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian was his friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Indian gets his name attached to a lot
of stuff, but what, what ends up happening
[SPEAKER_02]: is he asks other breeders to send him free
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He distributes them without the breeders
name and it gets, his name got stuck with
[SPEAKER_02]: it again, like the 88 G 13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it is, it is the G 13 hash plant,
AKA Mr. Nice that seed bank or was it,
[SPEAKER_02]: did seed bank distribute it in 88?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a, there's a couple of things
with this throw in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one is this, there is no 88 G 13 hash
plant in the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out in 89.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, what's a year,
uh, anyway, but, and, um, from my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, uh, it had been sort of
bred to F four before Bode got it and Bode
[SPEAKER_00]: cracked them and did some, he didn't
realize it had been bred to F four and
[SPEAKER_00]: bottlenecked a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got it and he bred it and he bred it
a few times and he realized that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding work that he had done with it was
kind of bunk and his best work with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what he crossed everything to and
everybody has access to was actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial seed pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did better with the initial batch of
seeds that he got because they'd already
[SPEAKER_00]: been heavily selected for then him trying
to work within the narrow pool post that
[SPEAKER_00]: he thought he was going F, you know,
F one to F three, maybe he was really
[SPEAKER_00]: going like F five to F eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big difference, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most of what you're getting
when you get stuff from Bode is the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial batch of seeds that he had got
that had already been narrowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know when they came from,
they didn't come from 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they were sold in 89 and in 90,
they were not sold by Sensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think until, uh, they needed
Mr. Nice, I believe until they named it
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt and I discovered that that didn't
pop up in a Sensi catalog until almost
[SPEAKER_00]: 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it was available for two years from
Neville seed bank in 89 and 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's probably where they come
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was probably a pack or two that the
guy bred with, you know, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not that big of a selection
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's the, it's obviously,
you know, I mean, Bode's had some great
[SPEAKER_00]: success breeding with some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's also probably one of those ones
where there's not a bunch of places to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breed is very dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's pretty purple, smaller budded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, some are, some are large yielding,
but I believe the one that the male that
[SPEAKER_02]: Bode uses imparts purple traits,
the deadly Gmail, I think he calls it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, uh, for those that don't know
Swampy who originally put out those G13
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant seeds, he also did a cross
called free Leonard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the G13 hash plant
butterscotch wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the butterscotch wine was a
female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that one was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, who was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Oren that worked with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, yeah, Oren worked with it for
a little bit and has done some cool shit
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it made his caramel line and a lot of
people have since used the caramel line
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, you know, yeah, that's about all
I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question we'll go over very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think Matt and I will both kind of
want to punt on it, but we'll see.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did Barney's farm ever have their own
in-house breeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they always been a bulk seed
reseller?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't think matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a super high opinion of Barney's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think they've always kind of been a,
a seed reseller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they came in very late to the game
when the Dutch scene had already been
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly reduced from its golden and
even silver era.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of came in at the, at the tail
end of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know anybody that has actually
bred for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that they didn't have a
little bit of their own house stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean you couldn't have found good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but certainly most of the Dutch seed
banks in the last 10 years have,
[SPEAKER_00]: have certainly fallen off from what they
were previous to that in terms of what
[SPEAKER_00]: people find from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, next question, longevity on seeds
and pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one is quite easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put seeds in the fridge or the
freezer, um, you can extend their life by
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about every breeder I know that wants
longevity on his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, uh, you know, they put them in
the freezer or the fridge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to read the other
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the pollen, the pollen, um,
Matt can speak to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure pollen is a lot more delicate
than seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot more limited shelf life in
Rob's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about, you know, baking some
flour in the, in the oven, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then mixing that flour, either 10 or a
hundred to one, and then freezing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, uh, pollen is a lot if
you're heat, light water all kills it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a lot less viable than a hard
seed to keep alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, um, that's all I'll say
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any, any way you want to store pollen,
that's not fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's various ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're all iffy, people have some
greater success than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ignore, ignore a few of these because
they're just nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't, I'm not going to,
you know, T, TK, OG, Urkel, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all their own longer things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, uh, do you think Mendo perp is
possibly related to the purple skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only available in the original 85
catalog and it being inbred for eight
[SPEAKER_02]: years and the sativa effects of the purple
Hindu Kush type plant with those purple
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers sounds similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, like a lot of 90s stuff that
you get, uh, the lineage and the backstory
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would prefer to come along with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the only information that I have that
I think is factual about the Mendo perps
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the guy that I got it from grew it
in the late seventies in Kovalo,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a remote Valley in Mendocino
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything other about it
besides that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a famous Kovalo purple,
isn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there, you know, there was,
it's sort of, you know, and part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why part of the, I should say this
too, is that, um, a lot of land raised
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that we were talking about a lot of
it tested between seven and 15% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really the blending of these
various land races and Afghans and these
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridizations that really started bumping
us up into the higher teens, lower
[SPEAKER_00]: twenties, mid twenties type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Mendo perps, while it has
amazing qualities, um, it has very low
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably somewhere between eight and
12% if they're not bumping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which actually kind of lends it lends
to its truth that it could be an original
[SPEAKER_00]: land race brought over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I don't have a region of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the only thing I've ever smelled in my
entire life that smelled like the Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perps was the Nepalese temple balls that I
got from hash smugglers in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that it might be Nepalese
because of that, but I have absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: zero evidence pointing one way or the
other, other than the fact that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's, I don't think it's
purple skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because Matt and I have grown tons
of skunks, various kinds of skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really have any other skunk
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Burkle is purple skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really genuinely do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, uh, CSI probably, I think he is
more akin to something X 18 or PTK,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's purple skunk one oracle,
but I do not think Mendo perps is purple
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some funny ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my favorite color and weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, uh, don't say green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you know, it's, uh,
it's, you know, I, okay, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that purple is extremely
physically attractive to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that the cookies and that the
stuff from DJ short and his son JD can be
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lavenders, the pinks, the blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think the Mendo perps is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think that those kinds of weed,
uh, are as potent and as strong?
[SPEAKER_00]: As the green weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like very light to moderate
potency, it could be your thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but literally every potent strain that I
hold and care for, um, is some shade of
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see purples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love people to breed an extremely
high potent potency purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purple unicorn was, uh, the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim D blackberry widow from Jojo Rizzo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I got Kim D potency
in a just stark purple plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it could exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying as far as most purple
things that you're aware of, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be, they tend to be lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden age of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that question quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, you know, I'll, I'll talk
about this one for a minute because this
[SPEAKER_00]: one's kind of dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's just because I was young,
but I think the nineties was the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: age of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I still think that we could
go into another golden age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's like, it's,
it's unachievable, but the reason I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the golden age is because it was
like the first poly hybrid era,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things were less inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there was a lot more F ones
and various poly hybrids coming out that
[SPEAKER_00]: were quite potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, you know, the chems, the sour
diesels, the NL five hazes, like most of
[SPEAKER_00]: our fame, like very extremely famous that
the cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all originate from that era and
people are still using a lot of nineties
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, um, in their breed work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're some of the most common cuts to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of the backbone of our modern
industry is nineties cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the other thing I think that makes
nineties cuts different is that nineties
[SPEAKER_00]: was the last era before the name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt can speak to this extensively,
but one of the downsides to the name game
[SPEAKER_00]: is that every time a famous name or a
famous craze happens with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many cool, unique things that were easy
to sell before get pushed to the wayside,
[SPEAKER_00]: because as soon as something becomes not
easy to sell, the amount of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are willing to hold onto it becomes tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, um, I'll give you guys a
perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I live in medicinal County
when the, when the purple craze hit and Oh
[SPEAKER_00]: four, Oh five, Oh six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wanted to grow grape ape,
Urkel, lavender, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all these hill people that had
been growing all these killer strains for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time and easily selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they couldn't sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their neighbor was like, Hey,
you grow this Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sell as many of them as you can get
every gram, every gram will go,
[SPEAKER_00]: give me your Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these strains start to get
dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot, a lot of the reasons why we
still breed with nineties work is because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when the that's before the
bottlenecking happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if you look at what people are
selling now, all these boutique breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: every famous thing gets crossed to every
famous thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sour got crossed to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush got crossed to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies got crossed to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they start getting crossed to each
other from both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, measurements by this, by this,
you know, cherry pie by cushments by
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding cake by, and it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blend of the same 30 cuts,
unintentional inbreeding, unintentional
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding because, and that's,
and I don't mean to call out breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what the public wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To, um, Soma definitely all Soma
definitely had some worthwhile offerings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, his lavender stuff was worthwhile
reclining Buddha.
[SPEAKER_00]: His reclining blue Buddha.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got, he got some G 13 by Hayes a from
Neville that he used as a male and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: his Tiva lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that came out to produce a
lot of the CBD lines later on that G 13
[SPEAKER_02]: Hayes milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, when I used to go to
Amsterdam, uh, you could buy his,
[SPEAKER_00]: his bud from the damn crane, which was one
of the nicer coffee shops in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of his weed was quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's cause he kicked it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be nice to people, but he was,
he was a little notorious for potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: running his weed in a tumbler for two or
three minutes before he put it in the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he could collect Keith, uh,
who is a legitimate source for NL one,
[SPEAKER_00]: NL seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem when I mentioned earlier on
the podcast, which is like every five or
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years, weed reinvents itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go look at almost all of these
catalogs from the nineties and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost impossible to find the vast
majority of these lines in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just is, um, it's, it sucks to
say it, but, um, every 10 years stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's, you know, 25 years ago plus,
um, most of the stuff that was available
[SPEAKER_00]: in the nineties is no longer available
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it exists in various hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have a tendency to think that
Bubba Kush is, has heavy NL one influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so I think it's,
it's, I think some of this stuff exists in
[SPEAKER_00]: different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's the sad part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't buy it and store it,
uh, you might want it later on and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: History of the 1979 Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if CSI comes on at some point,
um, uh, aspiring breeders, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, uh, skip that one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not because, not because it's a bad
question, but it's kind of complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I haven't heard of any bud called UFO
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about freeze drying
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's companies out there,
you know, uh, there's, there's companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, that are claiming that freeze
drying is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have specific methods of drying and
it certainly doesn't involve freeze
[SPEAKER_00]: drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: When and who started making feminine ICS?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch passion off, uh, gives themselves
credit for it, but it was actually a man
[SPEAKER_02]: named Mohan Ram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't remember something set SETT
that were first doing the, the scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment experiments on plant reversal
using cobalt colloidal SDS and several
[SPEAKER_02]: other methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's something that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, uh, we'll skip a couple of these,
not because they're not nice questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know anything about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York recreational rules or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about the new,
uh, uh, attorney general for our state
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, central American
cannabis, what's the importance of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Mexican is, is central America,
uh, and Mexican has been bred into all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of stuff, um, that we use,
uh, the other central American countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it certainly didn't have the
impact in terms of breeders working with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly Honduran and El
Salvadorian and, you know, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panama is also, is also technically
central.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is also technically central America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the two famous ones from central
America that have a lot of influence and
[SPEAKER_00]: have been bred into a bunch are Mexican
and Panamanian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cubing, cubing is sort of BXing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way it's kind of a bullshit concept,
but yeah, cubing is, is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a true F1 and you want to
isolate a single one or two traits that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that's effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you cube, then you, then you
cross forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's generally how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, however, I always give this example
every time, um, people tend to think of C
[SPEAKER_02]: 99 when they hear cubing because it was
back crossed three or four times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, can't remember what the claim was from
Seoul, but it was all bullshit anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a sense is in a sense, you don't
want to take a line that has fucking a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand Finos and try to cube it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get anywhere in four
steps back to isolate all the traits like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people confuse that cubing
isolate a few traits crossing forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: isolate multiple traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's really the best way I can
describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that kind of ends most of the
questions I think for this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few we didn't get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think Urkel is super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other people might think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think it's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the more potent
purples, but I would not put it up against
[SPEAKER_00]: the more I would not even remotely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be in my top 10 or even 20,
uh, most potent strains that I've tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the top 10 that will instantly
give me paranoia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, it's just the way it
goes with my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy, there's a, there's a
gentleman asking about, do you think land
[SPEAKER_00]: race seeds are still good at the source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I don't know anything about
those guys, but I certainly support people
[SPEAKER_00]: going around in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he talking about a specific company or
is he talking about, I think there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: company called land race seeds that brings
stuff over from Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not that easy for white people.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go there and collect things right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we went to war with them for a
couple of decades and so it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: sketchy with the Taliban and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fact that you have people that
are going to collect and send seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what will come of it,
but it's definitely an access point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, and, uh, the difference in
early Colombian haze, I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in early Colombian haze and why
it was better was it was just raw crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: and less inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a lot of mistakes made
in the seventies on accident as people
[SPEAKER_00]: learned they didn't use large enough
population sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been documented that a lot of
the best Finos that the haze guys liked
[SPEAKER_00]: started disappearing in the mid to late
seventies because they made some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some poor choices with selections and they
weren't sure what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the South Indian stuff has
kind of been debunked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Sam is saying that it was always colo
by colo, uh, which is Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian by Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's saying that the, this four way blend
is a bunch of bunk, uh, and it's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, I can't, I can't speak to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't know, you know,
I mean, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the end of the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, there's a guy that said
that Mexico is North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm aware that, uh, that, uh,
that they don't consider Central America a
[SPEAKER_00]: continent, but since the question was
asked about what came from Central America
[SPEAKER_00]: that was beneficial, you know,
if people are talking about Central
[SPEAKER_00]: America, it's pretty much Panama to
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I realized it's all either North or
South America as the way that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, geography would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was just trying to answer the
question, the Durban stuff we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: ignore simply because we have some stuff
coming up that I think will shed a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more light on the Durban thing next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't want to chat on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks, two weeks, something like
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively close.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be some really good new
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can talk about it now,
since it's most of it's in the can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is that okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about it real quick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just plug it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could plug it really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, we, uh, we, we were
blessed and we have been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: interview, um, the, the founder of super
city, Sativa seed club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, um, as part of our like eighties
breeding program, Neville's obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: passed, so we weren't able to interview
him, but you know, Neville and super city,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed club were the two largest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a quite long interview coming
that we're going to be giving some context
[SPEAKER_00]: to where we ask him a bunch of questions
about some very famous trains,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was like back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of cool stuff, a lot of stuff
that surprised even Matt and myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, new information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super engaging and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to edit it a little bit in various
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for, uh, you know, but, um,
you know, there's a lot of stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that's going to
come out that, uh, you know, that might
[SPEAKER_00]: make people sad or flip some stories that
have been kind of accepted on their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I think, uh, the Durbin
thing is interesting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, and, and so we'll,
we'll sort of save that, that for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, the Durbin story is a little
wider than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we once thought, let's put it
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have that interview coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super cool to chat with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he'll really flesh out what life was
like back then and what breeding was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of the two biggest seed
banks in the world in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited to be able to
bring that stuff to you guys in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and, uh, you know,
so I don't know that kind of like that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of takes us to, uh, um, that kind of
takes us to sort of the end of like our
[SPEAKER_00]: arc here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We answered a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where we have, uh,
again, if you want to want to be a part of
[SPEAKER_02]: this, you want to be a part of some of the
research we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see a lot of them,
like I, I, I, a lot of people know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I collect a lot of old stuff, you know,
like old cannabis memorabilia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I post a lot of the shots from those
books in there, like, as I come across
[SPEAKER_02]: them, cool shit that, that adds to the
history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we have, we have a depository we're
working on with a lot of old catalogs,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of old magazines, a lot of old books
that are inaccessible to most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we also have the merch up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you can click buy syndicate merch,
um, right under one of our heads and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it should take you there and you can
buy a hat shirt, anything that helps
[SPEAKER_02]: support us.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit costs money to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're actually like, I just bought a
new mic that I couldn't use this time and
[SPEAKER_02]: a few other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does cost money.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you support, the more we can do
and the more we're appreciative and we can
[SPEAKER_02]: do more giveaways and cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just throw some, one basic plug
is that, uh, you know, if you guys can't
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to join, you can always
send it, uh, a DM to Matt or myself on IG
[SPEAKER_00]: or breeder syndicate or breeder syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll share the link, uh, that'll take you
right to where you need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, we have our own,
like, we have our own chat in there where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can ask us questions all the time and
we, we chop it up with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a much more regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, our point to all this is to get
information out there and talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that interests us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, if you can't find it for
some reason, give Matt or myself a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll send you a link and point you on
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope everybody enjoyed, uh,
listening to a longer, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: a longer thing and just hit us up and
we'll see you guys there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as someone said, not so accept my
follow or have three years bad luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: D DM me on, on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have like over a thousand,
uh, I have over a thousand people waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you hit me up personally and I
can chat with you for a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll accept you and we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a link at the bottom that,
uh, breeder syndicate just put up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the thing to pledge at if you
can't, uh, if you want to send us a link,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll send you a link too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we're going to be doing this all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we're going to have some shorts
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some cool interviews
with some old schoolers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have more lives that are
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be some variety and
content coming, um, some more interviews,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, uh, like I said,
some short topics, some more long winded
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an hour and 50 minutes long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we're just going to,
we're going to start adding, adding to it
[SPEAKER_00]: over time and trying to make it cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully everybody enjoyed listening
while they're what they're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I like the, uh, the idea of
keeping us all on an even playing field
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guys like to secret squirrel that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we want everyone on an even playing
field to be able to make the best weed
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause every, if everybody's making good,
we can all build off each other's shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys for showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for showing up.

[SPEAKER_02]: Just me?
[SPEAKER_02]: He bailed and left me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's got to look at my ugly ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I still got to figure out how to
undo this.
