[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: But before it not so gets here,
don't forget to join the Patreon guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some cool shit going on tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some fights that I'll be watching
and it'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have the Hawaiian Lights drop for
the Patreon folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the hybrids are out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been out for about a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be adding those to the non-Patreon
very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got those going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good shit popping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got allergies and my internet
connection sucks today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize ahead of time for any
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still getting over the sickness that
I've been having mostly just in my chest
[SPEAKER_02]: and in my sinuses still.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking bad though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, whatever I got was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm getting sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's Mendo and springtime and
things are blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everything's out and about,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's about that time, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things are I mean, like what's
funny is like a million years ago when I
[SPEAKER_00]: first came to California to see the
Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia Band,
[SPEAKER_00]: I came out here in spring, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything was green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming from Illinois where I'm from,
where it's flat as a pancake because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the glacier, it was, I thought it was like
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all like rolling hills and flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was brutally cold where I lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so nice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got to like 110 and everything died in
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it gets to be like 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you live in the literal frying
pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we live in hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you live in hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not my favorite part of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I appreciate the desert,
but it's not it's not my spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We burst Kevin McCarthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you like flat and dry and
very, very hot, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm nights and good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is our topic for tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as education goes, as far as
education goes, I thought we would chat
[SPEAKER_00]: about a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would talk about maybe sort of like the
very late 90s, early 2000s period in the
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there's a whole bunch of stuff
then that's pretty pertinent to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was all kind of going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we might talk about at
some point probably will fit in because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been a big topic amongst us this week
is a little bit of like authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to, you know, how to address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you address authenticity in these
times where everybody's making money off
[SPEAKER_02]: something being authentic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, you know, people have their
own their own motivations, their own
[SPEAKER_00]: wants, needs and desires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, because some cherry pie,
kush talk, cherry pie might be able to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: into that a little late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of avoided the whole cookie
thing yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's probably a couple of episodes
on its own and it's pretty complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably will chat about that at
some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it needs that one needs some fleshing
out a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a deep run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a deep one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people making a lot
of money off it and there's a lot of rep
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more money and rep you have,
it kind of ties into the authenticity
[SPEAKER_00]: thing we were just talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start talking history and it
interferes with anybody's money or rep and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden they're extremely upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, I mean, I made this I
made this like joking post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't post much anymore on IG,
but I made this joking post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this cartoon and it was like,
I remember it differently in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: fits my worldview and paints me in a
positive light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, relating to weed history,
like you run into that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you you run into that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so maybe we should I don't know,
what do we we're getting up to 150 ish
[SPEAKER_00]: people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to lay out for a couple of minutes
and allow people to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get to a certain point before we start
chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just what is the best blueberry nuts or
dogs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another one that when I tell
you what I think, people will get upset at
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if you talk to second
generation genetics, who is JD,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's DJ son or DJ, they will say the only
legitimate place to get blueberry is them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the you know, for some reason,
the blue bonnet seems to throw these days
[SPEAKER_00]: at least some really potent blueberry
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get to take credit for it,
but I did use it just to be transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had I mean, I'll actually a tie into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had my own blueberry line that I
created before during the time the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: bonnet was being made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lone Star was kind of competition to
me at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was very egotistical about my
blueberry, of course, because everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: thinks they have the best blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did breed true for blue traits and
very beautiful blue turps and very pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't have any much potency or
resin production to speak of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Lone Star did it better than I
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we're lucky is that it still
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can still get it from a number of
different sources.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're up to a decent time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these talks have kind of been we've
we've been kind of moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started in the beginning in the 90s a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're starting to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually still have like a third wave
of seed banks that Matt and I want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that we never actually dealt with that
involves Canada and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it starts to get a little bit more
dispersed and difficult to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's taken us kind of a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot to cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to leave out a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want to forget a lot of
stuff and some stuff we do leave out and
[SPEAKER_02]: forget and have to go back and tag because
it is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of you know, that's kind
of one of the things about these talks is
[SPEAKER_00]: there a bunch of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some there's some speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to be conversational and
tell people about the memories that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll talk about things,
but they get people bent under shape
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than talking about like the
third wave of seed banks, I thought we
[SPEAKER_00]: could chat more about like what was
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was happening on the West Coast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is where Matt and I both live.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was happening on the West Coast in
that era and how specifically California
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that kind of like started to
impact what came after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to let everybody know,
in 1996, in November, they passed the 215
[SPEAKER_00]: Act, the Proposition 215 in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made it was the first state where
you had medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, medical was a very
restrictive at first, and it was only
[SPEAKER_00]: about four or five conditions that it
applied to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops had spent their whole career
just busting anyone with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were also slow to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because they saw weed and they were
like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm arresting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people think that it like just
became legal in 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the era we're going to talk about is
sort of like the very beginning of when
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla started to end and that process
started to really take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was the very beginning of
medical in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things were starting to open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were starting to be less secretive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we mentioned on shows before,
I think it was 1999 that overgrowth
[SPEAKER_00]: started and not that long after the
cannabis world started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the years on when they
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, after a few years,
you had this network of people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting via these via these,
you know, these forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chatting and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one that ended up happening is,
you know, this this started a whole wave
[SPEAKER_00]: of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, you know, really the forums
were the first time you could really ever
[SPEAKER_00]: trade outside your circle that you knew in
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, even even today,
I still see people, you know, in other
[SPEAKER_02]: states where they say, you know,
I can't get that clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in this state and it kind of blows
my mind because back then even like we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't all live in like people were
getting bubba clones from Ohio,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that were in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you didn't necessarily go to the
state to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, one of the things
that's interesting about that is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's there's different people
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good buddy of ours that lives
back in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for him, the forums and IG
and discord and stuff like that was a way
[SPEAKER_00]: for him to talk to other weed nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for somebody like me who lives in
Mendo, like everyone around me does what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no shortage of hanging out like
I'm surrounded by people like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some people that like were,
you know, really intent upon getting on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was their mode of communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of us just lived in places and
stayed off all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like when you popped up or
whatever, it doesn't really like correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: to like what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all lived in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tying into that, I'm I'm probably in my
I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably in my mid 20s or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I meet this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's weird to say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name was Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt knows Ron very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ron was Ron's a character and he's
still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did this thing where he started
throwing these harvest parties in fall in
[SPEAKER_00]: in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually threw him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd rent like a big ass fucking house in
Sonoma County, Healdsburg, outskirts,
[SPEAKER_00]: areas like that, like a big mansion,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had like a catering company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this thing would be you pay a
certain amount of money and this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: would be catered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these heads would come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was the first time for me that I
really was around like that kind of scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: because most of those people that were
there, like they knew each other from
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow or Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like groups that came with
people like me and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that like were from that area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of people from all
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people running who?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron is, he's NCGA, Nortel Growers
Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people associate him with like
the Blue Widow cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of his big jams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to help people get set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been pretty politically
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been a lot of the fairs and a
lot of various things that went on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with he'd usually have a booth
and he politically organized early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say he got me my first Emerald Cup
Cannabis Cup or a Cannabis booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first booth I ever shared in
Emerald Cup was with Ron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I, I went to this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was twenty three, twenty four,
twenty five, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got invited by a buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was neat about it, you go to this
place and you walk in, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, huge dining room table or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone that wanted to share,
you would write your name, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: usually like the handle from the forums or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would write your name and you would
put some weed in the bag or the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the whole table is full of
different kinds of weed and hash samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's, you know, and then it's one
of those things where you hang out for two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three days and smoke a ton of weed and
trade seeds with people and trade strains
[SPEAKER_00]: with people and shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go there and I'm young and I'm hoping
to meet like I am like so convinced,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, that that I'm going to meet these
old timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning my age now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's at the time, you know,
I dirty old song was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I'm all convinced I'm going to
meet all these people and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it's going to like unlock the
key to a bunch of old school strains I
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get there enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was there was so much like
everything that was super popular in the
[SPEAKER_00]: very early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like Apollo 11, Apollo 13,
C99, C99, you know, White Widow hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: frickin SSH hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's telling us the best times I ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super cool parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was really cool to to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a bunch of people there
who I won't mention because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be popular, but I will tell you,
that's the first place that I ever met CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first place that I met Shaw,
who some people probably know as 707 Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank on IG, who did the, you know,
the chem, the chem dog BX two and a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of work with cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people got Bubba Kush from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's a he was a pretty big guy
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pretty involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaw, you know, people like Jason King
from the Canna Bible, Kyle Cushman,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrera, you know, just, you know,
a bunch of mountain men from Mendo and
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then various types of people
like Chip, who now has a the Real Dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was actually when he at those
parties, that was before he started Royal
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was still working on like Coco Fiber
then that was so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco Fiber wasn't even a commercial
product available in stores yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was planning on bringing it to to
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hadn't started Royal Gold, but he was
planning on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so a lot of us that was that
was a lot of times where the where we got
[SPEAKER_00]: to put faces to names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I didn't even know dirty I
would have loved to have hung out and
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to dirty old saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know, you know, if I met if
I know your real name, I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a but there was a bunch of
people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Chip, for instance, who started
Royal Gold, he he had just come back one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those years he had just come back from
Switzerland, a tour in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for people that don't know,
Switzerland was like the first place in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe to really open up to cannabis,
like outdoor and greenhouse style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when Amsterdam and Holland got
rough, Shanti and Breeder Steve and a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of different people shifted over to
Swiss.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Chip had gone out and visited those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's got all these pictures on his
computer of like these greenhouses full of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 10 foot tall plants direct planted in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just yeah, Vickai.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really neat because it was a
lot of it was a lot of connected people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of people that were active on
the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was five or six or seven years before
the reversal era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything was everything was red
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any any as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think I'd heard the term as
one outside of a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was hybrids, you know,
and people would bring their hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring their seeds, bring their own
personal breedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a way instead of mailing
each other and giving out addresses and
[SPEAKER_00]: DMS and all that, it was like a super swap
meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really neat in that regard,
because for one thing, Ron had a catering
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the money that everybody
pitched in, he hired his whole team and
[SPEAKER_00]: you and he made two meals a day for three
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to sit there and roll joints and
smoke and shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pull tubes and trade seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're fucking starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like some like tuna and crisps
comes by the thing, you know, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just so high and you just start
eating some of that and drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you feel a million times better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the reason I bring that up is
because while now with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: events and a lot of these lives and a lot
of a lot of times like putting a face to a
[SPEAKER_00]: name has become common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then it was uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like really it was really it was
really like unusual and neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You felt special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there was, you know,
there was times where I mean, I went I
[SPEAKER_00]: went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, the foods were to die for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fully catered, full on meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd have snacks and hors d'oeuvres that
would be get brought around finger food
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty decadent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just like anything else,
even if you're an experienced smoker,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start smoking eight, 10, 15 kinds of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't normally smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the first time you're smoking all
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a week or moderate weed will get you
pretty baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, if you're just pulling all day
nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there was different
things where it was like you can't hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out with everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you make friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some friends I made there, you know,
I kept up with really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others like CSI, I didn't catch up with
again for a number of years after those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you just you're in different
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, you know, all that different types
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Eddie let just it was kind
of just like a who's who.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of a lot of the times those
people Fletch, people that weren't very
[SPEAKER_00]: well known then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're all hella well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they have some of the best
seed banks, you know, some of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best collections of weed
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I went there, I didn't have
most of the stuff that I have now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I had I had the Maui and I had the
chem 91 and the super skunk and I had the
[SPEAKER_00]: super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My my buddy who doesn't like to be
mentioned, you know, from Staten Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: he came a couple of years with us,
you know, because we were still like right
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle of doing that super dog
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we had different phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had hash that we had sifted from things
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just a really neat gathering in
time period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People keep asking, like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I think we did a good job of
recreating a little bit of that just a few
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people weren't invited,
you know, because it was smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I think that there's still an
ability for our community to pull together
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have these big events where people
just get along, chill and smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a privilege because I wasn't
around for the Ron parties at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a privilege to be a part of the
the can of Luminati parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are it was fucking insane to be a
fly on the wall at those events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they keep they do keep happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that, like, they probably
won't happen like that quite again.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just the simple fact that shit
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew who CSI was then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew who Fletcher was then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knew who I was that, you know,
I mean, there was people that were known,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but a lot of them were we were
all in our 20s or whatever, just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out, you know, various aspects of
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we were all learning and
trading from each other and seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: was up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, you know, it was just days of
and there also wasn't a bunch of money or
[SPEAKER_00]: rep involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like the last era before
that era started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were all young, innocent and dumb
and, you know, and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less of a competitive nature, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, I came home with so many
seeds from that event and I gave away,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you've got some sweet tooth by
Blockhead from Steve, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, give me a hundred of those and I'll
give you a hundred of this and this and
[SPEAKER_00]: this and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was like, try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it hadn't been monetized yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one really believed that you could make
a bunch of money in America selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that it didn't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like all these heads each with
their everybody was happy to like they if
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get people you respected to grow
your beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that was everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, that was like, you know,
and then they hit and they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, I found fire in your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're like walking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel good about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read, you know, good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and yeah, in the forum era,
Caleb was white trash, redneck or
[SPEAKER_00]: inspector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, these turpogs,
I've never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to bounce around because
all those different things sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of like put a you know,
Ron's parties were where a lot of us made
[SPEAKER_00]: friendships with each other, where a lot
of us met for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brought together different disparate
groups of weed heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From their 20s through their 40s,
you know, 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went on for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it happened in the in the falls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should also mention because this is
pretty important to that era where this is
[SPEAKER_00]: before the Urkel and the and the purple
craze really took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really important because all
good weed still got grown and was sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really hadn't been waves where it
was like, get this one cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cut, you can sell all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hadn't really happened yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I attribute a lot of that to fucking Jason
King, too, for hyping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking hard that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's it's it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily attribute it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I attribute it to the brokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, because I can't talk about other
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in Mendo, let's say oh,
four or five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to have a 50 lighter and you
wanted to sell every gram of your weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had granddaddy purple or Urkel or
something along those or Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had sweet tooth by Louie,
maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you probably could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there wasn't buyers shooting up from
the bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got I got room for X amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me that sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, but, you know,
because all that all that work,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say that like so and we'll talk
about that at some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what were the all the popular things
you can think of were at that party,
[SPEAKER_00]: both his flower and hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white family was crossed into
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shorts, the blueberry family was crossed
into tons of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brothers Grimm was crossed into a
different amount of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, you know, a bunch of
classics and things like that that will go
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still doing big stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federation was still doing big at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, I can answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just said, where is Jason King?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was actually well,
that that'll overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really was it really was like,
you know, you hear about the legendary
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest festivals that happened in
Humboldt or Mendo, small little gatherings
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what it felt like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it felt like being able to go to one
of those type of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, you really just talk shop
and weed with your close group of hermit
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to getting to go to a like and
hang out with dozens of different people
[SPEAKER_00]: for three or four days and chat and chat
it up, really set the foundations and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the a lot of the friendships and
stuff for later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really made a big difference,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, friendships were forged,
their transfers were made, their ideas of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot for a large part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like when you started coming
in heavy, like it was all a bunch of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was still very much around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I first started coming in heavy,
I was looking for the Blue Widow clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking for the sweet thing clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're looking for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like that was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was like what everybody had
in clones, what they had in flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and seeds and all these different
types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Kyle was there documenting it
for high times, although I don't think Ron
[SPEAKER_00]: let him actually made an article about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because he wanted to keep it like on
the down low and not fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but you know, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we're going to kind of
bounce around all these different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is it all overlaps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody asked about Jason King,
it's probably a good time to chat about
[SPEAKER_00]: that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, there was this guy's name
is Jason King.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had this idea that I'm going to
take a bunch of pictures of famous
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to write my own super
opinionated blurb about each one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called it the Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think anybody knew what he was
doing at the time would be would matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he did, which is super cool,
is he came out with about three Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Bibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sort of document this whole like
late 90s through early to mid 2000s era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before the Clone Wars, where all
these specific clones of Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel, Sauer, all that started just
dominating and a lot of these random
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids started to becoming hard to find.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came out with this Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the coolest things about the
first Canna Bible was that the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: first introduction is written by one of my
weed heroes, Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rob did Rob did this thing where he
wrote this big introduction into the Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible, which honestly, I'm not sure anyone
could have done that and given as much
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimacy to Jason King as Ron Clark
writing a big, long seed history and clone
[SPEAKER_00]: history introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, like I've said before,
Ron wrote the Bible for seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob, sorry, Rob, Rob, Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Clark wrote the Bible for seed
breeding marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote his sheesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an encyclopedic knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely like one of the elders of
the whole marijuana thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's made lasting contributions
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so him writing that and what he did is
he outlined which strains, which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge debate even back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which strains went to Amsterdam as clone
onlys and which strains went to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: as seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a timeline of who gave what that was
kind of brief, but who gave what over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a timeline of like all these
different seed companies and what years
[SPEAKER_00]: they release different versions of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hit his chart on the release of seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I'd heard of like
lowland seeds and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the pearl stuff is him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's asking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pearl is all the pearl stuff is related to
Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so for a lot of us that you're
trying to piece together all this shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a guy in the know that knows all
these various seed companies and breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: and work and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he he outlines this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so he so he comes out with
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He writes this big long thing,
which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite part of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to the rest of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the book is a bunch
of Jason's opinionated comments on
[SPEAKER_00]: different pictures of weed he's taken and
what he thinks about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get this thing and I'm super nerded
out by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, flash a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this gentleman who just
passed away not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his name was Eddie Lep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eddie Lep had a farm in Upper Lake,
which is about 20 minutes from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grew a bunch of weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really blew it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's one of the he's one of the best
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the early biggest flaunters
of 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I'm going to follow the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people that a lot of
people met there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I met Jason King, both there and I
should should say at some of those early
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we became good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through, you know, through those
connections, through hanging out at Ron's
[SPEAKER_00]: parties and then through you know,
he was he was a photographer and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: document weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody back then was fascinated
that Eddie Lep was willing to fill a field
[SPEAKER_00]: full of cannabis and be like, come get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and and and so I decided
to help Jason with his with his project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to make a second Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd lived in Mendo at that point,
a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt, as you're well aware,
weed was weed world was still insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much going to get a bunch of
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to meet all the right
people without an end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still kind of that way for the old
school guys, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, but nothing like it was hard to talk
to you, but nothing like it was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you couldn't even find how to
contact an old guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least now they have like maybe an IG
page or some some way you can track them
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first got into this, I remember I
tried tracking out DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: To speak to him, you know, no dice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to find where he was going to be
speaking and see him in person if you
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to get a hold of it at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll we'll bounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll bounce around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so everybody knows, I'm going to talk
about Eddie and that and that whole era,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so these things all overlap because
they're all going on basically at the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron's parties, Eddie's scene at an upper
lake, the stuff that I haven't talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: Canna Bible, all this stuff is all like
half happening and is part of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: flow, same few years.
Right.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I become friends with Jason and I
decide to help him with this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get him introductions to people,
let him meet other people that can help
[SPEAKER_00]: him kind of navigate through Humboldt
Mendo and document and all that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of all that, you know,
and I should say this is that I I was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good friends with Jason back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't we've drifted apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's lived on Maui now for a long time
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to Hawaii or haven't had kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of drifted apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still on good terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a super opinionated guy and he used
to drive some people nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are people that will be like
that guy drives me fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always got along well with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, I was very sympathetic
to what he was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another weed nerd trying to fucking
put the people pieces together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I strongly disagreed with him about
certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that, you know, and we would
battle about, you know, all kinds of shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not that's not any different
than today with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was documenting and there's a lot
of there's a lot of things in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you talk about like the
bull ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fell off the wayside that's
documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and so I started helping him
figure out this different stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, and me and Eddie and
some other different folks started helping
[SPEAKER_00]: them put together the can of Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by helping, I just mean making
introductions and, you know, can this dude
[SPEAKER_00]: with a camera come to your scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's kind of crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have some trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bring a dude with a fucking camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and just so people get an idea,
this is pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Jason got a 12 megapixel
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a super nice lens on it to start
taking pictures, because the first can of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible was all film.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 12 megapixel camera with a super nice
lens was over eleven thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dead serious, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over eleven thousand dollars because I was
at his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually rented this house from Eddie
Lepp that was in Lake County, not at Eddie
[SPEAKER_00]: Lepp's property, but a separate home
healed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I live 20 minutes in there
for we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were together all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I like I said before
about Rob, about Ron's parties at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing the super skunk,
the the chem dog, 91, my dog, Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps the black, the black domino,
the snow, the Trinity, a bunch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: super dog crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hybrids, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I start helping them get
all this stuff photographed and
[SPEAKER_00]: documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and it was pretty neat in
that regard because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they there's a lot of stuff that was like
that's been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there's a tone that's in those
books, but there's video, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: picture evidence and there's various
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, so if people are interested
because of that close relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bunch of stuff that ended up in
that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: The I grew the dog both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in this process then of growing a
bunch of my favorite strains, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and then full salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the same room at the same
time, right next to each other and then
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a bunch of blind taste tests with me
and my friends and trying to actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, which is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I so there's there's the chem 91 is in
there is both dog and chem dog grown both
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Mendo perps is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snow, the Trinity, my super dog seven
cut that I lost is in there, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid between myself and the guy from
Staten Island made this line, basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk chem dog line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is Mendo perps crossed with effects,
which is a cool story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, somebody said coral reef.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our buddy Fletch has been hunting for
that for a super long fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody knows where the coral reef
is, hit us up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, like that that that that super
dog thing is is the odd connection that me
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have where I spent years and years
and years trying to figure out who made
[SPEAKER_02]: the fucking super dog by asking around the
whole chem fam, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point, I couldn't get any
fucking answers like half the half the
[SPEAKER_02]: people would say, yes, it's diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just another day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have to be that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember before we met, I remember
in 2010, I made a super dog 2010 trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: recreate what I had read about in the
Canna Bible because I could never fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many, many years later, when we
finally interacted, I realized you were
[SPEAKER_02]: the source of the super dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was such a big, long chase for
me because of that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't really want to tell the
story of how I lost it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember, like, I mean, I had it at
all those Ron parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I passed it out freely to a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a bunch of super dog hybrids to
Mandelbrot and ended up being a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basis of a lot of his males that he
started using to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even back then, everyone had to
use pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that everybody doesn't use pollen
today, but everybody had to use like
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like full regular males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversals were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, seven, eight years away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't even we didn't even know the
only reversals anyone ever heard of is
[SPEAKER_00]: accidental herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes if people wanted to make
accidental herms, they would torture their
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would beat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would make it dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would make it almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Die.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would fuck with its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just torture it and see,
can I get it to pop a bunch of pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I don't have like I lost the
super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost the purple effects, but there's
write ups in that book of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, which is pretty neat, because
there's there's at least pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how it got documented and why
we still know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I should tell I should tell a funny
story just because so Jason had this
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend named Rebecca back then and he
she was from North Carolina and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: this strain that is semi known right now
called the mothership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this old ass weird sativa and
Jason just raved and raved and raved about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he got his girlfriend's friends to
mail it to him in in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're thinking today, you know,
with all the mailing tech that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you're thinking some like small and
innocuous package or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this this fucking thing shows up and
it's a box that's about a foot a foot wide
[SPEAKER_00]: and a foot, you know, this and two feet
deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fucking box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we open it up and inside are
two motherships with a bunch of with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuffing around them in one
gallon pots tied to stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like they're like 18 to 24
inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of the person mailing us cuts,
they mailed us like one gallon pots of
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt and 18 to 24 inch tall plants in the
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the box and it's like two plants
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was so unusual, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the post office was hip yet
to like weed and like especially plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail sending big ass plants in the
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually in that Canna Bible,
there's some there's some pictures of that
[SPEAKER_00]: mothership because I was one of the first
people that grew it because I actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: running grow rooms and there's pictures of
the mothership at Eddie Lep's property.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pictures of the mothership from my
greenhouses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really unusual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, it got mailed to us in the
most sketch way imaginable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember in Canna Bible, I think it was
the mothership that at one point,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason King was trying to say this has to
be related to HB 13 because I've never
[SPEAKER_02]: tasted anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of those extreme speculations
that he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I should say, I mean,
he's my friend and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You read the descriptions of like the dog
and the chem dog and different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even wrote down like lineage and
history for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he went to do his artistic
interpretation of what he wanted to write,
[SPEAKER_00]: you read it and you're like, oh,
that's fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Journalists quoted me incorrectly or
totally out of context or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but at least that's a documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and well, so one thing I'll say,
and then we'll move on and we'll talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about Eddie's situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that so we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to lose my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jason decided to do a Canna Bible
release party for the second Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided to invite everyone that
contributed to the book with pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone that helped him put together
and a who's who.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they and he rented out this very this
very magical place, which I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: most people have heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this place called Orr Springs in
Mendocino County and it's a natural hot
[SPEAKER_00]: springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so it's got all these like
cabins in the woods and stuff and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful redwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right next to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I said yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's right next to Montgomery
Woods, which has some of the tallest trees
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think three out of the five tallest
redwoods are all in Mendocino County right
[SPEAKER_00]: next to this this hot springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty magical place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he does this thing where he throws this
three day Canna Bible release party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all get to come and we all have our
little rented cabins and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing like one of Ron's parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it's a bunch of seed swapping
and trading and all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eddie Lep's there and and Rob Clark's
there and and, you know, Caleb and John,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all just all the people I already
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the same people are there and a
lot of people that contributed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie Lep, his whole entourage and all
these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to meet one of my heroes at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet D.J.
Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's one of mine that I got to
meet, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and that was that was kind of intense
because, you know, as we've mentioned on
[SPEAKER_00]: previous podcasts, you know, if you're a
weed nerd on the forums, you've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: is way pre cookie, too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all these like, you know,
test grows and stuff on the forums of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these beautiful blue families,
hybrids and blue and blue work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm in my mid 20s or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: is significantly older.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you feel like you're meeting an
elder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just starting to fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my buddy from Staten Island and
myself, we've been breeding for a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of years at that point with our super dog
and different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we kind of felt like we were just
getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's this guy that's like was
released in Europe in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked with Sag Martha, worked with Dutch
Passion, had Canadian stuff, had this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody back then was kind of on his
jock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he was kind of a famous guy that,
you know, he was internet famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him, Hempi, Vic High.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was some really like
famous internet personalities on those
[SPEAKER_00]: early forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: D.J.'s work was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stood out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of the first American
breeders since the breeders who first
[SPEAKER_00]: brought their stuff over to Amsterdam,
like Sam and Rob and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like the next wave of people that
got famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't that much competition
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say Hempi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempi was a fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hempi had a lot of good points,
but man, was he a tough character.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a he was he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you said something, I mean,
a lot of those guys like Tom Hill and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, if you said something ignorant,
they just tear your fucking head off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't even be put in that same
category.
[SPEAKER_02]: He may be stuck as an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was he I mean, you know, I had to deal
with him too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I, you know, D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: is at this at this Canna Bible release
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he shows up at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to him, it was probably like there was
a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a custody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he shows up and he's got little little
manila envelopes, you know, with just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 50 and 100 of all his lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think back then was only four or
five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only a few lines at a time that he
would ever sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just super expensive for the
time, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had blueberry and he had a flow and a
blue velvet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe the moonshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue moonshine or all time moonshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was blue moonshine, blueberry and blue
velvet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CSI and I get to talking to him,
you know, and I have to say and he's still
[SPEAKER_00]: around and stuff and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to be kind of irritated at
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was my first experience with
realizing that a lot of these old time
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders don't know that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I thought here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's this guy's been doing it 15,
20 years longer than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's made all these amazing
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's getting all these amazing
hybrids out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's releasing all these inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who doesn't like the word juicy fruit
tie or purple tie or this or that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're all fucking pumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start talking to him and he's
vague as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like super vague.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's I think that is one thing that I have
found with people that whose opinion I
[SPEAKER_02]: respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that has met DJ Short,
including me, has had the same experience
[SPEAKER_02]: except that he and with me, he just told
me, I don't own my own company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, you know, I'm not going to
say he wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was open and he talked for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked for hours over multiple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was shooting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super jovial and conversational and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like we were talking about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but but, you know, I kind of
feel like having being a weed nerd myself
[SPEAKER_00]: and talking to tons of readers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one thing you can do,
you can talk in detail about your own
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you should be able to because it's
your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like you're fucking a weed nerd
and you're fucking into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's your passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and you can just do that
shit off a memory you don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just kept saying stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'd have to go back and look at my
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd have to check my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'd ask him, like,
why didn't, you know, did you ever did you
[SPEAKER_00]: ever back cross or did you ever use any of
your original genetics again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, no, you know,
he's like, at the time he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have thousands of seeds,
but they're so old and I haven't stored
[SPEAKER_00]: them well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just remember like walking away
from there and just being like just I just
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I was going to get a wealth of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the hours and hours that I talked
to him, I don't I don't even know if I got
[SPEAKER_00]: too many tidbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then if you read his book,
now it's going to sound like I'm dissing
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very, very rudimentary way of
growing inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the one thing I will say that I think
is super cool about his book is he does
[SPEAKER_00]: describe a bunch of weed that he smoked
when he was younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite part of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also does this thing where he
has this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we didn't no one use the word
terpenes back then, but he tried to make
[SPEAKER_00]: like an olfactory chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a smells chart and break down what
smells are related to what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is a really good chart?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a fantastic chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it still, because
anything that trains you to speak about
[SPEAKER_00]: things in language is helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, he was talking about like
squirrel cage fans and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of like, you know,
he kind of grew in trailers in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_00]: and use that use very 80s tech and never
really advanced.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be that as it may, despite being very
disappointed by talking to him about
[SPEAKER_00]: things, I still bought like 400,
450 of the seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every line he had the velvet, the
moonshine, the blueberry, the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought, you know, I don't know,
75 to 150 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I and I and I went home and I grew
them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is the name of the book is like
Cultivating Exceptional Cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the top of my head, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really pretty flow plant or
something on the cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some other people have said it's a
blue satellite, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's some some discrepancies on
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things I mean,
when you interviewed Chimera in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, one of the things that
Chimera is good friends with DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's not going to say anything rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he did say is he kind of
basically admitted that he thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that he had was like the same
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like DJ would see an expression within the
line and he would be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blue velvet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I just breed stuff with expressions
like that, it's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not really what was going on
either, because he was crossing opposite
[SPEAKER_02]: to to opposite when he was doing line
breeding, working directional,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what you don't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very artistic take on breeding for
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fairness, like we said before,
they were writing the book as they were
[SPEAKER_02]: going, you know, like these were guys just
getting in a can of reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no books to be had, you know,
at the time when DJ was doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mad props to him for fucking doing what
he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to work with a bunch of his
work that I'm stoked on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not as stoked on his human work as far
as human breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, you know,
like as far as cannabis breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a big debt of gratitude to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just, you know, it's one of those
like he that's the conundrum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all this amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how it all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine people listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out four hundred fifty seats over
the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'd like to say I found a
few keepers that I miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I it was unbelievably beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it, especially pre cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was lavenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was various shades of in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have a lot of turps and it
didn't have a very potent high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I outgrossed it to different
things, I got way better weed than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything of the pure lines I got from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine how fucking excited I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now there's no seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no middleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I'm getting handwritten vanilla
envelopes from the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real deal Holyfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to find the fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real shit labeling backing everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know how it goes when you're
running hundreds of things and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep track of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's a huge pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just recently did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people are talking about,
you know, popping four hundred fifty seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: in the in the chat and not finding
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just recently popped almost the same
amount of stuff from from blue lines and
[SPEAKER_02]: went through all of it and had a very
similar experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say something because there is some
there is like an economic aspect that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where back then, you know, most fire
indoor was, you know, four to forty five
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really easy to grow flour and
have a side room or two with a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in each for experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the the rate, you know,
a twelve lighter kid was was everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you need in life if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the economics were really easy to allow
people to experiment and fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now things are super tight and it's gotten
quite hard and mathematics and economics
[SPEAKER_00]: are much more difficult right in this
particular period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, you know, it was like
that's what kept the cropping from being
[SPEAKER_00]: boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from the chat, but it's a good
question and relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did that Swami guy come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he around when you were hanging out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I didn't see Swami.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's a pretty recognizable
character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, yeah, you wouldn't even if
you didn't become friends with them or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, like you wouldn't have mistaken
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we'll get we'll get to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to I don't want to break it
up, but we'll get to that when we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the authenticity part in a little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as that goes, because there's a
bunch of people that one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis I'll talk about super
briefly is that you can just sort of step
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are like, I don't believe
where this person came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm I'm who I am, I would have known
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, it's it's one of
those things where there's a lot of shady
[SPEAKER_00]: characters in cannabis and there's a lot
and there's a lot of people who make good
[SPEAKER_00]: and bad opinions about people on the
Internet that you have never met and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't hang out with in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt and I are friends in real
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we're real life friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made we've made real love to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, platonically from a
distance, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a bunch of people who become
fanboys or girls of different people and
[SPEAKER_00]: attack whoever they want to and stuff like
that, you know, and it becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they don't know their enemy and
they don't know their friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know, like a social media construct
of that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but we'll get to that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scrolling back, you've got you've got
Ron's parties, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being sort of a nexus for this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got you've got the Cannibal
parties, which were another nexus bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: people together, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was I have to say I was super
disappointed because I really feel like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you take home 450 seeds from
four different lines from a breeder and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't find anything you really think
or want to keep, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he gave me a good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I paid full custody because
I'm at the no.
[SPEAKER_00]: He liked to make money, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but the the size of the room,
the amount of just everything that goes
[SPEAKER_02]: into the economics are growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I talked before,
it was like, you know, there's there's
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or ten American elites of NL five
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I ran 60, 70, you know, five days
and didn't find any of those keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other people did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so DJ was a disappointment just
in the sense that he comes from like a
[SPEAKER_00]: different generation of weed nerd,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they're just not that deep into
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, one thing you can say
about Rob Clark or Sam Scump, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's whether or not you want to believe a
bunch of what they say or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy on detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the old a lot of the old guys you
talk to, you know, they're light on
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't remember or they try to make
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they just don't like it's even the
same thing with like the sour stories or a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of stuff that happened in the 90s that
we try to get to the bottom of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know it was going to be
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure DJ thought he was always
going to be important based on having met
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure he always believed he was
going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I said, over that weekend,
I probably talked to him for five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six hours, seven hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were there for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we were doing was like literally
smoking weed and hanging out and shooting
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit and eating food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would have loved to have had that
opportunity with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just it just seemed so not interested in
discussing anything with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was it was it was hard because I I
did look up to him so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that I lost respect for him,
but it's just like the more I learned
[SPEAKER_02]: about breeding hands on, the more I
learned about why his lines turned out the
[SPEAKER_02]: way they did and why I was having such a
hard time working those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it all made sense in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, I don't I'm not
dissing him because like you're fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: around the 70s or 80s or even in the 90s
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you learn as you go,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bottleneck something when it's early
on and that's what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I'm not dissing him by any
means because there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's I think his lines are
overly inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely over the inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the most fire weed at those
Ron parties was outcrosses of blue of blue
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing wrong with having an
inbred kind of unique to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes some out crossing to really
bring out its true character.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's kind of what breeders would
want, something very stable and worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think that's a diss
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, I wish that DJ would have
repopulated his juicy tie and his purple
[SPEAKER_00]: tie and his original lines every four or
five years and kept fresh seed of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I wish he was interested in them and
didn't just let them go to shit even
[SPEAKER_00]: though he had them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I mean, everybody looks
back on when they were younger and was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, boy, do I wish I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who doesn't have those regrets
about their 20s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't even remember what
happened in my 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fucked up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these kind of Bible things are
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all getting documented in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eddie Leps was another place that was
kind of like Ron's parties or the Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible parties where people overlapped a
bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people wanted to come out and see
this guy is growing a thousand pounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: his front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a wild one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like it sucks because,
you know, what happened to him is he ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up going to jail for 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his wife ended up going to jail
for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see gardens way bigger than his
all over the place now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: People should know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't just go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did this crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably worth mentioning where.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law said you are allowed to have six
plants and a 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he mapped out his farm in 10 by 10
grids and he collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he collected medical cards for
each grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each medical card was tied to a
specific grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could give him your strains to
grow in that grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would do a certain amount of work
like feed it and water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you could come out there and do
your own daily thing and your own various
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put in more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to and really make your 10
by 10 nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was I don't need to get
into that part of it, but there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: split between him and you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, it's like he didn't just like
blow it up and go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He literally had 10 by 10 plots with six
plants per plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a medical card and he would just
stack hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just challenging the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: To challenge their own like little gray
areas of the law is what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty punk rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super rebellious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to have Eddie Lep gardens
all up and down the fucking the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He literally felt like most people
wouldn't be able to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why couldn't you come bring your
medical card to Eddie Lep's collective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grow your own fairly near your house
where you could go tend to your plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and what happened to him was he
he had this huge plot in his front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to dig him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some posters from him and a bunch of
pictures and stuff, but it's too hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: show like on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, he.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last year he had,
he decided to get seven acres across
[SPEAKER_00]: Highway 20 from his house in Upper Lake,
and he was going to grow about 13 acres of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty two thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All with all with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I begged him not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was like, dude, I don't think
the DEA, I don't think I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll let you get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm worried like they'll come down
and they'll bring the hammer down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some photos of that are in the Canna
Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole thing on Eddie in the
Canna Bible, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's definitely pictures
throughout the Canna Bibles that are from
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie's spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't recognize them if you
if you hadn't been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so I begged him not to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other friends begged him not to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was other people that thought
he'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were really pushing their
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were pushing it hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he got raided by the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost him a lot with thirty two thousand
plants, you know, and he he him and his
[SPEAKER_00]: wife got ten year sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten year federal federal sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shit, the shitty thing about
federal sentences is that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: serve 85 percent of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the state where you can get
off halfway for good behavior.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a Vietnam vet and him and his
wife were older.
[SPEAKER_00]: His wife passed away in prison,
sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the world had changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went from being this like rebel
maverick kind of center of attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, to be honest, he was kind of
egotistical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, you know, he tried to form a
cannabis church.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, he was fucking that's,
you know, a lot a lot of characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he got out and the world had changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's all these motherfuckers doing
gardens his size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he gave up, you know,
he gave up a lot for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got hammered pretty fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that I mean, I'll mention a
few people, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the one of the skittles crew that
like that spun off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dying breed now is his own person,
Shiloh, probably a bunch of people know I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like the second person in Mendo that
Shiloh met.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and Dallas, who's got, you know,
who he works with now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both were working at Eddie's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of people that became
kind of well known later.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind of Eddie's farm hands back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't the most organized character
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine, you know, he was
definitely king of his hill and he spent a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of time entertaining and being
himself, you know, and then you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow thousands of pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, and but we were
all young then a lot of us hadn't none of
[SPEAKER_00]: us had really made our names anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was all people that,
you know, it was just it was a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but Eddie had a bunch of parties at
his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a bunch of gatherings.
[SPEAKER_00]: At his house, a bunch of people from
Spyrock and Bell Springs would come down
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were shocked that he could.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did big shit up there, but they live
such a crazy lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could do it literally like you dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still I drive by his house pretty
often still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it from the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His old house that he lived at for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the house that's in the Canna
Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was like a who's who of
legalization guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should I should say something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, his last year's Jack Herrera
moved and got a house right down the
[SPEAKER_00]: street from Eddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passed by that house to Eddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Herrera was at a bunch of those
parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some signed books by him and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was over there a bunch just hanging
out, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he had he had some health
problem right there on the 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some health problems and some
strokes and stroke issues and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of his last year as he was,
you know, he kind of had like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sometimes some parts of your
face don't work the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his mind was still there, even though
sometimes he struggled to get out certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Jack is another hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a whole cannabis cup made after
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, you know, he wrote the book on the
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was it was kind of a it was
kind of a smaller world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was all those Ron's parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canna Bible parties, Eddie Lep's whole
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all sort of like a NorCal,
you know, Emerald Triangle, Lake County
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing that was going on where a
lot of people were starting to come off
[SPEAKER_00]: their heels and meet people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was pretty it was it was
pretty integral to what came later,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a lot of us that are our
middle age now and are trying to pass down
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking up to people like Eddie
Lep or Rob Clark or Tom Hill, who is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cantankerous old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he was a little nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to get him on here, but we'll
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a little he was a little nicer in
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, if he didn't know you and you
said something dumb on the Internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he was going to he was going to
eviscerate of your ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would rip it out of your asshole and
make you feel like the smallest little
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are saying there's very well there
might there's people saying, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have met you back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that you met me or I met you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a lot of comings and
goings then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at those parties at Ron's parties
like it's not like I got to meet and like
[SPEAKER_00]: made lasting relationships with everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 minute conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were in the tight circle of
people I was hanging out with all weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were on the periphery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just kind of one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of us were none of us were
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all just a bunch of young weed
nerds, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom was like, yeah, I agree, dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom was super nice to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you read some of this stuff when
people ask them dumb questions online and
[SPEAKER_00]: holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's he was highly intelligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, boo.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he was highly intelligent and he
didn't have a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I yeah, I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can definitely relate to that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but you see that you see that even
now, like you get so burnt out by dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with people, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the same thing happened to Sam
Scumman to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was probably nicer and more
chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get you have to answer the
same 50 questions a billion times and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get accused of all this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you're a cantankerous
old man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very easy to fall in that
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but those guys were all legends,
all heroes to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vic, Tom Hill, Hempsey, you know,
these were all like leaders of the scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and and old timers to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Tom's got to be I mean,
Tom's got to be 20 years older than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe maybe I don't maybe 50s.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think he's only in his 50s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I think you're pretty old,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're probably older than him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in your 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's all the oil of Olay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it keeps me young or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why I'm babbling about all
this shit is it's where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was essentially like there
was essentially like what's the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the best way to put it is that in
the 90s, most weed scenes were very
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated to themselves to very small
circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was illegal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was really chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead, Dead Tour, Fish Tour,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some overlapping things because
people would meet and not be scared
[SPEAKER_00]: because nobody knew where anybody else
lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but but, you know, I mean,
I'll say the same thing, too, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: just saw my buddy who I was talking to
earlier today skunked the skunked the A's
[SPEAKER_00]: on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Ron's party and I am so hoping to
meet all these legendary people and
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like just hoping to get hooked up,
you know, and not to be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I felt like I had the chem dog
and I had the super skunk and I had the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I had the best weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'd be the tour people's hat
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and, you know, it's not to
be bragging or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was literally just the luck of
the draw and the luck of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and Dead Tour, you know,
was one of those things where it was it
[SPEAKER_00]: was sort of like a huge weed emporium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made a lot of these connections and
it made a lot of these things that I tied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole reason I came out to
Mendocino County was because I had a buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: who lived in Ukiah, which is in the heart
of Mendo, who after two fifteen passed was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, dude, get the fuck out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you living in Chicago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was literally connections from Dead
Tour that like brought me out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to what I was saying is
that in northern California and in dead
[SPEAKER_00]: shows, there was a weed scene and on the
forums, it developed a weed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Emerald Triangle, there was
kind of a weed scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these parties and these events
and stuff was sort of like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: mixers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the first places where these
scenes started to like overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the forum scene and the Mendo and
Humboldt scenes and the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: scenes and all these different groups that
have ties to different circles,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start like a Venn diagram,
the circles start crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly think that's set up kind of
everything for the American weed scene for
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like none of us knew it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like we're like, oh,
we're here for history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was the merging of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I should say even back then,
this was a few years after Ron's parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, I mentioned the purple
effects that's in the that's in the Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should talk about that for a
second, because people might be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the purple the purple part of
purple effects is just Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effects was this old garlic bud
strain that I got from the head grower who
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for Tim Blake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Tim Blake now is very famous because
he's the founder of Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, he was just a big gorilla
outdoor indoor farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his his main worker was about my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave me the effects, which was a
super golden, gorgeous, frosty,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there wasn't any reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how the purple effects got made in the
Canna Bible is that I had a system that
[SPEAKER_00]: got a little stressed because I had an air
conditioner issue and it took me a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days to get it fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as CSI will tell you,
you stress the Mendo perps and the fucker
[SPEAKER_00]: will hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Mendo perps hermed all over the
effects that was right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and a buddy got about a thousand
seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight hundred to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the time, we were hella pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we got that many was
because we had like these six or seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, quarter pound, six ounce,
you know, effects plants all around it
[SPEAKER_00]: that we couldn't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chock full of fucking seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cracked this thing and it ends up
being super terpy, you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ended up in the Canna Bible was
gorgeous weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I should say that there's
been some battles amongst the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of that weed exists still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it in a bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of that weed exists still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in it's in the rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the sprite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got passed around at some of Tim
Blake's early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people should know that Tim
Blake had this spot called Area 101 in
[SPEAKER_00]: north of Laytonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he threw a bunch of weed events up
there and he threw a bunch of like
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially like weird raves and different
kinds of like musical gatherings and and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of like a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the first half a dozen
emerald cups were all super local events
[SPEAKER_00]: held there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I passed out a bunch of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a gentleman that used to work up
there and used to work at Reggae a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: called Fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not his real name, but that's his
nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and all that and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he ended up getting the
purple effects for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who the Tony Mendo and those
guys got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got blended into Skittles and it
got got all these different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it lives today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a total that was before
Femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was literally an unintentional fuck
up where in summertime, the AC went out
[SPEAKER_00]: for two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it got hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put a new AC in and everything
was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Mendo P just threw through
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had and I had a feminized cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are asking, what about California
Black Rose?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened to them is like a lot of
cannabis terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose is trademarked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose is a very specific kind of wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also another seed company that
has a totally different line called Rose
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relentless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not related to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's related to the same
dying group one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't quote me now that I think about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to change it because they got
because as you get legal and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: entering these things and stuff,
you start getting sued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Girl Scout Cookies and Thin Mint
is cookies because they got fucking sued
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Girl Scouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the reason why Skittles has
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is they're trying to skate
around these these trademark laws.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rose is Russian OG crossed with
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossed the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took second place, I don't know,
three, four years ago or whatever at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I got out of them and this one's
been I think I have a screenshot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Russian Kush, Oz Kush effects
crossed back to Skittles is the claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had the seeds that they had were
purple effects seeds from from fuzzy that
[SPEAKER_00]: was from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because back then it was like there wasn't
any I mean, in the same time frame,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say this, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, my buddy from me and Skunk
VA's old friend who with the cams and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, we were working on these Superdog
projects together and crossing them to all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of different hybrids and clone only
as we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy Mandelbrot at the time who
wasn't into seeds or breeding wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: get started with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up giving him a bunch of seeds
and a bunch and some clones to get him
[SPEAKER_00]: started on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ended up becoming pretty well
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff he got famous for was
based off that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it was a little different from
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the the reason I brought that up isn't
to like lay claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to say that back then we were very
free with trading things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because no one ever thought that
they could come out of the woodwork and
[SPEAKER_00]: lay claim to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't breed with my cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want Matt knows this more than me
because I've avoided so far a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed politics by giving away a bunch of
seeds for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you sell seeds like Matt,
you end up getting, you know, I want half
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds because you use my cut in this
one cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to mention me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to give me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have permission jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so many blow jobs I've had to give
just because of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, you know, I mean,
do what you love, do what you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's what I'm good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, so there, you know,
there's an aspect of politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this was before that politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just swap seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just swapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people just swapped cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: People swapped, you know, all this
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, you know, you didn't want
your name attached to weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then they'd fucking find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'd be you'd get you'd get in
fucking you'd get you'd get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want anything named after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and now now it's come full
circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one hundred and eighty degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like someone's like,
I didn't breed this cut, but I did make it
[SPEAKER_00]: famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, if you're making any money,
off it, you must give me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule of the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's in my terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all three and all this different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just like those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's even like, you know,
people were asking way earlier on the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I have to sign a disclosure for
D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: came up with all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way fucking later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, there was no at the time,
there was no I mean, people should give
[SPEAKER_00]: credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I just saw a homie
mention that people should give credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should say that I got this from this
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you also should.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a cut from somebody,
you should give it back to them if they
[SPEAKER_00]: lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good etiquette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've had multiple things that
I've lost and I've tried to get back from
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of them that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get it back without trading other
things for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think is super shady and a breach
of the code, at least the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came up, you're definitely supposed
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some half the reason people trade
things is so you don't lose things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because angry girlfriend, angry boyfriend,
bust, fire, landlord, moving accident,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, all those different
types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you trade things back amongst
people, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the reasons, you know,
I'll say this because he's because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: listening or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, one of the reasons why the
chem 91 didn't get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was because there was a tight group of,
you know, four or five of us, myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk, the I.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: collective, my buddy from Staten Island,
who all had it and all lived in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we all kept it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people, sometimes people got in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people still had to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you had to get it back from
somebody or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like we were all heavily
invested in making sure these things
[SPEAKER_00]: lived.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, I mean, that's that's why
a lot of these cuts are still in our
[SPEAKER_02]: group, you know, like in our tight circle,
because, you know, we all move around,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he said he's just saying,
I'll just say I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to keep thinking because I keep
wanting to say as name, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, I have a hard time bullshitting
at pace and reading comments at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he, you know, you know,
there were some people that lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my whole name, you know,
he just said that I had to give I.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: back the cut like five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my whole name not so dog is because
our buddy from Staten Island drove up to
[SPEAKER_00]: see I.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: collective and got a bag of dog and
brought it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't the dog because dude was
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude used to party and he got mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mixed up his clones and he grew a
whole room of Ken Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like Romulan or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get it to him back because he
was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be, you know, like now,
dude, it's not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to call him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And homie was all excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I've never seen it look like
this, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, the reason why you said I
had stuck my head in the bag because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the car with Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told it before and I looked up and I'm
like, it's not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about you're tripping,
you know, and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I went today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good because, you know,
they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they used to be best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm lucky, you know, there's and
there's aspects to stories I always leave
[SPEAKER_00]: out because they're personal and I don't
think they're super pertinent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just stoked for us because I
want to get both those motherfuckers on
[SPEAKER_02]: here at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool to get homie to get to
come talk because a lot of the story
[SPEAKER_00]: people should know and the people are
like, oh, not so it wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, that, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stories I have, you know,
come from Staten Island or come from Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: VA talking to them 20 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the forums, before the fame,
before he got on and got his handle,
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk VA, you know, before the cut was
getting traded when it was just our little
[SPEAKER_00]: crew that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, honestly, like they don't come
from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from my memory of like what I
remember about sitting around,
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting the shit and growing weed and and
doing shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would be it would be a really
neat thing to do both to bridge that gap
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two of them and get them to
talk back and forth, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've been trying to get
dude on here for a long time, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get Skunk VA to he's just so
sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of he's kind of he's kind of
prickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, him and I were him and I were,
you know, me and and him and and Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all known each other a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's certain point,
you know, you bury the hatchet about
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's hard being in weed and having
all these like interpersonal, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mix business and friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and people have different
memories about shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, it but yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke to I right before the show,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk VA and I were talking about chatting
back and forth a bunch via text about some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a ray of hope on something
that we maybe thought was long lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's if it's so developed,
I'll report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what that's what we try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like old friends trying to look out
for one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only make it through this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the people are much more
important at the end at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: than the money or the fame or the
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm I'm big into people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I need enough money to survive,
you know, but I'm big into people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's I like to see my friends
doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see and we've all you know,
all of us are like semi autistic weed
[SPEAKER_00]: nerds in some way or whatever,
you know, and like you it's odd,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, living alone or living by your,
you know, living amongst you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: small groups of people and living weed and
taking a bunch of risks and staying secret
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like me showing my face is fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now I show up weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you know, so I just I just
thought it would be it would be cool
[SPEAKER_00]: because this era is like right before kind
of Matt came into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is like I apologize because I keep
trying to get shows done where I make it
[SPEAKER_00]: like more Matt's era than mine because
there's a smaller era.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an era where like, you know,
I was having a bunch of kids and had some
[SPEAKER_00]: issues or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and Matt was super engaged when I was
a little less engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, you know, I'm going to drag
him kicking and screaming into his era
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's mostly him talking and me
shutting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he keeps making us do these things
where it's it's a little older stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I think it's a lot,
too, because I've been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the live feed for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for this many years,
I think people are more excited to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: from someone else for a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited to hear like from an era I
wasn't a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think nobody gives a fuck to hear
what I have to say about something I
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's it's it's not just about
my ego on this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good to get all aspects of
history on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a thing,
too, where it's like I mean, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know back in the day that the chem dog was
going to become super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it stayed alive because our buddy
from Staten Island used to take it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you could meet him outside of any
Jerry show outside the war field and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably buy a four hundred dollar ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, you know, all that you
could, you know, when when Jerry Garcia
[SPEAKER_00]: died, you know, and he decided to and,
you know, Skunk VA came back to
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he got cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started he started growing because
all of a sudden he was settled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't traveling and seeing shows and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where some of his Polaroids
come from of that old skunk cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, a small group of
us were growing the dog and we were always
[SPEAKER_00]: we called it, you know, no one called the
Chem 91 and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all like later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all called it the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Skunk VA and our buddy from
Staten Island, they mostly grew organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't want to call their weed
chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't going to call it the chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that picture, I think that picture
of the super skunk for me, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm interested in is one of the
most important pictures that anybody could
[SPEAKER_02]: have kept that and some of the Josh D.O.G.
pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those are specifically the sour
picture and pictures of sour pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old super skunk super, super fucking
important for solving that weird mystery
[SPEAKER_02]: of like, was this super skunk cut the same
as the original super skunk cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a thing to like part of
the, you know, we don't need to go over it
[SPEAKER_00]: again, but we'll talk about it just really
briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about like Ron's parties and
these and the triangle and the dead scene
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole reason that the Francine
got taken out east and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the super skunk came west and all that
stuff was all because of Jerry shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend and Skunk VA were at and
friends of his from back east.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smoking weed together at the show and
then people wanting that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't need to, you know,
I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to tell that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, that's that's he's told
that story pretty eloquently and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is it is showing how those circles
overlapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and one led to the other and
stuff like that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's lock in Skunk VA for next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next Friday, Skunk VA will be on and he
will be happy to be performing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he said I don't know if we
locked him in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we did, we're going to chat again
this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have a line on something I
thought was long lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dear to both of our hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying my damnedest to make sure I
can get it back to all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I do believe I'm not
particularly superstitious, but I do
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in it and the energy of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe in the universe a bit
like making things come to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say for everyone out there,
for me, at least the number one way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the cuts that you want and you get
the things that you want in cannabis is by
[SPEAKER_00]: treating the plant the right way and
having the right intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I say, because that that's
going to a long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to get the right people to
trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to lead to what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe the plant has an energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe the plant wants to wants
to, you know, wants to find people that
[SPEAKER_00]: will keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no I can't prove it, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that there's collectors out
there and the plant hides in places where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hoping that someone cares about it
and isn't just monetarily attached to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a lot of the things that I
have, I wouldn't have because I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten rid of them as soon as they were
unpopular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I personally liked them and cared
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's friends of mine that feel
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they have their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's a general thing among our
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a theme, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get it's like you get trusted
in circles and you know, maybe we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect of like authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were going to talk about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are kind of getting an hour and
a half into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we can talk a little bit about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's there's aspects of things
where now that I'm being public.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm starting to tell some of these
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say that there's a lot of things
that maybe like five or 10 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed community knows pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where how do you let the other 90 percent
know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of like accepted facts
among small groups of people that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: trade this kind of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to get it out there and
you get fucking attacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, Matt can attest that he
tried to get me to do this for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, well, I mean, you were just
watching what happened to me and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb's event up in up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was like I showed my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in front of a huge crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I didn't give my real
name, but it's still time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it comes down to is that if what
convinced me to do it is is like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't try to get some version of the truth
out there, what you believe to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth, then it's just going to be
overwhelmed by bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect where it's like and
I really get upset about it sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's this I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where people pile on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Matt's a villain on I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be to a lot of but to a lot of
people that don't know him in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if we want to fast forward a
bit before Covid, Matt and I, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: other friends that helped and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to just to diss anyone
I'm not mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Matt and I and a few other friends
kind of like got this idea to throw what
[SPEAKER_00]: we called like the can Illuminati party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of kind of based on Ron's
old parties and some of those old
[SPEAKER_00]: gatherings, but more modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to do it the same weekend
as Emerald Cup, you know, because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody would be in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we rented a huge house and invited a
bunch of people over on Friday and
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday night of Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both years, you know, we had hundreds
of people come to the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, nobody punched
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think nobody attacked Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that you that you
you don't imagine that like respect him a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't punch me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a bunch of collectors and breeders
and weed nerds and people in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that come through and want to hang out
with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to realize that like we were
trying to throw an event where it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys spend all day at their fucking
booth talking to customers and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: give their customers a little bit of one
on one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at night time, you know,
they get to come out and hang with a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of people just like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trade weed amongst people just like
them and shoot the shit and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trade cuts and talk about bullshit and do
all this various shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really had a good time those
couple of years before Covid fucked it all
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, you know, we had a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, you know, CSI and Bodie and kind
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was hundreds of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody, but a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people were busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're burned out or whatever,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were trying to recreate some of
those like more innocent time parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, you know, and I
brought tons of weed and various friends
[SPEAKER_00]: brought tons of weed and we just have like
a huge table full of jars that were
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled and anybody could freely smoke
whatever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even even like just like the forums,
there was a bunch of friends I made on IG
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of the first time they smoked
the headband, some of the first time they
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked the real chem D, some of the first
time they smoked this different stuff was
[SPEAKER_00]: at these parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might hear you talk about it,
but they don't actually see your week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then they get a chance to do
it and then you get to share a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: your weed with friends and you get to do
all these different kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that part is really neat because
that kind of I wish you went to do we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have another one after Covid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's you know, it's just like
a who's who.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of people that have been around for a long
time and you would not believe how little
[SPEAKER_00]: beef there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was none.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't any beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was smoking out, eating a bunch of
food, having a great time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trading beans, trading cuts, making
connections, putting faces to names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have an aspect where we've had
some issues this week where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start having these talks week by week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, Matt's a bit of a villain
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because now I'm coming out and we
haven't even hit some of the controversial
[SPEAKER_00]: topics yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I'm coming out and talking about
stuff, you start getting enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start getting people that are annoyed
that people are listening to you or
[SPEAKER_00]: believe your version of events or,
you know, on IG or on various discords.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to, like, disparage your
character and say you weren't around and
[SPEAKER_00]: say that you didn't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your weed was shared or your seeds suck
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, like it becomes really hard
because a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: listening, you don't know the person
you're siding with and you don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: person that you're against in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in an honest real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it becomes hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do you make stuff happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was people that were
accusing me this week of not even see the
[SPEAKER_00]: chems until 08.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then I came out of nowhere
and then all my stories are lies and not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just means the stories are not so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's let's be fair, though,
like that the people that were doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: were people that were in the outer circle
of our friend group and never made it
[SPEAKER_02]: quite on the in circle because they were
they were bad people and they fucked
[SPEAKER_02]: people over or they did certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt will come out and say,
this person's a scammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's stealing cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to fuck you over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that person and like and some
bots and like a bunch of fake accounts and
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of people that bought seeds all
attack Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's a faggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Jew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He I got a Nazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Nazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a Jewish Nazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these various things are getting
attacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I become a public figure a
little bit like they start attacking,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, is that that party is weed sucks this
and that everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fine people to throw barbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even saying you should trust
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I am saying is that, you know,
weed has a lot of people lived in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we're doing a bunch of
these stories is because we want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: oral history out there and we want to do
it in a conversational fashion that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't bore you to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that steps on toes and then
people are furious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can't fuck with the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so they'll fuck with Matt or they'll
fuck with me or they'll say you're a liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, oh, I know for a fact he didn't
touch Kam until after oh eight or he
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have this or his this.
[SPEAKER_00]: His headband is watered down or whatever
they want to say about Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the seven oh seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, and it's like you
don't want to spend all your life fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: like refuting a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's like everybody that
knows me knows me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and Matt and vice versa,
you know, and so we're trying to get truth
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get truth that like we're
not making any money off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of these a lot of these
podcasts are like weed infomercials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's three hours of why you should buy
my seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk extensively about you and why
you're great and why you're integral to
[SPEAKER_00]: the story and why you're a cannabis
historian and why you're so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to help you make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I should have been inserting myself
into all this old shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and it's like you do need,
you know, we do plug for two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes some stuff that Matt's doing or,
you know, CSI or different people at
[SPEAKER_00]: times, because there is a financial
element to like making all this different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of stuff work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what it is, is that now that
I'm old and I'm in my mid 40s or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 60s, there might be people that are
23 that want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it might be 40 and want to hear the
real truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually you just have to
decide because there are some real
[SPEAKER_00]: scumbags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just come out and insert themselves
and then rely on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you speak up, I'll blow up your fucking
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it really worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll attack and attack and attack and
attack and I'll fuck you over and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make your life miserable for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shut the fuck up about what you all
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much of that, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming from so many fucking angles
like is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a headache and it's rife for
sociopaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rife for shade balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beans have always been shady and they're
not getting any less shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're just not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's but there's but there's a
bunch of us, you know, who had been around
[SPEAKER_00]: long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's this running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to call them out or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I don't even it was like a super
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like me and Skunk, we were talking
about whether or not we were going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to these like dead shows in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's telling me he's like,
man, because he was he's he's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: older than me and he was on tour for
longer than I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has more connections than I do,
to be perfectly frank, because he's about
[SPEAKER_00]: six or seven years older than me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was like, dude, we could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's like, then I'm going to see this
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know he doesn't pay his child
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to see this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he owes my friend 15 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see this other guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and you know, these people's
backstories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, you're going to see
some people you're like so stoked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to see some other
people and you're just like, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: why can't you be cooler?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of a shitbag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay your kids, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay your child support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay my buddy back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ripped him off when you were down and
out, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes on in Weedworld.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what city?
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, at the time, both him and I
lived in northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were we were thinking about going
down to SF and catching some shows at
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain View or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's the thing is like a
lot of times I'll talk about things and
[SPEAKER_00]: like a general sense, because you start
calling out individual people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next week of my life is
fucking that asshole trying to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and blowing themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and homie, Matt and I and me and
scum here, we know a lot of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of it is not all of it is
beneficial to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can't, you know, it doesn't
pay to spend your whole life trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: warn the fam unity about Jack off because
it's whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I tried that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just it did not pay off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is it was detrimental to my career.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say I don't recommend people do
that for any reason whatsoever if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: an interest in being successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I so yeah, you know,
I mean, there's there's that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not saying trust me or trust
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying, like, if you're giving us your
time every Friday night and you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to us at length and ask questions and
stuff, eventually you have to maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hear enough of things that you get a
general sense of who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: is an image and that sociopaths are very,
very good at curating an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they do best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and yet someone just said
nobody's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't, you know, people aren't
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even trying to judge people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm not calling anybody out by
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just saying a general I'm just
saying a general state of events.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have someone I was going to call out
by name, but it's it's getting late.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's one more big thing I want to I
want to get put aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually using their words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not going to say it's not even a
big enough deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll just be funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be someone I've looked up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you were about to do or you're
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I still need some of the the
details.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want it just to be my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it to be a dude's own words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, and that's kind of what we talk
about, like when people are like the can
[SPEAKER_00]: Illuminati, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The can Illuminati is not like some kind
of organization or membership.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no dues, you know, that there's no
one that controls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it basically means is that you're
enough of a weed head that you care enough
[SPEAKER_00]: of the history to hold on to strains,
to hold on to seeds, to want to dig for
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talk to other people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically it's a it's a like minded
group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know who each other are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, even amongst that group,
there's not even really trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's just like, dude, like once,
you know, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk VA and I were talking earlier today
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we're not going to trade
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like it's like, oh, you need a couple
of these and I can get you this or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not like a trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more just like, you know,
you're sort of what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think there's anything
wrong with trading because trading is
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly acceptable, especially if you
don't know each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you've been personal friends for
a couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just friends helping friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a lot of the ways that this
stuff exists like, you know, our history,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really why I'm chatting is because
I don't want all of our history to be
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I want it to be out there in some kind
of form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost all oral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with a lot of the forums going down
over the years, whether it be from the
[SPEAKER_02]: feds, you know, getting a hold of the
ICMAG server to, you know, Pana
[SPEAKER_02]: Collective, Pot Pimp, any of the the the C
Depot, any of those that have gone down,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had a lot of information on them like
C Depot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people that people look at
today is old school heroes and whatnot or
[SPEAKER_02]: really trustworthy people all popped up on
C Depot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their whole history is gone because
that's that site was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude disappeared after fucking
everyone over the owned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's in a lot of people's memories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really the only chance we have
to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just we're just trying to
we're just trying to like regurgitate
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and get it out there and get
different versions of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, like like anything,
you know, some of these stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's people that have different
memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's people that have different
versions, even like the three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were there might not tell the
same tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were the ones that were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I got a nickname for being a power
bottom at the last party, and I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: sure I was power top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I mean, it's cool because
then you get then you get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these parties, these gatherings and stuff,
they really are bonds.
They're bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they really are where human
connections are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to smoke a bunch of your good
friends weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see them in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to hear what their voice sounds
like and hear them laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to break bread and food with
people, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to share weed and share
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's, you know,
what maybe we can get the candle and
[SPEAKER_00]: candle Illuminati parties together again
now that Covid seems to be dying down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of people that are either
been infected or vaccinated, and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: so much like the plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was for a few years where it was
shutting shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those kind of gatherings are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so tonight, you know, we're almost at
two hours, so I'll probably shut up here
[SPEAKER_00]: in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to give like a general
random overview of some of the overlapping
[SPEAKER_00]: things that were happening in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really set the stage for
everything that came after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really where a lot of
friendships were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was where a lot of trading and a lot of
seed exchange was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was where a lot of cuttings and a lot
of people smoking other people's weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: learning happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of those guys ended up
becoming super well known in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it it it, you know,
but you don't know it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's that's the funny thing about
history is you don't know if you're if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making it, you don't know,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but really what it boils down to is
we're all just people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Care about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some of us care about rap and money
and and and, you know, scamming people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a big conflict between those
two right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the community, there's been one for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's gotten more public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, even like, you know,
Matt's been doxxed before, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even some of those comments I was
referencing that we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were saying my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I cared to some degree,
because it's you know, like I'm showing my
[SPEAKER_00]: face every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Principle of the thing, though,
you're not saying your Christian name
[SPEAKER_00]: every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not saying my Christian name every
week or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so, you know, but but what's
funny about that is that I can use that
[SPEAKER_00]: later to prove something that will like
blow them up in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been pushed enough enough times
by this human being to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just so it sucks to have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because they're saying such extreme
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there are only a few things in life
that I take for personal is when you talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about your friends, family or you call me
a fucking Nazi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I spent my whole young life just
literally fist fighting Nazis and being
[SPEAKER_02]: punched by them many, many, many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take it very seriously when someone
accuses me of such things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a Jewish Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not there's not too many Nazi
Jews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so anyway, Matt, if you want to do
your plug, because we're almost two hours
[SPEAKER_00]: here or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Breeders Syndicate
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way to find it is to go to Google and
type in Breeders Syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to Patreon and type in Breeders
Syndicate, it's not going to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is a pot channel and you cannot
search pot channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to Google, type in Breeders
Syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow I'm going to be watching fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to, you know, hang out and do
some fight watching, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the Santa Cruz Goat Farm Fem
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reversed Arcada train wreck lines for
sale right now on the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My boy packs a fucking killer dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made some killer things,
including the Santa Cruz Blue Dream train
[SPEAKER_02]: wreck, which I'm really, really stoked to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have me and CSI's Hawaii Lights
drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to make the Hawaii Lights
hybrids public so everybody can fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: join in and grab that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check out SpeakEasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do all the editing of the podcast and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go give them support and follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just say one thing after Matt did
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're getting up to 200,
230, 250 people a week now doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: every every Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for taking time out of your
night to bullshit with us and ask
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.

[SPEAKER_00]: He's been improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're approving people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've literally approved like 1500 people
this week and it keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to get approved,
send me a message and I'll see it and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do it faster for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone, I really appreciate you
giving us your some part of your Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to try to get more topics
and more history out there and keep it
