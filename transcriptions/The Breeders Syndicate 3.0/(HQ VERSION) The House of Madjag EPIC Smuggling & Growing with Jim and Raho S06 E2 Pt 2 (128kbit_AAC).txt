[SPEAKER_01]: to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total gentleman's contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't enforce it, no way to do it,
but it's just a simple handshake deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the idea for this from another
YouTuber named Jesse on fire, and I felt
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was fair for him to ask,
so I figured I'd do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honor system reengaged in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene, researching everything
from cannabis strain history, old
[SPEAKER_01]: smuggling tales from the first-person
perspective, to breeding science and news
[SPEAKER_01]: on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_01]: Natsodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be part two of the Mad
Jag and Rojo series.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, joined here by my friend,
Natsodon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, everybody, we really had a good
time recording the show last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was probably the largest
response we've ever gotten for any show as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as the positivity that we received.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, really resonated with a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'm really excited to start with
round two, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to go in a more linear pattern
and we covered some of the canyon era.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know after we recorded last time,
we spoke a little bit and you have some
[SPEAKER_01]: notes and a good direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to let you go ahead and
start, Mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you want to start the tale?
[SPEAKER_04]: The 1978 map that I drew, it says OG,
stands for Original Garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the 1978 map.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to explain it a little bit and
break it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the key is at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is before skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the very first.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a friend in Kauai who had Oaxacan
Hawaiian crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the H10, H9, HK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had somehow a few Thai seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Colombian came from my friend and
they're the ones that on Thanksgiving
[SPEAKER_04]: while it was snowing above us on the rim
weren't even close to being finished.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was the layout of that garden that
you showed photos of last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so well, it's surrounded by pine trees
and lots of heavy dark green brush.
[SPEAKER_04]: This garden was probably I'm thinking 100
feet long and 50 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from the old notebooks that you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was drawn like at the time you were
drawing this as you were looking on or how
[SPEAKER_01]: did it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year I did one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was at the middle part of our canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: The subsequent years, 80, 79, 80 and 81
were about two or three miles further up
[SPEAKER_04]: the canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one was closer to 1800 feet down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a longer hike, more difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the others were anywhere from 14 to
1600 feet down in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes a difference at the end of the
year, of course, when you're carrying your
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we did as much as possible down
inside the canyon later by having friends
[SPEAKER_04]: come down in and camp with us because it
wasn't feasible to carry out whole plants
[SPEAKER_04]: or branches or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find that any of these grew any
different in these little microclimates in
[SPEAKER_01]: the canyon, like any of these strains from
like 78 between 78 and 79.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you moved or grew any of the same exact
strains in different locations in the
[SPEAKER_01]: canyon, did you find any phenotypic
variations?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was just more the size and
ripeness because this particular garden
[SPEAKER_04]: was got the sun east to west.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had the most sun in 10, 11 hours that
some days, you know, in the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they grew much larger plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're some of these plants were
13, 14 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend, my partner is six foot seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a photo of him reaching up in in
his wizard outfit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: His reach is at nine feet and they're four
or five feet beyond his reach.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, they were the Hawaiians.
[SPEAKER_04]: H 10 over here where it says H 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you go right, let's see right
over in this region, H 10 left of this
[SPEAKER_04]: photo or this drawing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and also in the middle there,
H 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: They they were just massive plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was good smoke, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Will Hocken again crossed with
whatever they were calling Hawaiian,
[SPEAKER_04]: which has a Thai background just because
Hawaii probably in the 40s and 50s,
[SPEAKER_04]: people from the Far East that visited
there, that it'd be very easy to see those
[SPEAKER_04]: sorts of varieties showing up in another
tropical area.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crazy magic because I used to,
you know, I drew a plot like this for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a map like this for just about
every outdoor plot I ever did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy to see, you know,
that two people on, you know, other sides
[SPEAKER_00]: of the country at the same time are doing
the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, beyond the fact that I did
it, yours is the level of detail and
[SPEAKER_00]: artistry is way beyond anything I ever
did, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I might want to ask,
just because I remember something you
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned last time, which was basically
like you kind of averaged about six point
[SPEAKER_03]: eight or seven ounces of plant or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just heard you say that like
you had these nine to 13 foot tall plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: these giants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you could talk a little bit about
some of the different stuff that you grew
[SPEAKER_03]: was a nine or was a nine foot or 10 foot
tall plant only giving you that amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: flower because of how loose it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have some that were a lot denser
and they were smaller plants but yielded
[SPEAKER_03]: more?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have old timers that would tell
me that back in the day, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would get ounces that were like the
size of my forearm just because the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't as dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm curious as to like,
was the six point eight ounces,
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff that happened in subsequent
years when you were doing like the skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: one, did you get a massive variance of
weights and sizes these first couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: years when you were experiencing them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: The six point eight ounces average across
the entire two gardens that we did later
[SPEAKER_04]: were all, almost all skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the tallest plants were six,
seven, eight feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Hawaiian in this particular
drawing that were so tall, they were
[SPEAKER_04]: multi-pound plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have a scale at the time down in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the later years, we brought a dialygram
down, Ohaus, good old dialygram.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would go up to two pounds, I think,
I forget.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this plant in particular, it was
obviously pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were tight buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They aren't rock buds, you know,
like some, especially the ones I know of
[SPEAKER_04]: friends who grow heavily Indica
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those buds just get rock hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Density is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dried.
[SPEAKER_04]: These, a pound of this herb probably was
twice the size of the later skunk number
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The skunk number one were denser,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a quick question that I've just
been, as going through the pictures and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, which wizard were you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which color?
[SPEAKER_04]: We all pointed it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you?
[SPEAKER_04]: This was not me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was my friend, Doug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six to seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: The light blue one was my UK partner that
you have in a photo where he's pointing
[SPEAKER_04]: off in, well, actually you used it in this
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's pointing out into the distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: The garden is actually right below him,
but we had him pointing in a direction
[SPEAKER_04]: that wouldn't be as easy to figure out if
you got to that canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was never, I never wore the light
blue one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think it was a smaller robe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a, oh, what is the one I'm
wearing?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one of me and my tall partner
walking across the rug.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is the white one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you got it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the one in front.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can just see my beard back then
showing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: My ex-wife, my kid's mom, she's the one
who sewed these up for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: She made all of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that red bag there was particularly
colorful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she was up with the idea, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know whatever happened to these
costumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't keep at least one around,
but I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 years later, you know, it's what really
pulled me to your story when I first like
[SPEAKER_01]: I first, like I said, heard about or even
like found out what Madjag was going
[SPEAKER_01]: through Sam's old posts and going through
the kilo art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept seeing this really pretty kilo
art that said Madjag on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what started that journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I saw these pictures of the
robes is when I was like, these are my
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to find out who they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That log right there that we're walking
across.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a storm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was camped on the side that this photo
was taken from.
[SPEAKER_04]: By our third friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And water was almost touching the bottom
of this this log.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to sit on it and scoot across
with a bag of weed in front of me and
[SPEAKER_04]: scoot across.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ran for like three days from this
massive fall storm, like in October.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a good thing that thing was
there, or else I would have been stuck on
[SPEAKER_04]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as it was, I was in a silly old army
tent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And water was had didn't have a built in
bottom and the water was flowing through
[SPEAKER_04]: the pouring rain and cut a trench around
it like you do in Boy Scouts to funnel the
[SPEAKER_04]: water away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wilderness experience that,
you know, MJ, you remember last week we
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about how the how growing
these plants kind of turns you into an
[SPEAKER_00]: instant young entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inspiration, you know,
I've often wondered, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of what what were your
intentions, you know, when you guys came
[SPEAKER_00]: up with this whole Mad Jag branding idea
and started sending stuff into high times?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what was what was going through
your head when you were when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: starting that thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks it looks like, you know,
early viral marketing stuff is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, viral didn't even exist that term,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were inspired by High Times magazine by
the Growers Guide and then later Robert
[SPEAKER_04]: Clark's book.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seemed like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make our own legend, you know,
and maybe someday we'll be doing a movie
[SPEAKER_04]: about it or it was it was kind of with
that in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that it would make us richer and
we would get paid more for the herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just it was set us apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we went and had labels made
the crack and peel labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be glad to send you guys some because
I've kept a lot of them over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They they still work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would I would go through like an
airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I was going up the escalator
and I had one cracked and open.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just slapped it open.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the side of the paper magazine
dispenser in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of my friends, the guy in in
Tempe, his brother, who was a bigger
[SPEAKER_04]: dealer even than he said, Did you put one
of your stickers in the airport in L.A.?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not on the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that reminds me so much of like early
skateboarding culture, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that was, you know, some of the
earliest kind of viral marketing,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, viral marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that they that they pioneered
back then in skateboarding with
[SPEAKER_00]: skateboarder magazine, you know,
is is absolutely the foundation of of
[SPEAKER_00]: viral Internet marketing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, social media influencers,
all that stuff has roots going directly
[SPEAKER_00]: back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of that in your magic
stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of that like in the Hayes
poster, the Cosmic Boogie poster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was like why I chased that
so hard was because as a person who sells
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and has made that my passion
breeding and all that, to me, that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time that I could find a physical,
tangible representation or something I
[SPEAKER_01]: could possess that was a perfect example
of the first strain marketing that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: find, you know, and and the magic label,
I put it in that same kind of category.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those early things,
striking imagery that you never forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was done so well, but I never
forgot it and always chased it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost it's almost like a pre-Reagan
era of freedom where everyone thought
[SPEAKER_03]: things were about to loosen up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they were kind of loose for a
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they went in a totally different
direction for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 more years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these old posters that you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found them a few times and I never
bought one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's an old poster where it's like
they made them declaring like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally did it, you know, like
prohibitions over posters, but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I'm curious about and like the
actual growing part of it is since it
[SPEAKER_03]: sounds like you were basically this first
season, you were just collecting seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: from friends and people you could get
access to.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were the things that you liked and
disliked about the first crop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, did you look at those things when
you were trying to get away with it and
[SPEAKER_03]: you were like, oh, my God, this 13 foot
plant is blowing past all the bushes and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else that we were trying to
contain it and like make it look like it
[SPEAKER_03]: was normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to do that giant again
because it it makes me nervous or like
[SPEAKER_03]: what was the what were the thoughts there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously, like this is the first
time that you were seeing a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: things grown, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what to expect,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you just this is what Hawkin and this
is why and this is this and this is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was kind of like plant spacing and
how big they were going to get and what
[SPEAKER_03]: they were going to do was all kind of a
mystery, I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we were.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had had the one year before this with my
dealer friend from Tempe in a neighboring
[SPEAKER_04]: canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the first time I got a chance
to see plants actually reach harvest time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were all Mexican strains,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the next over the next year,
the next year, we tried a garden in that
[SPEAKER_04]: canyon that was massive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to get a we had to pump up 200 feet
to the alluvial plateau.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had found and it wasn't really smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing it failed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a submersible pump that weighed
like 40 pounds and hosed going up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first time we watered,
we laid a hose on the ground and it just
[SPEAKER_04]: went.
[SPEAKER_04]: It disappeared into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it this morning?
[SPEAKER_04]: We moved it another 50 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just made a hole and went down in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't flood irrigate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so loose with boulders and stuff
below, even though it was this beautiful,
[SPEAKER_04]: smooth garden on top that it it just
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like dredging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the following year, we had
collected all these other seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: Thai, Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we and I knew from that very first
year how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just went on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: These the Colombian, though, that we had
no idea like we discovered that how long
[SPEAKER_04]: it took to finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just knew it was super great weed that
we had smoked and we kept the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these on this garden, I'd say 30
percent of it failed because it was just
[SPEAKER_04]: it wasn't ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the garden that's up here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Showing us the year you're speaking about
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this one is 1980.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's we were looking at the 78 earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had the key at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one are you speaking about
currently?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one that I want to get the original
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1978.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gee.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the one that 30 percent failed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by failed, you mean to mean just
didn't finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were huge plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one photo that he has from last
episode, they were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants in slightly different colors
because they were different Colombian
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the C10 here, C9, wherever the sea
shows up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were big, big plants that make it
easier to see right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I zoom out, it might be too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so eventually, did you just end up
having to chop them down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you just and and you just realized
they weren't done, they weren't they
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't real weed yet and kind of
composted them down there?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we took them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the ones that I had to scoot
across that folder with in a bag once we
[SPEAKER_04]: cut them down to branch size.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were the size of my little
fingertip buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were kind of tight and nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we sold them, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: They they were just a very mild smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: They they had resin, but not not like they
would have been super killer weed if
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd gotten a month and a half more or
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the end of December or early January,
like they would in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me let me maybe ask you this,
because I didn't I don't think we talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about this last time in the area that you
were in.
[SPEAKER_03]: What month or around what date was it safe
to plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what was kind of like the latter
part of your harvest window where after
[SPEAKER_03]: that it was cold and rainy and you were in
fear of losing it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And luckily, those giant Hawaiian plants,
they because they were Oaxacan crosses,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were ready in October and like no
later than mid October, I'd say probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rains and cold didn't really hit
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: October traditionally in Arizona is the
second driest month of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: June is the driest October.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has changed since then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had a beautiful fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So down in the canyon had cool nights,
but the days would be warm and nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just we harvested everything out of
this camp, out of this garden,
[SPEAKER_04]: except those Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were going back and watering them
and back and watering them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, on Thanksgiving, when it was
snowing up above and we had to go out on
[SPEAKER_04]: the mesas in inches of snow and big clods
of mud on our feet, it was just we decided
[SPEAKER_04]: we have to take them now because we didn't
want to come back any colder and wetter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it just what it just
never reached maturity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the earlier ones, all these others,
the Hawaiians who came out wonderful and
[SPEAKER_04]: we were able to hang them there in the
shade, dry them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't remember, actually,
we didn't have breakdown boxes like we did
[SPEAKER_04]: in following years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just, I think, put them in our in big
bags, you know, garbage bags and carry
[SPEAKER_04]: them up top of the rim with our pack
frames.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had metal pack frames, Kelty's,
and we would just strap everything to them
[SPEAKER_04]: so they didn't get handled as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another thing that when we had
breakdown boxes after they were after the
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk number one was manicured,
it was put right into these wonderful
[SPEAKER_04]: cardboard boxes that we bought stacks of
and brought them down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we assemble them down in the
canyon, taped them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could carry six or seven stacked
on a pack frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more than that, they would be catching
on branches and it wasn't feasible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that came out very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't get crushed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't get smashed pound at a time,
roughly in each box.
[SPEAKER_01]: That 1979 harvest, was that the one that
ended up in the high times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it was referred to in that
high times that is up here on the page?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see here it says,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian stock, killer purple,
2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny because one guy actually paid
us 2000 a pound for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just seeded and they loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had some lightly seeded
Hawaiian, one branch out of all this
[SPEAKER_04]: garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: We came back after, as we traditionally
did every week, we were looking through,
[SPEAKER_04]: inspecting, and then we found one branch
that was seeded.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had hermed back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We took a garbage bag and put it over
quickly, cut that branch off, but it had
[SPEAKER_04]: enough time to lightly seed a few of the
plants neighboring to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people love finding those few seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, do you have any more
of this?
[SPEAKER_04]: They liked the smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the Oaxacan Hawaiian kind of
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how many of these in this list are
from you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: On this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, on this particular list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the one that says, Hawaiian magic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all these others were current things
on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like downtown Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we didn't actually chat
about last time, but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you guys were doing your gorilla,
obviously you can get a wildly divergent
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of males and females off a batch of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you plant everything in your alluvial
plains and all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just cut males as they appeared?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you plant them in pot you did?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And did you go out there more than once a
week when things were turning from veg to
[SPEAKER_03]: flower so that you didn't show up and all
of a sudden a stray male had like nuked a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole patch with seed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how did you handle the transition when
you were worried about maybe we haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: caught all the males yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the next garden that was 19 marked
as 1979 as the double E.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we called it the double E is it
was on a topo map right under the word
[SPEAKER_04]: creek where the double E's were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we went, oh, that's an easy way to
spot it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we called it the double E.
[SPEAKER_04]: We spent three nights, I mean,
three days and two nights every week on
[SPEAKER_04]: the next three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't just go out overnight and water
and then leave the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three days out of seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we anything that was even remotely
spooky looking like, wow, this might be a
[SPEAKER_04]: male change in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We then I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might have just prematurely cut them
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everything was grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the year we ran two gardens are big,
big here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good thing I bought three thousand seeds
because the plants were about a foot tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we came back a week, three days later,
four days later, and grasshoppers had
[SPEAKER_04]: eaten them down every single one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to replant on the first of June.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put them in a tiny seed garden area
where we could put a screening over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were super crowded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were just digging them out with wet
inner palm in our hands and plugging them
[SPEAKER_04]: in, plugging them in and replacing
everything that had been eaten by.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was weird, there was a few plants
that made it through from the grasshopper
[SPEAKER_04]: plague and the ones that we planted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like a month, a month
earlier than the ones we had to replant in
[SPEAKER_04]: June, maybe more than a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the June ones caught up with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing because of the 100 degree
weather and the sun and the watering.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time end of the summer,
like let's say August was around,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were all equal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But having that little six foot by 10 foot
garden full of seeds, luckily we we were
[SPEAKER_04]: able to replant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, it would have been
catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe maybe another angle is where
did you first learn about what an early
[SPEAKER_03]: female or an early male even looked like
back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Rob Clark's book?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it high times?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it people telling you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because obviously like now,
you know, like you look at it and like two
[SPEAKER_03]: pistols mean a female and a little claw
looking thing means a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back then, did you have that kind of
knowledge beforehand?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they get kind of advanced before you
realized what they were?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know from the first year in 1976 that we
grew I got to see what males look like and
[SPEAKER_04]: females, but not till they were probably
more advanced and visible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Rob Clark, I mean, his early book,
the one that he did in 77 on Podpress that
[SPEAKER_04]: was actually his dissertation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, that he he hand drew all the
drawings in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cover every single plant he handed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And drew those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's not only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's a he's a good artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus his photography later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, he says when he traveled around and
did that book on hashish, the photos are
[SPEAKER_04]: just excellent, you know, watering and the
Growers Guide by Mel Frank that I think
[SPEAKER_04]: showed I don't know if they were photos,
but it was a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: But by this year, I had already grown for
two years before this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not the original garden, but by 1980.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we went for two gardens at once,
we had enough experience to know what to
[SPEAKER_04]: look for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, we were spending three days a week
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think maybe even at the time when
the males had to be separated,
[SPEAKER_04]: we might have just had one of our we had a
third partner who helped us part time and
[SPEAKER_04]: he was from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw him when I went to spandibus in 2019
and stayed at his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's he's five years older than I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's he still smokes hash mixed with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been doing it for 50 years as the
custom over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's an artist, of course,
Swiss artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he may have just been down there and
as because I mean, I know what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up it was almost 50, 50 with the
skunk 50, 50 males, 50, 50 females.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was we didn't end up with big,
huge empty sections of the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also transplanted into any open
sections if we had to.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would dig up a plant that was four feet
tall with a big group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And slide it over five more feet to get
into a hole that had more sun and was
[SPEAKER_04]: empty because a male had been removed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did a lot of transplanting and
movements.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was experimental to see if it would
work in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very hardy plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're resilient.
[SPEAKER_04]: The term weed is is accurate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, Jackie, we last week,
we talked about the turps and flavors of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you were just talking about
that first year where the Colombians
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't finish, but you got a few purple
ones out of there that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were made good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I wasn't really satisfied
with my answer last week when when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: asked what what did I describe those those
flavors and smells coming off of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I realized as I thought
back on it that, you know, that most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and what I know about Colombian
is more about what came imported,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and was bought than what I grew
because it just it was just so difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to pull those things off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, for me, it's it's such a
treat that we have, you know, we have it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the the essence of it captured in the
ohays as Sam shared it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that because otherwise it's so hard
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, growers all over the country
were like they tried and it didn't turn
[SPEAKER_00]: out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they found something better in
the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but, you know, can you talk about that
that Colombian, the smells?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, did the anthocyanin or whatever
the purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that really take over and dominate the
one that you managed to to harvest and or,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they were they.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because it was like, you know,
it was Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you know, you know, when that light
starts dropping down, the purple tends to
[SPEAKER_04]: happen more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it it didn't really have a
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hawaiians that were walking crosses,
they had a wonderful said growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Colombian, because they didn't
even have the tiny buds till like late
[SPEAKER_04]: October, beginning of November,
they they didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't warm like the hot summer end of
the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have really much sense at all
until they were dried and then you crushed
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you're talking about,
the piney.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you would, you know,
focused on the piney last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, I had a lot of that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I said, all my school,
all my friends at school, everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing these Colombian plants and the
Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had these little Christmas trees
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people, they got more mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you got you got a really
nice buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pine was was dominant for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the diversity of what we
got in the imported smoke was just above
[SPEAKER_00]: and beyond, you know, because the golds
and the reds and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some amazing stuff, you know,
and and distinctive, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just such a unique, distinctive thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like Mexico, all of them,
you know, whether it's Sinaloa or Guerrero
[SPEAKER_04]: or Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Entirely the way they looked, they smelled
and the highs, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Mexico's a long country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombia is pretty big, but there's in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like tropical versus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five thousand foot level versus Santa
Marta, way up at eight thousand,
[SPEAKER_04]: nine thousand feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it they were land races that didn't
really get mixed up too much back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: old days, at least until the 60s,
maybe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the impact of the processing and
transport to, you know, whatever it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia before it went on the boat or in
the in the case of the high grade stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like the golds and the reds, you know,
maybe on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that that had such an impact on
it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot about the commercial
stuff that that, you know, we used to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: on the street or sell even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what what I think is
interesting is that the essence of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that it was a shadow of what it
was when they when they finished it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the essence of it point.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that we could throw in there is
that a number of people that have talked
[SPEAKER_03]: to Matt and I about growing in that era,
when they first grew green marijuana,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got scared because they didn't think
people would want it because all the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: they got was black, brown or yellow or
gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I that's why I asked last week
if they if they sun dried because that
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to be the way that the Mexicans and
stuff are getting their golds like
[SPEAKER_01]: girdling or sun drying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've heard that consistently that a
lot of times the first home grows are the
[SPEAKER_03]: first outdoors that people did in
different regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, my God, it's such a
weird color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are people going to like it?
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, obviously, like now it's
shifted.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm curious is when you did your when
you did your your shade drying and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, what kind of colors were you
getting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it staying green?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it turning golds and yellows and
browns?
[SPEAKER_04]: No gold, yellows or browns, just greens or
dark greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: The skunk number one was super dark green.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even in 76, when we my dealer friend
and I grew that first year, the the proof
[SPEAKER_04]: was in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would give people a smoke, just one
puff or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were overwhelmed if they were
used to commercial stuff and seedless.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had not seen seedless really,
unless they had gotten tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tie sticks were pretty much always
seedless.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the tie sticks back then were not
green.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were brown or, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the light green.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even give that a thought because
once our few people that bought from us
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked it, that that's all they cared.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they bought everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two people bought everything we grew,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because we heard we heard people
telling us stories about how when they
[SPEAKER_03]: first grew green weed, they tried to brown
it up because they were like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, no one's going to want this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the right color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't look like anything we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and not only that, but some of the
early years, you know, when people have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad experience with green weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the guy who grows a patch
full of Colombian and it doesn't finish
[SPEAKER_00]: and he harvests this leafy stuff with just
a few white hairs and mostly tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he handles it poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's loaded with chlorophyll and he tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sells it to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, all of a sudden there's
this bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green weed is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year, people grow
different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit gets mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They handle it better, you know,
and all of a sudden there's there's high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality green weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people's perception of the color is
that it's a turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to try and overcome that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting them to, you know, try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, this is different or whatever or
or the thing about renaming or changing
[SPEAKER_00]: the appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people would,
you know, we knew that the stuff molded,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that the Colombian that turned
it brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some sort of mold from being
pressed when it was still wet or carried
[SPEAKER_00]: in the in the cargo bay of the ship or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since we'd been smoking that stuff
for years and, you know, people thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might try and, you know,
they might try and press some other wet
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown and get a different appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it never turned out like the
Colombian, you know, and it only wound up
[SPEAKER_00]: making it worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that chlorophyll was pretty horrible
to smoke if you had those unfinished tops
[SPEAKER_00]: that somebody was trying to pass off as
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and plus high times was,
you know, was was becoming really popular
[SPEAKER_00]: and people were hearing about green from
Hawaii and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing for us was, you know,
I mean, I would I had produced some
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing freaking indica buds, but I would
say it was Hawaiian, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or from California just because,
you know, your homegrown isn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because I was charging 200 an
ounce for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and people were happy to pay it,
even though, you know, as kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a guy I had a guy trade me a P.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: system with, you know, with a beautiful
Mike and a Fender backstage 20 for for a
[SPEAKER_00]: half ounce of tie purple tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loved it so much, he came back for
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, I was out of that and
all I had was the green Fino, which didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: finish at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, OK, well, you know,
I knew it wasn't the same stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sold him that second bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and he was so pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wound up giving his money back because
it wasn't even close to the same thing as
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with with the skunk one, did you notice
any like solely broadleaf expressions,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that looked just pure Afghani in the
skunk one top?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of the photos that you posted
last week, I think what was interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: about the skunk was it grew like long
colas and they were almost self pruning in
[SPEAKER_04]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sun leaves would all turn yellow and
you could just shake the plant and they
[SPEAKER_04]: would fall off and leave these long green
colas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have one photo from that I took that
is just slightly blurry, but it's just a
[SPEAKER_04]: series of the four four to six foot tall
colas, you know, like one cola coming out
[SPEAKER_04]: of the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the ones that were six point
eight ounces, you know, on average.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was dense and nice, very deep,
deep green.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was no Indica fat leaf
expressions solely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was uniform.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was truly true breeding at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: What Robert and Sam had accomplished,
I think Robert was more of the geneticist
[SPEAKER_04]: in doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some some place in the history
where they said they had ten thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: things going in red cups and they chose
from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if that's accurate,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really, when we planted it,
it grew the way it looked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each plant, they had a little bit wider
leaves, certainly than like Acapulco gold
[SPEAKER_04]: or Santa Marta or tropical finn leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nothing like the deep chunk or maple
leaf Indica's that, you know, people add
[SPEAKER_04]: on IC mag that look just like,
you know, umbrellas almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could yeah, your head if it's raining
dinosaur leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it your impression then?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, you said before that
you reached out to you reached out to to
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob through a letter and contacted him and
he brought you the seeds is what you said
[SPEAKER_03]: previously.
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you meet Sam back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he talk about their partnership?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he did they did he tell you any of the
work that he had done to get to skunk one
[SPEAKER_03]: that he shared?
[SPEAKER_04]: All my info came from Robert.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never met Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never talked to him personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've I've private message with him on IC
mag in 2012, but nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've I've sent him some labels for his
collection, but I don't I've never met
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all secondhand from Robert when he
described.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if Rob was when I got on
when I got on there, Sam was very big.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I saw all of his collection
of of, you know, essentially breeder art
[SPEAKER_03]: and grower art that they would that they
would make and attach to their pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would post a lot in something called I
was was it called the Breeders Lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was pretty active in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was just I'm just always curious
as to about like what you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: did Rob tell you how long he'd been
working on skunk one when he gave it to
[SPEAKER_03]: you or any kind of like any info along
those lines?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that, you know, he worked in Ben
Loman, which is a little town up in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Redwoods just above Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_04]: You you might go through Ben Loman,
for instance, if you're going to go up
[SPEAKER_04]: further up to like La Honda, where Neil
Young lived still a distance from San
[SPEAKER_04]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he told me that that's where he they
had their little underground greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: going in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but he made it sound like they had
been doing it for a year or two before.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never went into the history of these
other neighbors in Santa Cruz that Sam
[SPEAKER_04]: knew that were the two brothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, all those stories, those I read
more about later in on ICMAG and people
[SPEAKER_04]: disputing it and one person saying,
oh, no, it was this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, he he he mentioned, though,
that he had been working on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought his nineteen seventy seven
treatise, not from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where I found it,
but somewhere online.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when he came out with marijuana
botany, you know, everyone bought it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it wasn't for the growers guide,
Mel Franks, we would have failed because
[SPEAKER_04]: when we had that year, the second year
where we got this twist on the end of all
[SPEAKER_04]: of our plants and they were already six
foot, seven foot plants, we were like
[SPEAKER_04]: freaking out because they were supposed to
be getting flowers instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had the leaves twisting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we he talked about micronutrients and
how you could have a you could be short
[SPEAKER_04]: and a couple micronutrients in your soil
and that could make the world a different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got some concentrated
[SPEAKER_04]: seaweed extract, which have 90 different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Minerals from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing even comes close.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we bought a big backpack pump sprayer
filled with water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it held two gallons and just
walked around and sprayed the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we did it once and waited
three or four days and then we did it
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but by the end of a week or eight or
nine days, they were all untwisting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever they were missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was because of Mel Franks book
about talking about micronutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of zoned it down to being
malignant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lack of malignant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's what's amazing about that
to me is that many years later in 1993,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was planning on growing for the
first time, two of the three books that
[SPEAKER_03]: taught me things was Rob Clark's Marijuana
Botany and Mel Frank's Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there were different additions
by then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, they'd been through some
revisions and things as time had gone on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the same knowledge to a young kid
desperate for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing that even came close
when it first came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there were Bibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really was really was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine got so dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some like rings through it to hold
it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I passed it on to, you know,
another another guy that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wound up growing and breeding and taking
seeds to dead concerts and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was pretty pretty foreign to me as a
skateboard punk rocker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was I think I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was three people involved in that
book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal are the two I
remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a third author that was that
contributed to it to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have the books at my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Aang Lee?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's another photographer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That book.
[SPEAKER_03]: That book I probably read a hundred times
in the six or eight months before I set up
[SPEAKER_03]: my first indoor because I had no idea what
I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, when you got it not so it was
probably called the indoor outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the original one was just Growers
Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I indexed my books so that I could go in
there and find whatever page I needed to
[SPEAKER_04]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the Marijuana Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: More stuff, you know, five hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's probably hard for young
people today to like conceive of just how
[SPEAKER_03]: sparse and hard to come by some of this
information was because they're used to
[SPEAKER_03]: the Internet and typing things in and
forums and resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was really limited back then in
terms of what you could access and how to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those books played, obviously,
even with you guys, they played a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: role in in teaching people exactly how to
pull off a successful crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first first year came out in
1978.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the first edition and or press in
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mine is kind of falling apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look, what's one of my bookmarkers in
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have at least two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said we used to go to the library
and I mean, I would search for everything
[SPEAKER_00]: on hydroponics because I even growing
outdoors, I was doing outdoor hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1981, you know, five gallon buckets
filled with peat moss, cow shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite and vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, fed with eco grow,
you know, granular two part mix.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I went to the library and I
started researching hydroponics and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically I stole any good book from the
library that hydroponics and kept it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that was very much self-study.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the book we are referring to the
Rob Clark thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called The Botany and Ecology of
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my copy that I scanned in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it loaded on the screen?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're numbered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's actually not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the few that's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark actually the one of the few times
that he's ever responded about anything
[SPEAKER_01]: was to give me the print run on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently there were, I think,
fifteen hundred total where it was a first
[SPEAKER_01]: print of five hundred and a second print
of a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't tell the difference between
the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are numbered, some are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But another example, this is he drew this
by hand and all through the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: This book are his drawings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just imagine him getting sitting
wasted and just sitting and just digging
[SPEAKER_04]: drawing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not draw that by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're they're beautiful drawings in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and that's one of the things like
I've been sitting on it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not really out there
for people to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some of the most beautiful
drawings of cannabis in the cannabis part,
[SPEAKER_01]: the parts of the cannabis plant that I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did such an amazing job back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it kind of it kind of, you know,
it kind of reminds me of early,
[SPEAKER_00]: early botanists and explorers,
geneticists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They travel around, you know, different
islands and stuff and discovering dodo
[SPEAKER_00]: birds and things like that and sitting
around drawing in their sketchbooks,
[SPEAKER_00]: describing the fauna and flora of these
these exotic locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got it so accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just they looked exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the indica plants that he he drew in
marijuana botany were just spot on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the elegant the elegance of the
branches and the leaves that he drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I always I didn't know if he drew
him or somebody else did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he drew him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought they were gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another book he did called Hans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was released in Germany that has some
beautiful illustrations of his and but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not available in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you guys can trace down a copy of
Hans, which is German for him,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more beautiful drawings from him
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you zoom over to the Humboldt up here
on your list, the article that I found on
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt growing, I thought not the dog
would find the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has it has Rob Clark in the corner here
when he's 29 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holding a bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's in color.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I only scan in black and white because
I might I'm running low on the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I could have scanned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: This works.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this article is from about 1982.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he mentioned something,
the price of marijuana in 82.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, right up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 82, an estimated one point eight
billion dollars a street value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was 29 in 82.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can go backwards and figure that
out how old he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I met Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came down to Negril once with his wife
at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was we hung out together for a few
days in the grill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the concept was he was going to look
for some land races there, Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see him after those first few
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think he traveled around a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is great because it talks about
the helicopters and in Humboldt and at
[SPEAKER_04]: this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad you saved this second photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figure where it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, one of the one of the
interesting things about when helicopters
[SPEAKER_03]: first started flying is that people were
growing all these giant sativas in the
[SPEAKER_03]: hills and Humboldt and Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody as long as you were tucked
away, nobody cared how big they were
[SPEAKER_03]: because no one was looking for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's articles I've read were
like the very first gardens that got
[SPEAKER_03]: busted by helicopters.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually chopped down most of the
gardens with chainsaws because the the
[SPEAKER_03]: stocks were like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were so big and thick and the people
weren't worried about about getting
[SPEAKER_03]: caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just had these ginormous,
you know, these huge sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, goodness, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gangster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's that's that's pushing a certain
narrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That old chainsaw thing was that's that
was common down in where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was living to, you know, the National
Guard helicopters were flying,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking, looking for the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when we would go out,
when I went out to my gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always dressed in camouflage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the whole gorilla mindset,
leaving no trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would create a trail to your spot
where you would go from step to step,
[SPEAKER_00]: always putting your foot in exactly the
same spot that you did the time before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, crawling under bushes and stuff
to it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're probably familiar,
Raho.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have we have a bunch of manzanitas in
Mendocino County, which are for people
[SPEAKER_03]: that aren't familiar, they're kind of
these like smooth limbed bushes that get
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere from six to 12 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can kind of thin them out
underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people grew in manzanita
patches because you could still get some
[SPEAKER_03]: filtered light, but it wasn't going to be
totally exposed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So crawling around in manzanita patches
and cutting off lower branches to make
[SPEAKER_03]: spots for gardens is is like my first
outdoor experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you holding up there right there,
sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you zoom in on this?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is these are humble photos from that
same article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me try to zoom in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's holding up something on his
thing, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see over here on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy to get back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are some guys pruning their father
and son pruning some big leaf plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they both have 38 caliber weapons in
their back pocket that they point out in
[SPEAKER_04]: this article and the guard dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then here's an aerial shot of a huge
garden like the chainsaw you're
[SPEAKER_04]: describing.
[SPEAKER_04]: People took that risk, but it didn't
always work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once the helicopters came, the helicopters
dramatically changed people's approaches
[SPEAKER_03]: to a huge degree because most of these
things were grown in like like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean, that's super easily
visible from the air, but like not not
[SPEAKER_03]: from driving around.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color difference is just so obvious
from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the tactics for hiding this
stuff became, you know, pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are your humble sheriffs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the garden that they just dismantled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that Newsweek magazine,
Mad Jag, the that came out that at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, there was another article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if it was time or it was
a national publication where they came out
[SPEAKER_00]: with an article talking about this new
high potency kind of super weed that was
[SPEAKER_00]: that was you know, flooding the streets
called skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been I've been looking for this
magazine or this article ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly, I thought the reference
was in that Newsweek that had the guy with
[SPEAKER_00]: the mask and the and the M16.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it wasn't, you know, I've read
that article since and I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a reference to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they describe the effects of skunk in
that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's classic reefer madness,
you know, writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but they honestly they got it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they describe the appearance of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They describe the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty spot on for what I
thought skunk was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tears.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: A reason for tears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from the state of Utah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a it's an entire reefer madness
basically about you know, what's really
[SPEAKER_04]: bizarre is this high school undercover.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an article about guys who look at
he's got a heavy metal t shirt,
[SPEAKER_04]: but he's shown his badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a whole article about going
undercover in the various high schools in
[SPEAKER_04]: Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 21 Jump Street, like the TV show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll tell you, this is obviously
so much later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first time that I ever saw a guy
with waist long dreadlocks tackle someone
[SPEAKER_03]: and then put cuffs on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on Dead Tour, I was like, oh,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are these labeled in this
picture?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do look labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read what they are, but they do
look labeled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they're labeled like Hawaiian Maui
stickless tie, orange Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: They spell Colombian wrong, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: They always spell it wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had some really good photos here
of different things that they had
[SPEAKER_04]: confiscated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oaxacan red, Colombian red, Guerrero gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always love those pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reference pictures from point of
origin and time are so valuable,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, so, so valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard when it's cops, you know,
taking the pictures and you got to hope
[SPEAKER_01]: that they got your bag right and got the
strain name with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if it's your bag, you probably got
other things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, freaking provenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one thing that one thing that I
think is kind of interesting, too,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's it's it's obviously we don't need
to dwell on it too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that, like, from what I'm
listening to and you guys are talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about all these different highland and
lowland Colombians and all these different
[SPEAKER_03]: regions and stuff like that and all these
different Mexicans and what they were,
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think that like the cocaine
trade and profitability with that sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: blocked off the next generation of
Americans from being able to experience
[SPEAKER_03]: that because the groups that were all
bringing in those Colombians and bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: in those Mexicans, they shifted to a more
profitable thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it also became unsafe for people
a lot of times that looked like us to go
[SPEAKER_03]: down to those regions and get those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was this era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was two things that were happening at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the cocaine, you know, it became much
more profitable for the same people that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, were formerly smuggling
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the American
homegrown market had had happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that product was just such a
higher level of quality than what what the
[SPEAKER_00]: imports had because of the freshness and,
you know, the introduction of hard hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: hard hitting Indica's in their high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what what what year do you think
that was?
[SPEAKER_03]: 80, 82, 83.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, we don't need to sidetrack
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's been an interplay between like
what Mexico and down south does versus
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on in America and like each
one responding to the other in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis that's been going on for,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not that's not a sidetrack at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, it's another Madjag
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we dive on into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that the story about, you know,
how, you know, Madjags contribution to the
[SPEAKER_00]: to the the the Mexican cannabis gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: My people's you represent my people in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did they how did this start
happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: What era did the the Mexico stuff start
occurring at Jagan Howe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the last year I grew in Madjag
Canyon was 81.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by 82, I I knew a guy who was a pilot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not the pilot I wrote about,
like that, you know, when we talked about
[SPEAKER_04]: 60 tons of packy hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a guy I met him when I was working
a regular job at a truck loading place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked for Georgia Pacific for two years
in Phoenix in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy, one day he walked up to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was loading his truck up with empty
plastic bottles, which is what they
[SPEAKER_04]: produce at Georgia Pacific.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, hey, if if I found a whole
bunch of weed out in the desert,
[SPEAKER_04]: could you sell it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had short hair, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he just figured he felt that vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, well, I was flying over this area
and I see where someone jettisoned one an
[SPEAKER_04]: empty fuel canister and it stuck in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to go out there and check
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's they were smuggling weed
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, man, just let me know.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came back a week later and he was all
disappointed because it was just an empty
[SPEAKER_04]: fuel canister.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually Air Force that had
dropped it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was stuck in the ground,
looked like a bomb, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it didn't explode.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then he started talking about other
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden, like two months
later, he comes back and I'm loading his
[SPEAKER_04]: truck and he says, I met the people in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and I said, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's he stole a twin engine Cessna
from Scottsdale Airport, flew to
[SPEAKER_04]: Guadalajara and gave it to the cartel.
[SPEAKER_04]: To prove to them that he was not a narc.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a gangster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know later he stole a helicopter out
of Apache Junction and threw it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he only got 20 miles into Mexico
before something went wrong mechanically
[SPEAKER_04]: and he had to crash land and hike his way
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the FBI came to his house because he
found his fingerprints in Mexico on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he denied everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they couldn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scared the shit out of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I bet the good Lord.
[SPEAKER_04]: They brought several loads up of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found an airstrip in along the Mogollon
Rim in a small town area way out by
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like within five minutes,
they said they would be there at one o
[SPEAKER_04]: 'clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like they were at one oh five
kicking out bales onto the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would they would bring five
hundred kilos each flight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where one of two of the flights
had labels already in them from someone
[SPEAKER_04]: who was supposed to get them in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: But something went wrong and we got them
instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still I'm still hunting for those
labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got them somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a connection with those guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was eighty two and eighty three.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Bufalo that Rafael Carro
Quintero.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could see it from space.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a square couple of miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they show it in that TV show
Narco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's the name of the garden or
the farm El Bufalo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rancho Bufalo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was this at the beginning of the the
Gallardo era of the development?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is when they were just doing
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happened was they they grew
thousands and thousands of hectares of of
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't have anyone growing seeds,
seed crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they they were desperate for seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my pilot friend, along with my
other friend, who was the weed dealer in
[SPEAKER_04]: Tempe, we filled two quart sized bags half
full.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he stuck one in each of his cowboy
boots and gave it to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were so grateful because it they
they had no seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately, I was part of this
because seeds from five different zones in
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexico ended up in their hands and became
the new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, well, it's like, why would you
say, unfortunately, in 1980s, Dutch
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics were already in the grill of
Jamaica and the people go wild over them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were growing them up in Orange Hill
and all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So land races were getting squeezed out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to find true Jamaican, I don't think
it's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's probably land race that's
still in stash spots and certainly in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: But boy, Jamaica being a little island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you could clarify for a second,
then those seeds that you brought down or
[SPEAKER_03]: he brought down smuggled in his boots.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were they a mix of?
[SPEAKER_04]: They were a mix of Guerrero, Sinaloa,
Michoacan, Oaxacan that my dealer friend
[SPEAKER_04]: in Tempe and high graded over the course
of like two or three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best of the loads that had passed
through the loads.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why you were like,
oh, you were a little bummed about it
[SPEAKER_03]: because you kind of mixed the strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they started growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then instead of it being like a
regional thing where these specific kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: were coming from, it was sort of a blend
coming back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: El Buffalo got discovered.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote down this November 14th of 84 is
when they found it and burned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually the smoke affected people
within a hundred mile radius.
[SPEAKER_04]: They burned 500 hectares and they estimate
that it was worth two point five billion
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars at that time in 84.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a famous scene in Narcos where
he I think it was it was Guerrero's
[SPEAKER_01]: brother, Raf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that his brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces in the in the in the series
like this is the super the super strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that the scene Samia right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this before or after you met him that
or is this the the hybrid that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we gave them seeds in 82 and 83 and
El Buffalo was captured and burned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it ran for years before
that, but just in general, they King
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrell was growing weed in other places.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Buffalo was like their huge place.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had their own wells drilled there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in Sinaloa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've I've read about it in a book
called The Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 900 pages long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's written by a DEA agent who is in
charge of all the stuff going on then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has three chapters, one on heroin,
one on cocaine and one on weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one on needs about El Buffalo
being spotted by a TWA pilot or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're flying over and they went,
what in the world?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just mentioned a casual that's
where Kiki Camarena got a job and went and
[SPEAKER_04]: actually penetrated it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the second movie of Sicario,
so popular, it's kind of similar because
[SPEAKER_04]: he's dressed up as a compass, you know,
and he gets a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kiki is the is that the that's the name of
the agent that got killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Camarena.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that caused a huge amount of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Left it alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but they didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when they were switching over
to cocaine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just about 84, 85.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that being burned, Kintaro,
from what I read, just became an addict
[SPEAKER_04]: of, you know, drug addict of whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was he was sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't want to see them go into
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Rafael Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo,
he went ahead and went, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he became he formed the first cartel with
all these loose plazas that were existing
[SPEAKER_04]: guys over here and guys over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I stayed at his hotel in 84,
one of his many.
[SPEAKER_04]: He owned apparently a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend who is the pilot,
we went down there and my friend from
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombia found his way there from
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all had a big party.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were hoping that my friend from
Colombia would be able to turn them on to
[SPEAKER_04]: newer connections and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know really what happened because
he loved to do coke.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he and I both decided we didn't want
to be in that business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the pilot, this guy, he he kept going.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were using our airstrip, the one that
we had found for weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sixteen hundred to two thousand pounds of
coke at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did nine loads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they an off duty sheriff who was
cutting wood saw them landing and
[SPEAKER_04]: unloading and they got busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have no idea what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a clip I've I've posted before,
I think an IC mag.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I never met I never met Miguel Felix,
but my partners did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did enjoy his hospitality because we
went into this hotel room and there was
[SPEAKER_04]: just like in the movies, a plate with a
four ounce pile of coke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cocaine and two other guys who did nothing
but just bring cases of beer all through
[SPEAKER_04]: the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's nice of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a weekend at Natsos place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except except there's a lot more men,
a lot crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt loves that if he doesn't at least
once a show to throw me off my game with
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, he's upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, he found his opening and he
took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she said.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, just you know, Raho said that
that that whole thing is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I when I was when I was starting
to do guerrilla in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things that the Mexicans did
was that even with the cocaine,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told that like still 70 percent of
their profits was marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they really didn't like all this
homegrown in the West Coast sort of taking
[SPEAKER_03]: their taking their, you know, their their
sales really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they started sending these teams
all from down by where Matt is all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: up to the Oregon border and going in the
national forests and just growing a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: amount as much as they could get away with
in all the national forests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way, they didn't have to smuggle
it over the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's that was kind of so
there's been this obviously this like
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what I was saying before about like
how one one country influences the other
[SPEAKER_03]: is the homegrown movement has dramatically
changed how the how the Mexicans approach
[SPEAKER_03]: growing weed, because, you know,
for a long time, they were sort of the
[SPEAKER_03]: primary weed people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in Arizona, with the border
here, Tucson was like the capital of
[SPEAKER_04]: smugglers and and dealers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it moved up to Phoenix and Tempe
and Scottsdale.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they they busted a big grow in the
canyon next door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to us just 10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a gang from from Mexico
operating out of Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had a spring that they had found
up on the side of this mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had a system of drip irrigation
that ran a mile down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just went too big.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys, they just didn't even think
about hunters and ranchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just threw a team at a group,
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they all got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to some degree, bring on a spring
on a hillside model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the way it was done in
NorCal when I was out there that summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think the cartels kind of had a
they viewed a lot of their workers as semi
[SPEAKER_03]: disposable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they sort of expected a certain
amount to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just threw a lot of people out
there in a lot of different regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they figured most of them will be
successful and some of them won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of how they went about it,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they had money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when the when the powder
came in, you know, I think a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian import just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stopped entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Mexican commercial became they
probably filled the gap for that for that
[SPEAKER_00]: tier of product quality around the
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you that, you know,
I mean, I started smoking in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was brown Mexican and green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see Thai.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see Panamanian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see any of those of those famous
things that people wax poetic about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Mexican.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a decade later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I saw was Mexican, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just never.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never saw anything other than just
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we got a little bit into Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just a hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go more into Mexico?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some more details you want to add
in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just rubbing shoulders with these
famous people is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know who they were at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just guys exporting weed from
Guadalajara area.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when we found out it was Miguel
Angel and we were like, whoa, shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We I'm so glad we didn't get sucked into
the cocaine deal because the this guy who
[SPEAKER_04]: who was a truck driver, he could fly
helicopters, he could fly planes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He he went that direction and sold 10
kilos to an undercover agent north of
[SPEAKER_04]: Phoenix in the biggest hand to hand sale
by in Arizona history at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got I think it was seven kilos and
he got 10 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: His brother kept going and did those loads
on our air our air strip that we found.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they got nine of them before they got
busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we calculated at the price of coke at
the time that it was it came to around a
[SPEAKER_04]: quarter billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Million dollars of coke that they
successfully brought in before they got
[SPEAKER_04]: busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have no idea what happened to those
boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rosalda Blanco, I had never heard her name
until I read about it in Newsweek or Time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's who my Colombian friend was
actually working for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his job was to count money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would go to Aspen where they bring
in D.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: nines or something like six tons at a time
of Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would just his fingers,
he could barely move them after a week
[SPEAKER_04]: because they didn't have machines yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then she's I can imagine hand counting
five million dollars, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in 20s and 10s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the stories started
happening about how they weighed their
[SPEAKER_04]: their money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in Florida, he went to an
apartment building once and he said
[SPEAKER_04]: there'd be like five apartments and they'd
have a secret door in a closet that would
[SPEAKER_04]: link it to the next apartment and to the
next apartment so that if they had to
[SPEAKER_04]: bail, they could just disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he went into one apartment and he said
it was Florida ceiling with tiny
[SPEAKER_04]: passageways in the hallways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of just money piled floor to ceiling,
every single room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said there was millions of millions
of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one of the kind of places
where they would just weigh money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then send it back to
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the responsibility of being the dude
who has to count it, because like you get
[SPEAKER_01]: that shit wrong, you're going to be the
first person they look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Jamaican friends in Brooklyn,
the guy who was in charge, he goes by the
[SPEAKER_04]: nickname Sata.
[SPEAKER_04]: He overpaid us once.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did it as a trick to see if we were
going to tell him and be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We counted the money a second time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said in his house in Brownsville.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, you know, Sada, you're overt
by two thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, not even possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was just messing with us because he
was we were it was early in our
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship and wanted to see if we were
honest enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We passed the test.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do that with my spray,
like my reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd give it to different people and,
you know, give them different like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you know, for this exchange or this
exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing mostly that I was never going
to get anything, but just kind of get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good gauge of who is going to just take
it, run with it, use it to make themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of money or who would do,
you know, what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a small loss, but it's a good
way to judge a potential future lifelong
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheap way to to figure out who you can
trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to them and to the other person,
it's almost like from a greedy person's
[SPEAKER_01]: angle, it's like, well, this one bottle
could potentially make me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: several thousand dollars worth of
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it worth the bird?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and a lot of times it is worth
the bird to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magic magic always says if there is a
doubt about a person, then there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good quote.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a line from the movie Ronin and
Ronin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, if there's a doubt,
there is no doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's near the end of the movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when you find out that he never
quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was still working for the CIA or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert De Niro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Classical movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you I treat my life that way,
if I have a doubt about something,
[SPEAKER_04]: I just go, I'll wait and see what the
universe does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I didn't do that when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You seem to have both feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you seem to have a very magical
touched life, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people you know,
only live a fraction or see a fraction of
[SPEAKER_01]: what what you managed to get yourself
wound up in time and time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the fact is, you guys weren't
outlaws as far as carrying guns and being
[SPEAKER_01]: cowboys and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You carried this very humble with your
attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a great big throwing knife on my hip
when I was going to the canyon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't know what good that
would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we we specifically didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the guys from Jerome, they are all
heavily armed and they would have barbed
[SPEAKER_04]: wire in the bushes and weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You read about this in magazines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just going, that's that makes
them instantly dangerous criminals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were just hippies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was criminals.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an important distinction to make,
because I think we've chatted for long
[SPEAKER_03]: enough now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can safely say that everybody on on
this this little this little call that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're doing is is a weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, having been in a bunch of
counterculture kind of my whole life,
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally differentiate between like
people who do certain substances but are
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise like honorable and very good
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just some of the things they decided
to get into happened to not be societally
[SPEAKER_03]: acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then people that are like actual
criminals, you know, where it's and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a big difference there because
there's a lot of people that are wonderful
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing that they do wrong,
really, they could get them into
[SPEAKER_03]: significant trouble is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I and I was when I was
listening to you guys talk about some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the the the transition into powders and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I've always thought
about is that like the weed game or the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed scene is inherently just like less
dangerous than that other world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when that other world started
happening, maybe it's because of the way
[SPEAKER_03]: it makes people think or the way people
act or the money was so much bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seemed to bring out a lot of like
negative qualities in people that when you
[SPEAKER_03]: were in the weed game existed,
but maybe weren't like maybe weren't like
[SPEAKER_03]: accented quite so much.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my friends in Brooklyn, they would
Sato would open the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd have a Mach 9 in his hand,
you know, and he'd look around and make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure it was cool to let us in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they had they had plenty of weapons.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my friend Ricky, who he's still my
friend, I see him when I go to New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lives in Brooklyn in the same apartment
since 74.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never, ever had a gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other Rastas did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but he was he's a philosopher.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a real gentle guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good brother of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known him 40 years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he he's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go have curry goat with him whenever
we're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He takes me to a different restaurant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love curry goat and ackee and salt fish
they have in these those Caribbean
[SPEAKER_04]: neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can still get all that the
restaurants they cater to the people who
[SPEAKER_04]: live there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, too, like for Mendocino
County, there's definitely people that
[SPEAKER_03]: have guns that had the intention on using
them, you know, if they were accosted by
[SPEAKER_03]: other humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a lot of growers that had
guns on them simply because they were in
[SPEAKER_03]: some remote spot on the hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they came across a bear with cubs
or a mountain lion, they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: just die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to have a fighting chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was there was this idea of I'm
alone in the deep woods by myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not my territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's bear and mountain lion and
other things that that I'm a lot weaker
[SPEAKER_03]: than even Jaguars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaguars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, mountain lions, you know,
bears usually here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mountain lions, they've been watching you
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever even know that they're there,
you know, but we would encounter all that
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of times all of a sudden
something would go wrong with our water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd have to walk the water line back
to like the the cat, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the the spring box that we had made or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're walking through deep woods
totally alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and you're in the deep woods
and, you know, you don't have teeth or
[SPEAKER_03]: claws and you're not super strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people would have pistols or
shotguns or something just to make
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves feel OK when they're out there
and sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dual Dobermans is is popular with some
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew they had two Dobermans and they
were, you know, they went wherever they
[SPEAKER_04]: went.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had their Dobermans and.
[SPEAKER_04]: One's name was Tor and the other one was
Tia Tortilla.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this one guy and, you know,
they they were not quite command dogs,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they were close.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would tell them to do something and
they would just do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and they'd sniff out a bear or a bear
would, you know, better let your dogs
[SPEAKER_04]: fight the bear than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in my era, too, it became
uncomfortable because the penalty for
[SPEAKER_03]: getting caught with a gun at a row was
actually like quite a bit worse than the
[SPEAKER_03]: grow itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was kind of like a do you risk it
even because even if even if you were
[SPEAKER_03]: going to beat the case on a medical thing
or something like that later on with the
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, they'd be like, oh, no, he's a
hardened criminal armed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was ready to hurt people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we taught him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, that's what this is from
that Humboldt article.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're pointing out this machine gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says Humboldt deputies sees this
menacing array of weaponry, including an
[SPEAKER_04]: Uzi and an AK-47, along with marijuana in
raids on growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they love to point those out and
make everybody think that that's what most
[SPEAKER_04]: growers are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people, sadly, I mean,
wherever there's profit involved,
[SPEAKER_03]: people get into it for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and some of the people involved
certainly were that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't classify it as the majority,
but certainly a percentage.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, humans are humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't feel real comfortable in
Guadalajara, to tell you the truth,
[SPEAKER_04]: because everyone was packing in those.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guys carrying the beer were packing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their job.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took us out to soup.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the best sushi in Guadalajara and
it was some of the best sushi I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: had in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they they were it was a lieutenant of
Miguel's.
[SPEAKER_04]: He went by the name of Wapo, which means
handsome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they took us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was amazing because the guy who ran
it, he'd speak in Japanese to his crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he turned to us and speak in English
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he turned and talked to these
guys in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was quite, quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't doesn't fit in with the stereotype
of the dumb of the dumb stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I mean, I think Americans are we're
very we're very isolated because we've got
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadians who also speak English for the
most part, besides the people in Quebec
[SPEAKER_03]: above us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got two oceans next to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of parts of the world
are multilingual just because they
[SPEAKER_03]: encounter so many different languages as
part of their daily life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in America, we are we're kind of
broken from that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my Swiss friend speaks five
languages perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have an aunt who's Swiss and she
speaks four.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and so much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I I actually kind of regret that
because I think the longer the younger you
[SPEAKER_03]: learn language, the more fluent and fluid
you are in in speaking and reading it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Americans, a lot of times like
it does something to your brain to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to speak multiple languages and
communicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think it's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the the story of the peyote
prince.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you briefly or maybe not even briefly,
can you tell us what a peyote prince is?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the there are both I don't know how
they came into this, but they both knew
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam and Sam was a road chief in the Native
American church on the Navajo reservation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had a license that allowed him to
go to northern Mexico across the border
[SPEAKER_04]: from Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'd come back with a quarter million
or a half a million of peyote buttons for
[SPEAKER_04]: the church, where actually 90 percent of
it wasn't going to the church.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was going to these two guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would one lived in Tempe,
two blocks from the police station.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other one lived in Cottonwood,
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I lived at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these were fresh buttons.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had to dry them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the guy in Tempe had date date racks
that they dry dates in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was perfect for peyote.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you went into his little old house in
Tempe, you had to turn sideways to go down
[SPEAKER_04]: the hallways or go into any room.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, that wasn't the stacks of
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just stacks of date trays drying
two hundred thousand buttons.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once they dry, as you've if you've
seen them, they look like little flat
[SPEAKER_04]: disks and almost like jerky, you know,
like a little piece of jerky.
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't be fooled.
[SPEAKER_04]: But until you take and they would just
sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was 19.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seventy three when I was first in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could get them as low as a nickel a
button if you bought a certain amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you could sell them for a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Illinois, in cargo all over the
United States, these two guys had friends
[SPEAKER_04]: who who would come to Arizona and get
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they shipped in UPS or in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: People always took them.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gave a guy two hundred and he was going
through custom or through the gate to go
[SPEAKER_04]: to his air his flight.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was about 1980, I'm thinking,
in Phoenix, or maybe it was 78,
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he looked back to see his friend
leaving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the security guys was holding
the bag of peyote up in the air and
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and that and he asked him,
what are these?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, they're peyote, they're on
cactus seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy went, oh, OK, and gave back to
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: They they didn't even have it wasn't even
in the radar and their training yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The princes were amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know both of them still.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still both alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them isn't as healthy as the
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were, you know, it was just an
amazing thing that millions and millions
[SPEAKER_04]: of buttons they sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them were diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were diverted to Redway to the guy
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of my friends would drive 50 to 70
thousand buttons to up to northern
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would get turned into mescaline
sulfate pure.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mescaline is only like 40 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is some number like that of the
alkaloids in peyote.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one that everyone knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they even call it mescaline.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's many other alkaloids that are
significant in a peyote journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you extract just the mescaline
sulfate, then it's a different journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did them both.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I compared it to the mescaline sulfate
was like peyote without the teacher,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we take peyote or experience it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this inner voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to describe, but it seems like
it's someone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's you, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your inner consciousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're hearing your thoughts in a way that
it sounds like it's an external voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've never done peyote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm terrified of throwing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me interject something here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience with peyote is probably a
lot less than yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say that the buttons were some
of the more bitter things that I ever
[SPEAKER_03]: intentionally swallowed in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can see how the mescaline pills might
might go down a little smoother for some
[SPEAKER_03]: people, because you really have to be
like, OK, this is going to be good for me
[SPEAKER_03]: because they don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as bitter as wormwood,
but it's right up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty intense bitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I remember that was that's my
strongest memory of trying to consume them
[SPEAKER_03]: was like, man, man, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was people doing peyote
elements to avoid it going into their gut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was big in the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly a couple of ladies trying to get me
to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they would make tea and then just do
an animal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you would have this wonderful
trip and you never throw up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get any discomfort because you
get your gut, your stomach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, like I've I've done
ayahuasca in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: He poofs all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good Lord, I do not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say that when you when you are
like, you know, meeting your creator or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever and you're and you're super fired
up, having your stomach hurt and having to
[SPEAKER_03]: purge any which way you have to purge is
pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember when I did it in Brazil,
I had to run out and I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to get rid of some things outside of
myself in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really wanted a bright American,
clean, bathroom, because I felt so
[SPEAKER_03]: exposed, just like running in the dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and that experience of other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: South America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, peyote, it doesn't it
doesn't feel good digesting some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: alkaloids you were discussing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your body is not ready to digest them
comfortably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes chocolate mescaline and the
stuff that was being sold on the hill in
[SPEAKER_04]: Boulder was not mescaline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even at that low price of five or six or
eight cents a button, when this was being
[SPEAKER_04]: made by that that wizard chemist in
northern California, it it enough to get
[SPEAKER_04]: you high would cost you ten dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these one and two dollar hits the
chocolate mescaline were just LSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mixed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you paid her ten, fifteen dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's photos on my on one of my
chronicles.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like pick up sticks about an
inch long, sharp needles.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you poured them out of a bottle,
they would just pile up in these sharp
[SPEAKER_04]: needle looks and they'd have to be crushed
into a powder to put them in a cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just ate some of the crystals once.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but the guy who said, you know,
if you're measuring this out, a good trip
[SPEAKER_04]: would be ten to fifteen dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So very few people have actually even seen
or done mescaline sulfate is the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would even say in my era when I was
experimenting with that stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's almost all relabeled LSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it just was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people haven't experienced it because
the buttons are hard to come by and they
[SPEAKER_03]: taste gross and and people are just
marketing to a different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're like, oh, yeah, here's some
mescaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was some really good advice you
gave in one of your stories, Jack,
[SPEAKER_01]: about juicing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can you talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the last time I did peyote,
I juiced 50 buttons, fresh buttons and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten is you eat 10 fresh buttons.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could get those down, you will have
a really strong journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We took 50 and juice them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a quart bottle of beautiful
emerald green liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend who was the tall fellow,
my first grow partner, he drank a third of
[SPEAKER_04]: the bottle and I drank two thirds of the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he spent the whole night face down on
his sleeping bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never moved for like 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would ask him a question and he
wouldn't answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then about three or four minutes
later, he go, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a time lag.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a fire going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was saying, let's go for a hike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just he was immobilized.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he had a good when he woke up in the
morning, he said, I had the strangest
[SPEAKER_04]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he did enjoy it, though, like the movie
Young Guns with Emilio Estevez and all
[SPEAKER_04]: those young kids stars that were there's a
scene in there where they eat peyote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're the one guy shooting his gun
wildly out at this mining claim.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the what other guys talking and you
hear his voice, but he's not talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whoever produced that movie has done
peyote because they knew about the voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so clear in that scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just amazed that someone had or they
had a technical advisor that knew that
[SPEAKER_04]: that time how they would do it,
because he was stumbling around and he
[SPEAKER_04]: could hear this voice talking to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I managed tried to get me to talk about
psychedelics on the show, and I've kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: kept it weed focused.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say that sometimes when when
things get very intense, you're kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: locked in your own mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if your friend was laying down what
they're experiencing and feeling and
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking and is so intense, you just lose
track of the fact that you have legs and
[SPEAKER_03]: arms and you can't really interact with
the world because you have so much sensory
[SPEAKER_03]: data that's coming into your brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're thinking about so many things
that like all that other stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: extraneous to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's common.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that on mushrooms, on LSD,
on high doses of different things where
[SPEAKER_03]: you just end up kind of in your own head.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a very physical thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very inward thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so sometimes that's good and
sometimes that's bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it usually is is is positive long
term.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as long as you got a safe space
and you're with friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Set and setting is everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think for episode three,
we might adventure maybe if you're open to
[SPEAKER_01]: it, maybe make that more of the full
expanse of psychological psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spiritual journey that it brought Mad
Jag to this point because we're buttoned
[SPEAKER_01]: up against the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, like for those who are
watching this, we recorded this around
[SPEAKER_01]: right around Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's kind of squeezing in hours to
get them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also wanted to really thank you guys
for spending your time with us and every
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone in the audience on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's an honor, man, and a
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so glad that we I was able to
convince Raho to join in the way he has
[SPEAKER_04]: because I met him for the first time last
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been we've been face to face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, face to face.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've been friends for since around
2012 on the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just a gas to meet him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to see him sit with people talking
about strains and varieties, there is only
[SPEAKER_04]: one other person a guy who goes by the
name Satva, who is in Boulder,
[SPEAKER_04]: who can tell you about 30 different types
of Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's been growing Colombian in Boulder
for like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 10 different Punta Roja strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he and he goes to these places.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's he his wife speaks fluent Spanish.
[SPEAKER_04]: He speaks some and they go down to
Guerrero a lot along the coast in little
[SPEAKER_04]: towns that you can only get to by boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's posted some photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's he was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did join us, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can I can say from my perspective that
first, Matt will tell you it takes a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: to shut me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to talk as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I burn with questions almost every
third sentence that you or Raho talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to afterwards write down various
questions and ideas that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really cool that we're having
like this multistage thing, because an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour or two after we do these things,
I get I'm like, oh, my God, why didn't I
[SPEAKER_03]: follow up on that so bad?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to remember, you know, because
there's this offhanded comment and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, conversations go in different
directions and you don't always get to
[SPEAKER_03]: follow up on stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like free flowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a wealth there's a wealth of
of information and just enjoyable convo
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, remember this for next time,
pay phones and quarters, pay phones and
[SPEAKER_04]: quarters and quarters, because that's how
we had to communicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd call my family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my that was my we ever talk about
the psychedelic aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my era.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay phones and quarters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what a chinger is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a black box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did when we were on dead tour
is we someone discovered that when you put
[SPEAKER_03]: quarters into a pay phone, the pay the
company actually knows what coin you're
[SPEAKER_03]: putting in by the tone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a dime is one tone and nickel is one
tone.
[SPEAKER_03]: A quarter is one tone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody got the clever idea that you
could get these little recorders from
[SPEAKER_03]: Radio Shack that recorded about 30 seconds
and you could record them and you could
[SPEAKER_03]: just push in quarters into the thing and
record.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you go to make a long
distance call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you we would.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would use pay phones and all these
different things and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: tell each other where we're going to be at
what time of day and what hour and call
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as a boomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls them chingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call them black boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hold it up to the mouthpiece of the
phone and hit play and it would make the
[SPEAKER_00]: sound of the coins falling into the
machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually, eventually the phone
company caught onto it and you would get
[SPEAKER_03]: an operator going, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would have to bail.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, yeah, it that was that was
before cell phones when pay phones were
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine dollars and 90 cents for three
minutes to Cali, Colombia, from in 1982.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the operators were going what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I yeah, it was I used a lot
of quarters.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my friend in Manhattan, one of the
three brothers of the weed people,
[SPEAKER_04]: he would buy a thousand dollars worth at a
time at a bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had a cart and he'd bring them out
and load up his car.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whenever he go out, he just put like
10 rolls in his pockets because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, never know how many phone calls
you're going to have to make and how long
[SPEAKER_04]: because he was always calling to different
states.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay phones.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a little spy versus spy on that
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were safer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they were safer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you rotated and didn't use
the same ones all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always sucked following not to go after
a pay phone because they're just so
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just cannot deal with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, he's got two in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't get one last time, so he's
bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really practically three with the
whole boofing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad someone remembered that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll know, especially messages at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at almost two hours here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Matt, if you want to plug anything and
we'll keep this thing going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of paths we can go
down and we still only scratch the surface
[SPEAKER_03]: on some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we made it to map one,
1979.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, yeah, next round, we're going
to go to 1980 map and then continue on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our merch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out syndicategear.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, Raho, anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of focused on the Madjag stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can organize or get a little bit
of a game plan to limit or focus
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we won't spin off so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to drill down on the
upcoming ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, maybe with all this discussion
about old Mexicans, I'd maybe give a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to one of my boys, Cryptic Labs,
who has a great reputation for his walk-in
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are stuff that he's collected back
in the 80s and has preserved and shared
[SPEAKER_00]: and is turning out great lines today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just dug out a fresh batch of old
seeds and has done a selection on them and
[SPEAKER_00]: has found a couple of amazing phenos that
I think he'll be coming out with soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cryptic Labs for the old Mex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, just looking forward to
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my own stuff to throw in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your link to the clothing and
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndicategear.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Syndicategear.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to toss in a quick thing to
Zomia Collective out of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some amazing old Land Race ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The squirrel tail, the red string tie,
the Dai Deng.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to mispronounce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, yeah, they ship very fast and I
got my stuff, which is not always easy
[SPEAKER_01]: when sending money out of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So props to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: People looking for Land Race stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legit place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Natto?
[SPEAKER_03]: All I have to say is that I'm excited on
these conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as always, I'm very happy for anyone
that takes the time to listen to us ramble
[SPEAKER_03]: on about a weed and history and culture
and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
