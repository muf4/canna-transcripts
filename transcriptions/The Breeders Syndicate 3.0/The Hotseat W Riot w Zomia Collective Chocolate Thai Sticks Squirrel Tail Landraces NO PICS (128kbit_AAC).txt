[SPEAKER_03]: Leaving comments, telling not so his voice
lulls you into a trance works as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope you take the time to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to put out the best possible shows
for you we can and want to build this
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again from all of us at the
Breeders Syndicate family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_03]: the first person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_03]: not so dog breeder and grower from
Mendocino to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_03]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start writing some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Brendan from Zomia Collective.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today we're going to be talking about
land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's been going on in Thailand,
the current political climate,
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of what Zomia Collective is all
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, like I said, this is Brendan
from Zomia Collective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very special group out in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been speaking with him lately
about what's going on out there and just
[SPEAKER_03]: been totally blown away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fascinated, interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very rare in our community where I
run into someone where I feel like their
[SPEAKER_03]: passion is at the true fervor level that
mine is or a lot of my friends are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it's just like, this is what we live
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like Brendan is one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome, Brendan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to meet you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking about passion,
that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we live for here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from the type of political activities
you've gotten yourself into and the works
[SPEAKER_03]: you do for social change, it's very,
very humbling to watch from a person way
[SPEAKER_03]: over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what I'd love to be doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mad props.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me a little bit about Zomia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what Zomia is in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Zomia is a collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a project that's working on long-term
land-raised conservation in Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fundamentally, it's much more than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a social movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a concept in political philosophy and
anthropology that's sort of grounded in an
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of the indigenous people of
the hilltrop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sort of non-jurisdictional entity,
which comprises about 100 million people
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking so many different languages,
all of whom are united in a refusal to
[SPEAKER_01]: partake in the state, in paying taxes,
in being conscripted, and instead live in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hills away from everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that unites the region
is the choice of crops, namely cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with a foundation in political
activism, which we can get into if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want, a sort of nucleus of cannabis
breeders, growers, village elders in
[SPEAKER_01]: tribal communities formed into a
collective with this purpose of
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation, the land-raised cannabis in
Southeast Asia, perhaps even beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me what kind of pushed you in
this direction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did you grow up?
[SPEAKER_03]: What got you into the Southeast Asia
climate, stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I'm Basque.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the Basque country, but I grew up
in Scotland, and that was kind of where me
[SPEAKER_01]: and Matthew were talking, kind of a little
bit the sort of train spotting style of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were buying cannabis from pretty
sketchy places from a pretty young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, for those who know,
you know what the scene's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you catch that bug, and
especially for us, we were really lucky to
[SPEAKER_01]: get stuff like Gold Stamp Bazaar,
Gold Seal, like Black Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite being in a really northern,
remote location, we did benefit from some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the sort of the small scale smugglers
before the war on terror and the changes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the airports, sort of killed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from then it was, you know,
at 16, I came out to India and then to
[SPEAKER_01]: Southeast Asia and ended up never leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of my formative
experiences were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fell into the wine industry,
strangely enough, as a sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, francophone in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's this kind of,
there's this, I guess, this racism,
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose, where the, or internalized
racism, I don't know how you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: describe it, but there's the need for like
a token French guy to sell wine in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fancy restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter whether he's Basque
or actually French or not, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: close enough, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, as a lover of, you know,
good taste and tiroir and everything else,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always had a bit of chip on my shoulder
about good food sort of being so
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this was my way to,
to be able to taste what I wanted to taste
[SPEAKER_01]: and to talk with chefs and that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great, but I also, it was
great, but it was also terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go very disillusioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the opportunity to sort of
bring the structure of sommelier in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular to the cannabis world came
about, I jumped on it because it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the culmination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, 16 year old me wouldn't have
believed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just a dream country,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically lucky enough to be
working in, in restaurants with a budget
[SPEAKER_01]: high enough to pay for traveling in terms
of R and D and pre COVID, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling, you know, looking for
indigenous or traditional fermented
[SPEAKER_01]: beverages for, for, for food pairings led
us, led me and my team to be in contact
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of communities who are also
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the course of, you know,
spending time in these communities,
[SPEAKER_01]: learning how they ferment different
grains, materials, pulses, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: into alcohol and drinks, the opportunity
came about to, to, to sort of learn more
[SPEAKER_01]: about the land-based cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very nicely timed a few years
before the legalization in Thailand,
[SPEAKER_01]: which gave a little bit more confidence to
us and to others to be able to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: open up because as I'm sure a lot of you
are aware, the penalties for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging in anything cannabis related in
Thailand before legalization were,
[SPEAKER_01]: were very, very severe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was, yeah, it was really about,
it was about timing and about passion,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about a lot of like-minded individuals
with, you know, a singular target,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that target again, being the
conservation of, of land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a subject which is pretty
easy to be passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's substance, there's
stories, there's, there's so much to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're talking about like going into
the communities and looking up fermented,
[SPEAKER_03]: different fermented drinks, that's
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can you give us an example?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like bang, is that like, do they make
fermented bang and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I've actually never seen a
fermented bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, definitely not out of the bounds
of the imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, we were looking at doing in
this particular context, sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-colonial Indian and Thai recipes and
wondering at our intellectual dishonesty
[SPEAKER_01]: at charging really high prices for French
wine pairings with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a matter of, yeah,
trying to find, you know, different sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of unique things, which we could bring
that value element to the, to the
[SPEAKER_01]: customer, to the person consuming the
beverage of, you know, a complex drink
[SPEAKER_01]: with a good taste and a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a lot of them around,
but unfortunately we don't really find
[SPEAKER_01]: them so much in the big sort of urban city
context where bang might be consumed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and bang is a regulated good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sold in the government shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it outside, of course,
but primarily at least I associate it with
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit more of an urban context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the drinks, we were more in
Chhattisgarh, in Jharkhand, in Orissa,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the tribal region, you know,
mostly grains, rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorites in Thailand is called
sato.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different forms, but essentially
it's a glutinous rice with a little yeast
[SPEAKER_01]: cake called lupeng, which is made from a
bunch of different local herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially you've got a little clay
pot and you add your, your rice and then
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your lupeng and your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill it up with a little bit of water
and then you seal it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top of the jar is sealed off with clay
and that'll be left for a few days and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can just burst, there's like a bamboo
straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: You burst the clay seal and you just pop
it straight in and drink right out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got the most wonderful,
like sour, funky fermentation aromas,
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that provided a really
solid base to push to experiment with
[SPEAKER_01]: infusing different, you know, flavors into
it, making it sparkling, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, the, the equivalent of,
you know, a really expensive wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's something going to be like,
you know, traditional there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: racism in the world of food and,
you know, Thai food, Indian food is very
[SPEAKER_01]: often looked down upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for it to sort of be valued as an
equivalent by something like a Michelin
[SPEAKER_01]: inspector, it needs to really be sort of
extra.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a sommelier, did you guys,
did a lot of the experience with like
[SPEAKER_03]: turpings and stuff cross over into
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end, in my last job, that was
something that we were playing with quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two jobs, actually, I was a
beverage director for a group,
[SPEAKER_01]: which included some cocktail bars and a
couple of restaurants in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were very sort of progressive and
open-minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the owners smoked a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a little bit easier to sort
of swing those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we weren't able to actually roll
it out in the dining room because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: before the legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite, you know, turpings not having
any cannabis, it's not the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: attention that any sort of restaurant has.
[SPEAKER_01]: The restaurant was looking for at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were playing with it because,
you know, apart from the fermented
[SPEAKER_01]: beverages they're talking about,
they have alcohol in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people who don't
consume alcohol in Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were looking, yeah, much more at
doing stuff with tea, botanicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: of which, you know, turpings, key
component in almost any that you look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a stoner, I'm always interested
in sort of, you know, finding some OG Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: taste in some mad tea from somewhere or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you got into the Asian political sphere
and you started making these connections
[SPEAKER_03]: and inroads, what caught you then to move
from maybe as much of a preservation of
[SPEAKER_03]: Thailand races, which was really,
you know, the main starting goal,
[SPEAKER_03]: into working with the farmers and making
sure the farmers are absolutely taken care
[SPEAKER_03]: of?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see those two things as absolutely
synonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I can go in more into detail
if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a lot of conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people tagging their indoor grows as
preservation runs, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing with zoos is that they're
pretty big entities that require a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: coordination and moving parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until the advent of pretty strict
regulations and even despite that,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can be pretty dark places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I think of exit to
conservation, I think of, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: little amateur zoos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a noble effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, the only people who can
grow significant populations of open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated cannabis from land race
genetics is people in the traditional land
[SPEAKER_01]: race growing region.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they don't have to compete to
contend, or at least for now, with all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the licenses that's needed in the West or
in North America and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need to contend, at least until
recently, they didn't need to contend with
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp farms or contamination, those kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hesitant to say that no
preservation can be done outside because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's pretty obvious that it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, the focus seems to be
so much on getting seeds out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional growing regions and into
cryogenic storage or into long term
[SPEAKER_01]: growing facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not much thought going into
actually just helping out the farmers who
[SPEAKER_01]: are growing land races in the traditional
growing regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keeping them growing these
traditional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're already doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of places, including in Thailand,
people are coming over and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, well, listen, we need to teach these
guys how to be more profitable so they can
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of keep up with the modern industry,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the solution answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, this is not the solution either.
[SPEAKER_01]: By modernizing and changing either the
target of their growth, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: to move away from tariffs to dry sift and
bubble hash in Parvati and other places,
[SPEAKER_01]: it changes the way that the selections are
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite being maybe quite subtle,
they have long lasting consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ultimately, we'd be looking at
providing essentially a subsidy for
[SPEAKER_01]: growers that are growing a product which
unfortunately is not profitable in the
[SPEAKER_01]: modern marketplace, but has significant
value for the community and industry as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And giving them that incentive to make the
choice to grow these land races despite
[SPEAKER_01]: the disadvantages that are created by
legislation, policy, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ultimately, everybody has families
to take care of and wants to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when faced with a choice of,
or not necessarily the choice,
[SPEAKER_01]: when faced with having a long-standing
land race growth, no more customers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and knowing that all it would take is to
switch to a modern cultivar for your
[SPEAKER_01]: market to suddenly open up, that's a
choice which almost every land race farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: is facing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to give them a reason to be
like hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep doing what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of reminds me a little bit of the
multi-state operators dropping the prices
[SPEAKER_01]: below a sustainable price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they can afford to sustain
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like the same situation with the
land race farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like everybody sort of recognizes the
value of what they have, but nobody's
[SPEAKER_01]: really willing to actually hook them up or
even able really to buy their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just kind of going to
disappear in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we hope to address and to
redress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we do essentially is we
approach the, it depends who we're
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, but if we can, we're approaching
the community as a whole, the village
[SPEAKER_01]: elder or village chief or whatever the
equivalent is, and coming up with some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of agreement for them to continue
growing land races and for us to make an
[SPEAKER_01]: attempt at offering their germplasm and
seeds to the international community for
[SPEAKER_01]: which to breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is that people back home don't
need to be concerned with conservation if
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually let the pros take care of it
in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can have fun creating all
the crazy hybrids from the phenohunt,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can be done each year in such a
genetically diverse population,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the way we see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole way that you approach it is very
just socially conscious to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that's been lacking a
lot in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people that I've seen
over the years tend to maybe, I don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to say exploit the farmers, but it's hard
to say anything other than that because
[SPEAKER_03]: they try to get the cheapest absolute
price so that they can then take a cut off
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds over the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how they make their money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it all goes back to what is the
incentive for the farmers to keep growing
[SPEAKER_03]: these when people come to them without
using any of the names, like a big seed
[SPEAKER_03]: company from Amsterdam that says,
hey, we'd rather you have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give us your land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll store these in germ plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can grow some of these feminized seeds
in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how things disappear for good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate your work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that we're going to be able
to prevent the land races going extinct,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, but we'll definitely do
what we can with the communities that are
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to work with us to try and keep
what we can for as long as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, it's going to require a
concerted effort on behalf of the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, there needs to be a demand for
terroir-driven products and a clear
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of what terroir-driven
products are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, I think a lot of people,
they want to have that experience of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian gold or the Thai stick that they
had back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that was all imported
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want to return to experiences
like that, we need to consider a
[SPEAKER_01]: normalization of trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since that's so, so far away, it seems to
make sense to support the land race
[SPEAKER_01]: growers in the meantime by breeding with
their genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's define land race as you see it,
as you understand it, because that's super
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I hate to do that, actually,
because, well, not I don't hate to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just think that there's a lot of
opinions and a lot of words out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why we need to reinvent the
wheel every time, you know, like my take
[SPEAKER_01]: is not as interesting or I think as
accurate as the numerous studies which
[SPEAKER_01]: have been published over the last few
decades, you know, dealing with land races
[SPEAKER_01]: and also specifically defining land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that I can't actually
remember the name of the authors of the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a paper called towards an evolved
concept of land races, which basically
[SPEAKER_01]: it's looking at the history of the
definition of the term and making a
[SPEAKER_01]: proposal that land races should be
considered as basically dynamic
[SPEAKER_01]: population, which can be subjected to
introgression while still retaining their
[SPEAKER_01]: designation as land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important because the earliest
definition of land race, von Grumker,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, but even, you know,
until Zevin, which I think was 1998,
[SPEAKER_01]: were much more about static, you know,
the land race is a monolithic,
[SPEAKER_01]: never changing thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it becomes polluted, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's the case, then they're
destined for the museum and they'll never,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's not my, that's a quote
from the paper, you know, they'll never
[SPEAKER_01]: get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one sense, that makes a lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one side, that makes a lot of sense to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other, I think that the implication
of this sort of evolved understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: land races is underlined by a worldview or
sorry, maybe sort of a structured by a
[SPEAKER_01]: worldview, which cannot consider a future
where indigenous people might be sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: left in peace to grow alone, you know,
like the paper can't even consider that,
[SPEAKER_01]: which bothers me fundamentally because as
a naive dreamer, I suppose I'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine a future where, you know,
everybody could be left alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose that is somewhat unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, given the context,
the capitalism will continue to expand
[SPEAKER_01]: into every single possible market that it
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Land race, cannabis in traditional growing
regions, far away from the nearest road.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if that's the case, then I think
that that paper does make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are going to integrate these
communities into the global economy and
[SPEAKER_01]: their crops into the global economy as
commodities, then certainly there needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be some sort of new look at how we define
land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would basically say, yeah, go read the
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go read the studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't listen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got nothing fresh to say on the
definition of land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm a bit boring on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to defer to the scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a great answer because,
you know, some people will insert their
[SPEAKER_03]: opinions as facts, state it very
confidently, and that's that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the real answer is, man, just got to
check out the research and stay up to date
[SPEAKER_03]: with the research, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, because it's changing,
you know, and it has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way we interpret the study
ourselves, you know, the I read it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somehow we come up with two slightly
different conclusions, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would rather instead of because I see
that something that's happening a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm constantly having these conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like instead of constantly
reinventing the wheel and giving our
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions as to what the definitions of
these things are, we should maybe be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: more reading as a community and seeing
what, you know, the biologists have to say
[SPEAKER_01]: about land races, because there's a lot of
work done for corn land races,
[SPEAKER_01]: for weeds, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite the fact that there's very few
cannabis specific studies, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of studies on similar organisms,
hops, et cetera, that we can learn a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people that are watching this,
probably one of the reasons they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to come to watch a show about Thailand
races.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked about this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the chocolate tie?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always the first question I get.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked with a line called chocolate
tie from a dude named Draw, who's supposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to be sourced it from the people that DNA
Don and Aaron sourced it from to make
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, of course, all these fantastic
legends and fables of pasta dipped,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, heroin infused cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all these tales of what chocolate
tie is in your experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you learned about chocolate pie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the message here is
that in Thailand, the area which produced
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, the largest area, Isan,
was incredibly like really, really poor
[SPEAKER_01]: until quite recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea that farmers were sort of
walking around eating Nestle chocolate and
[SPEAKER_01]: naming things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that no one had ever heard
of chocolate in Isan in the 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's an English word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, in my opinion, a pretty sort of
pretty clearly it's foreigners who,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, had some accession or some
selection or bags of weed with seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, and they had, you know,
a chocolate, I really, because I really
[SPEAKER_01]: can't speak on DNA or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all I can speak of is, you know,
having gone through the motions myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: asking pretty much everybody that I can,
you know, deal with chocolate tie and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, being met with the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One issue is that a lot of the traditional
knowledge here in Thailand has sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly been sort of dissipating and
becoming unstructured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the young ones are learning
from the same sources that we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll meet some, especially ethnic
pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they'll be maybe aware of chocolate
pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe if you rocked up to Thailand in
a few years ago and you asked for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would have got something and they
would have told you it was chocolate pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak for anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I can say is that as far as large
open pollinated populations of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that we could describe as land race,
that the farmer are sort of engaging with
[SPEAKER_01]: and in their head, conceiving of as
chocolate tie, that doesn't exist as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I can say though, to give people some
hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And context on what might have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the aroma of chocolate,
also that of coffee, dark, earthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: musty aromas are very typical of narrow
leaf drug type land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's been subjected to compression
curing, which I think a lot of you will
[SPEAKER_01]: know as tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess when you have this sort of
this mechanical pressure plus temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: plus time, we see significant impact on
the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we can add anaerobic conditions on
occasion, aging underground or these days
[SPEAKER_01]: in vacuum seals, we do see some pretty
funky aromas coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that's quite consistent is
sort of earthy, chocolatey character.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I've had a lot in my
time in Southeast Asia, in Laos,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Cambodia and Myanmar and elsewhere with
the older six months plus cured stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't want to speculate too much,
but I think it would be interesting if it
[SPEAKER_01]: turned out to be some sort of terpene,
which was sort of maybe biosynthesized.
[SPEAKER_01]: During this aging process and was leading
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also be a combination of
different compounds, which are leading to
[SPEAKER_01]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's definitely something to
research there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for those interested in the
chocolate pie, your best bet is the Fino
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt, the Lao Isan gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for that, you can approach squirrel
tail, tiger tail, Thai mango, snake teeth,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll find pretty consistently
applying these compression curing
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques that you'll have these
chocolate aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're delicious, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you nail it, you're looking at a slow
degradation of the chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving almost everything else intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've got a very smooth smoke,
which doesn't have this sort of full green
[SPEAKER_01]: character, which chlorophyll brings,
which is so ubiquitous, the smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say as a note, just as sort of
curiosity, a couple of times we've had
[SPEAKER_01]: some professional sommeliers coming into
our, we're partnered with a dispensary in
[SPEAKER_01]: Bangkok and they have a total of 64
strains in the shop right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we let all the sommeliers smell them
and they're like, yeah, next, next,
[SPEAKER_01]: next, next, next.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to the compression cured Lao gold
land race and they're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's the only one that doesn't smell
green and doesn't have that chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in wine, green is an aroma that's very
sort of, it's viewed as a form of law
[SPEAKER_01]: almost universally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I think that there's
something to be explored there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's a reason why so
many people are in love with this
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate Thai, with the myth of it,
with the story, because there is something
[SPEAKER_01]: there that's rewarding, delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think it's a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: A strain, it's proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's interesting is growing up
here and in the 90s, earlier like 90s,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting a lot of Mexican compressed brick,
constant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that Mexican compressed brick,
I've always said it smelled like minty
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate, but definitely a cocoa type
smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it was compression cured and
sat forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of speaks to what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned, of course, the infamous
tiger tail, squirrel tail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we start talking about some of these
different, what you would call like maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: an expression of these different land
races or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gotten really confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the picture that I'm trying to
paint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I'm explaining it's probably going
to be a bit confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm explaining is very confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, the first attestation to the
word squirrel tail in the Lao script that
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw was in reference to traditional kip
weaving, which is a style, but squirrel
[SPEAKER_01]: tail is a pattern found in traditional kip
weaving, which today is practiced in silk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one day I'd like to find if I
can a traditional Thai historic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a weaving historian,
if that exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they make it with hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my immediate hunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, squirrel tail, the tiger tail,
these are many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all down to the Lao, Isan,
we can call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on both sides of the Mekong,
in Thailand and Laos, live Lao speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Thai side, it's referred to as the
region of Isan or the Korat Plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, the words that are used
to describe cannabis of a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: archetype, are squirrel tail, tiger tail,
etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So squirrel tail describes like a big
cheerleader, like pom-pom style buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like really like big,
like lots of leaves, like puffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the tiger tail is the,
it's more like the creeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it referred to in English as a
creeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Robert Clark described creepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a lot of lateral branching low
to the ground with these branches
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes forming new roots and then big
swoopy main colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And strangely, the English translation for
tiger tail is sometimes rendered as
[SPEAKER_01]: rudder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure who got confused,
the English speakers of the Thai,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some of the Thais have also been
telling me that, no, this is rudder as in
[SPEAKER_01]: like boat rudder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something they'd be most used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but in that sense,
I'm thinking just like a long upright
[SPEAKER_01]: rigid object, but you know, cause if you
look at some of the tiger tail,
[SPEAKER_01]: they really do like, they have this huge
main top cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the branching is already low to
the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is quite, as with a lot of these
things, there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: stories, but so far, you know,
the, we were able to differentiate between
[SPEAKER_01]: the structure on these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the structure for the snake
teeth, which is the vine-like growth kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like Dr. Grinspoon, where you have a
running calic structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the mango would be the,
you know, the mercy and rich accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also pretty common to find mango
aromas in squirrel tail, tiger tail and
[SPEAKER_01]: the snake teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, I think that originally it
would have been a singular gene pool,
[SPEAKER_01]: which during its dissemination and the
cross cultural contact between the Thais,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Lao and other groups in the region,
seeds were exchanged, plants were
[SPEAKER_01]: exchanged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ended up with both autochthonous,
you know, land-raised population,
[SPEAKER_01]: big open pollinated population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, autochthonous and allochthonous in
different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bunch of inbred lines, some single plants,
reproductions from single seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, multiplied into millions and
then disseminated and then a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them carry the same names.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's best understood,
you know, as archetypes within the gene
[SPEAKER_01]: pool that have since become established as
their own land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases more like modern strains
as an IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them coexisting temporally and
geographically, in some cases pollinating
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like really, really,
really complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically have done our best to ignore
everything that we sort of hear and focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on what we see and look for large open
pollinated populations that breed true.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to have, you know, seem to
express what we consider to look more like
[SPEAKER_01]: a primordial character.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, as long as the population
size is big enough and it's grown in open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination, then, you know, that fits the
base criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're looking to collect from
everything, but what we're sort of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in heavily is what we can
determine to be the more, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: use the word pure because it's not
accurate, but the stuff which is grown
[SPEAKER_01]: properly, managed properly, and not just,
you know, every single little thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because honestly, it's a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point since legalization,
every single uncle, you know, whoever had
[SPEAKER_01]: a single plant in his back garden,
making seeds and selling them,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people are selling clones for
about 30 cents a clone on the side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: street in Bangkok out of little trucks and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's this really intense sort of
mixing and hybridization of everything
[SPEAKER_01]: going on at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just sort of the culmination of
the last 40, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as far as the Lao Isan gene pool is
concerned, we've been looking at plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, look like a squirrel tail,
look like a tiger tail and are kept in big
[SPEAKER_01]: open pollinated growth in fairly remote
regions where we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically that's taken us out of Isan
for the most part and into the more hilly
[SPEAKER_01]: regions where we can find that,
you know, we can get that distance that's
[SPEAKER_01]: required to, you know, to totally prevent
the the cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've done, you've done a lot of work
in Thailand to, you know, try to pick
[SPEAKER_03]: apart a lot of these stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time, it seems like Xomi has kind
of spread out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other areas that you've been
really excited about that you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: looking into?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've talked about, you know,
around Thailand, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there other places in there that
you're excited about or elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambodia is, you know, the place that I
spent the most time personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a really soft spot for Cambodia
and one of my best friends are Cambodian
[SPEAKER_01]: people that, you know, they were little
rascals and now they're big rascals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking forward to being able to
return there probably this year and look
[SPEAKER_01]: at what we can do to expand our
collection, try and see if we can recruit
[SPEAKER_01]: some different communities into the
collective and bring up some new seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, Laos, you know, that's always
one of the most interesting regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, you know, the Thai nationalism
prevents them from admitting how good the
[SPEAKER_01]: Laotian weed is and the Laotian reverse
with the Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of synergy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Laos has a few iconic areas
producing, you know, land-raised cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're really looking forward to go
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, the sea pandan,
the 4,000 islands, which is basically an
[SPEAKER_01]: area of the Mekong where there's cataracts
on the border with Cambodia and Laos and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mekong spreads out into these loads of
islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a pretty well-known tourist
destination, a place where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, fond memories of kicking
back and fishing and smoking grape pots
[SPEAKER_01]: from the 60s onwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has, you know, there's not a lot of
places left on the Mekong, the islands
[SPEAKER_01]: which grow this beautiful golden weed,
which all the old-timers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's probably going to be one of
the priorities in terms of where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily grown within the main
areas, but, you know, along the cataract,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of people growing here and
there, and we're looking forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: getting some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, golden Mekong weed, Laos,
that's going to be, I think that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a big hit with the old-timers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of stuff in the north of
the country near the border with Yunnan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the Bolavn Plateau,
that's a beautiful coffee-growing region
[SPEAKER_01]: with a significant amount of local
population belonging to the Laven ethnic
[SPEAKER_01]: group, who are very talented cannabis
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much in Laos that we can
explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a very, very diverse country,
very small, but with a lot of diversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and the people, the landscapes
and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myanmar, unfortunately, is, you know,
I mean, it feels a bit silly saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, in the context of seeds,
because that's not really what makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: sad, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Myanmar is undergoing, you know,
severe political upheaval, civil war.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody, you know, wants to help out,
they're taking volunteers in Chiang Mai
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go and sign up to go fight for the
militias that are fighting against the
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolute chaos out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been getting really, really,
really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're not doing anything in
Myanmar right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't sound very safe right now,
or, I mean, people's priorities are
[SPEAKER_03]: different right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People's priorities are different,
and we don't feel like, well, we've spoken
[SPEAKER_01]: to our contacts out there, and we
theoretically could get seeds out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it just, again, it doesn't seem like a
priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the priority probably seems to be
for us now to continue focusing on our
[SPEAKER_01]: work in Cambodia, Laos, and in the
northeast of India, in Mizoram,
[SPEAKER_01]: Tripura, Nagaland, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also very, very excited to be
bringing out some Colombian genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully, soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, we're all very excited about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of similarities with the
tie, it seems, between, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Caribbean and Latin American gene
pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking forward to having closer
collaboration with us and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, members of our collective in that
group, and together try to build a better
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of, you know, what's going on with
the land races between the two regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are similarities in the semi-outdoor
curing styles with golden wheat as a
[SPEAKER_01]: result, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, our boys are based in Calca,
but they're mobile, so we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to bringing out some genetics from
there pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure the next drop, well,
the current drop is Wawati.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just came back from Himachal,
Pradesh, but I think next is gonna be,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, in that order, Thailand,
Cambodia, Laos, followed by India again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we talk about some of the current
recent accessions that you got that are on
[SPEAKER_03]: your site right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people have an understanding from you,
other than what you write, which is,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, that's kind of what initially drew
me to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a good friend of Neville's sent
me to your site and said, you've got to
[SPEAKER_03]: check these guys out, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, this is legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did, and it's not just descriptions,
like, lulling you in with, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: words and marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how you collected it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how you listed the accessions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done very well, like, in my opinion,
very scientifically and all the details
[SPEAKER_03]: that people need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people will, of course,
be wondering, like, what does this taste
[SPEAKER_03]: and smell like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the THC content?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, what's the high?
[SPEAKER_03]: And not understanding that, like,
they're thinking of it from a very modern
[SPEAKER_03]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this going to be like in my room
indoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just, it's not something you can
really tell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how this plant grows outdoors in
this, expresses in this environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: how it's going to be indoors in your
environment where it's never been,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So please talk about some of your more
recent accessions and what people can
[SPEAKER_03]: expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, like you said, we don't really
put, you know, like, expected yields or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we do go into terpene profiles a
little bit, but, you know, not massively
[SPEAKER_01]: and certainly not THC percentages or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to note that, you know,
we've found some accessions in Cambodia,
[SPEAKER_01]: which have very few trichome heads on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they absolutely flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm just going to go ahead and go
on a limb and say that maybe there's even
[SPEAKER_01]: some other cannabinoids that play there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, measuring, you know,
that strange quality or that accession's
[SPEAKER_01]: quality based on its THC percentage just
seems like an absurdity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many missing cannabinoids out
there like that we don't, that aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: tested for.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no clue what is causing some of
these highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for as far as the most recent
accessions, we were in Parvati Valley,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, one of the true
hotspots of land races in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maybe not as much of a priority as
far as conservation goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmers there are pretty, pretty well
off and doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they don't really need our help
in the same way that farmers in Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to us because Parvati
is one of the most visible, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most famous of the growing regions in the
whole world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, without having,
you know, a few pictures and some
[SPEAKER_01]: accessions from Malana, it's really hard
to have that clout as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a land race collective, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that where Malana is in Parvati Valley
or is it called a valley?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Parvati is in the state of Himachal
Pradesh, which basically means like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the Himachal province.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Himachal is like a heavenly mountain,
I believe, in Bihari.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the, it's, you know, the place
outside of Kathmandu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically a lot of Parvati Valley is in
Himachal Pradesh, which is in the north of
[SPEAKER_01]: India near the border with China and not
so far away from Pakistan, Kashmir is in
[SPEAKER_01]: between.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the northwest of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically a hub for cannabis
growing since the 1960s as one of the sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of the tail ends of the hippie trail,
you know, other than Kathmandu and Nepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And starting, I'm not exactly sure when,
but you know, I would say maybe late 70s,
[SPEAKER_01]: early 80s, a lot of Italians coming to
Parvati, La Paz and Malana villages in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, and getting involved with
Charis production there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's had a big international
reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Europe, Parvati hash is not
necessarily the most common, but in a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of places in Italy, in the Scandinavian
countries, is one of the prestige hash
[SPEAKER_01]: that is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for us, it, it's, it seemed like,
you know, a very, a priority, let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, because, you know, when
foreigners are learning and educating
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves about land races, one of the
first places that they learn about is
[SPEAKER_01]: generally Malana, Kasol, Tosh,
this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, we felt like in order to bring
attention to smaller villages in other
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of India and in other countries in
Thailand, that it was in the best interest
[SPEAKER_01]: of approaching and working with the
farmers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but the farmers there,
they're not, conservation is needed
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, but Malana and maybe not
Malana, but Parvati Valley as a whole is
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the more stable, one of the larger
land race producing regions, the people
[SPEAKER_01]: there are holding on to their traditions
pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not necessarily an area where
we can engage in necessarily the same type
[SPEAKER_01]: of conservation work that we can in tribal
regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the north east of India or elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's somewhere where we, you know,
could source some very high quality seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from very, very famous gardens,
maybe, you know, do our part in helping to
[SPEAKER_01]: build up the body of knowledge for what
could eventually be an appellation system
[SPEAKER_01]: in the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that, that in particular is
something that on a personal level,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it'd be a privilege to be
involved in anything even remote to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Parvati is one of the,
the grand cru, so to speak, of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, it's a storied place
with a big diversity of, in French,
[SPEAKER_01]: we call them leudy and clima.
[SPEAKER_01]: They refer to the smallest geographic
designation, basically individual plots,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes having multiple within one
vineyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, in Parvati, we see a
similar system with very small individual
[SPEAKER_01]: plots, making up a constellation that
forms a larger sort of system that spreads
[SPEAKER_01]: out the whole valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that provides us with a lot of
different expressions, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: of that gene pool from the various sort of
terroir of the area, whether they be the
[SPEAKER_01]: dark side of the valley with a lot of
humidity, a lot of rain, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best, most sunny spots at high
altitude above Malana village,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in total, we made 74 accessions,
which I, maybe it's, I don't need to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just want to point out like how much
tracking was involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, gardens that are, you know,
between let's say 2,100 to 3,000,
[SPEAKER_01]: 4,000 meters, basically at the highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between, well, like 6,000 to almost
12,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the villages, for example,
Tosh, maybe I don't actually know the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact altitude of Tosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rasol is 2,600 or so and the Vairam
fields above it are hitting 3,000,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you need to get up to Rasol and
then up to the fields beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similarly to in Southeast Asia,
where next to the rice fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's these little huts where they dry
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the products and where they rest
during the hot parts of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's rubbing houses in a lot of the
higher fields in Parvati.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the time we were hanging
out with the boys there and asking them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, you know, what's the name
of this garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the name of that garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, can you make sure you separate
plants from those two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time you rub, we'll, we'll give you
more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, they think we're stupid because
they're like, why would the foreigner pay
[SPEAKER_01]: more just for knowing that it comes from
one garden and not the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're like, let's put some
fucking stamps on the charas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very Western mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's rewarding and it helps
the farmers to differentiate their product
[SPEAKER_01]: without having any change on the product
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps us, again, to bring a better,
clearer picture of what is going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene pool in that area and to represent
that visually, the text and with our
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were telling a story yesterday about
hand rubbing that I thought was
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the one thing that like as,
as a person who might have a few OCDs,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the idea of hand rubbing,
like to me is, is skin cells and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that drives me nuts, but I understand
the tradition and the quality that goes
[SPEAKER_03]: along with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had an interesting story about
like how bad it can corrupt your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me a little bit about that so
people can understand what goes into this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually what I didn't mean to
emphasize that honestly, like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the eyelashes are more of a
concern than really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you like, you'll never even really
see the skin cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just notice that your hands feel a
bit papery and thin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, if you let them dry
out afterwards, they'll get all ragged.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you'll often notice little
eyelashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're always hunched over when
they're, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when they're rubbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, you know, everybody,
all the foreigners, they come up to
[SPEAKER_01]: Parvati for the first time and they have
it in their head that they're going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, run naked through the field of
weed, maybe something like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably could, if you wanted to,
I mean, you'd get some there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also want to say before I,
before I say anything else, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause a lot of these conversations in the
past have led to people going to where
[SPEAKER_01]: we've talked about on the back of me
explaining where the grows are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Milano Valley and you touch
any plants, expect to pay about a $500
[SPEAKER_01]: fine for every plant that you touch every
time you touch one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not so keen on foreigners coming
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in other places, you can, yeah,
probably run naked through the fields as
[SPEAKER_01]: you imagine you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, the, the first thing is
like, okay, well, I'm not going to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: hash while I'm here because I'm a cannabis
nerd and I know how it's made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to rub it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wake up early and you go up and rub
and rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll notice that unless you're doing
this regularly, it takes a big toll on
[SPEAKER_01]: your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes are somewhat caustic and
you're applying a lot of pressure onto
[SPEAKER_01]: your palms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically when you're collecting
the matter at the end, you're pressing
[SPEAKER_01]: your thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is it pretty bad on your joints
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you'll notice blisters on your
thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your technique isn't on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think that, yeah, for people who
have, have these kinds of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, whether it's OCD or just,
you know, being concerned about hygiene,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is reasonable, you know,
I get that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even see the skin cells,
but like, even when I, when I'm like doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that at home, like going through picking
seeds and I've got like caked,
[SPEAKER_03]: caked to resin on my hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking, what if I smoke this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but also, also knowing about
Melada cream that is like in my mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: like supposed to be what the ultimate
hash, what I understand of a lot of cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's like, there's no way any skin
cell would make me pass up some Melada
[SPEAKER_03]: cream to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the top level cream will have
very few skin cells in it because the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole point of cream is for it to be very
delicately rubbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so when you do rub it delicately,
there's, you know, and also we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you know, for, for someone with
soft hands who doesn't rub every year,
[SPEAKER_01]: then yeah, it's going to be filled with
skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a very calloused hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will say though that during the
season you'll find the whole village is
[SPEAKER_01]: empties and you know, in a way you could,
it's child exploitation or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean, it's not really like they have
such thing as childcare up in the hills
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll leave the kids at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come with and the whole family rubs
and you better believe that the dad is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to tell you later, like,
yo, this was my 16 year old daughter who
[SPEAKER_01]: rubbed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her hands are really soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pay more for this, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always like, no, no, this is the
youngest, you know, the, this is my wife
[SPEAKER_01]: or it's always the wife or daughter who
gets the highest prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very typical though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there like, you mentioned Columbia,
is there any other like pie in the sky,
[SPEAKER_03]: like ideas you want to pull off with Omea
that you haven't yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we'd like to, I mean, a lot of things
we'd love to, to get more into the
[SPEAKER_01]: production and aging and then selling of
tie stick and charris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those are what we're passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditional compression curing and
traditional hand rubbing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the artisanal crafts, um,
which don't involve the mediation of many
[SPEAKER_01]: tools or machinery, um, in the elaboration
of traditional cannabis, products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always going to be something that
we want to get involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, maybe if you'll allow me,
want to go back a little bit to Milana,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, yeah, no, I think, I think that
there's a bit more nuance that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: explained here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the cream, the charris is rubbed
from domesticate plants, um, which over
[SPEAKER_01]: the course of the last 25 years in
particular, every single farmer who has
[SPEAKER_01]: been around long enough to see it talks
about a decline in THC levels and in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it went from being a lesser amount
of plants needed to rub 10 grams to a much
[SPEAKER_01]: higher amount of 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my personal experiences in India
were not in Parvati Valley, actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: first ones, um, they were in mostly in
Kinnaar and Spiti, um, in the more remote
[SPEAKER_01]: regions of Himachal Pradesh, where there's
much less of a tourist drug trade and much
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a local traditional consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, there, the charris is referred
to as jungly, uh, jungly being the word
[SPEAKER_01]: which gave us the word in English for
jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means forest in Hindi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and is forest hash in that regards can
be thought of as hash rubbed from feral
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the hash rub from feral plants,
in my opinion, that is the pinnacle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world of charris because not only have the
domesticate plants been losing,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I can't really explain much more about
why, but the, the, the, the testimony of
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmers that they're, they're losing,
um, THC content over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereas the feral plants are becoming
irrelevant with very few people outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, for example, in Kulu, which is at
the bottom of the valley, um, it's a much
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger city.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's outside of Parvati.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find, um, drug addicts like,
you know, going and rubbing hands worth
[SPEAKER_01]: from the feral plants on, you know,
the dusty ass plants on the side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but more and more in the main,
sorry, of producing villages like Rasol,
[SPEAKER_01]: Malana, there are far less feral plants
now than there were before, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: feral plants are often the first to be
targeted in, in eradication campaigns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the cops will come and put a
little bit of pressure and the cops
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves probably won't be clearing the
field, but they'll be telling the
[SPEAKER_01]: villagers to clear the fields and they'll
clear the feral plants below the village
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in plain view of the path that
goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that doesn't satisfy the
cops then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll cut down a few domesticate
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that really the sort of the
pinnacle, the Holy grail, whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to call it is the, the jungly is the,
and not all jungly is equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be from a, from an Augustin
who can rub very well and can rub a good
[SPEAKER_01]: quality cream slowly without much
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if he rubs from feral plants,
um, you can expect a bigger diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and terpenes, um,
which, you know, when consumed fresh or
[SPEAKER_01]: aged to much more pronounced and distinct
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think that's where the magic of,
of, of Parvati and Charis in general is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is live resin made from, you know,
live plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, funnily enough, all the, all the Gora,
you know, all the foreigners, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty excited about consuming it fresh
because that's when it's really terpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but also quite caustic on the throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: All locals swear by smoking it after a
year when it's lost a lot of its taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's much smoother and provides a more
repetitive narcotic kind of effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think so too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love going out there and trying all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the locals are like,
you're like, cause they don't have some
[SPEAKER_01]: of, they produce a lot, but they don't
produce a lot of the best grades.
[SPEAKER_01]: You normally need to commission that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted say a few kilos of super
cream or something, you'd need to come in
[SPEAKER_01]: advance and say, I want you to make and
you need to trust and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're sort of going there on
the spot and asking them, give me your
[SPEAKER_01]: best stuff, you're kind of like,
don't smoke it too quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, here, I'm on a mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try everything as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you better believe, you know,
yeah, dude, man, I, you know, usually my,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my co-host Nata with me and right
now I would be making a joke about sending
[SPEAKER_03]: him over to suitcase some lot of cream and
bring it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That the old traditional suitcase,
if you get my drift,
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back in, uh, I was in Denmark
for a little brief period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, she met a Danish chick and they're
pretty famous for bringing, bringing the
[SPEAKER_01]: dudes back to Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, they got this little hippie
commune there that sort of, or anarchist
[SPEAKER_01]: commune that, um, well, it's changed a
lot, but basically there's kind of this
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace and it's all, it's changed a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but back in the day, I remember there
was always, um, like ass hash or briefcase
[SPEAKER_01]: hash, um, like eggs or super flat or
bricks of Kashmiri that came.
[SPEAKER_01]: God knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was always like the briefcase hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often did you choose the ass hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I don't like, you know,
like, you know, like, uh, there's that
[SPEAKER_01]: study with Madrid where they found that
like every sample of, uh, of hash that
[SPEAKER_01]: they found was contaminated fecal matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever heard of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I think, you know, I'm not,
that's definitely not something I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in order to maybe sort of
contextualize this and, um, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else that might seem a little bit odd
about hygiene that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think I'd like to sort of,
um, explain a little bit about how,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, an analogy in winemaking
would maybe be the most, uh, illustrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's that when you have an old
winery with, you know, very porous walls
[SPEAKER_01]: from an old traditional building,
you know, one that wasn't built,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, up to code or according to what
some bureaucrats wanted, just traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: building, you know, people knocked it up
because they needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those walls will accumulate yeast and
all these things over long, long periods
[SPEAKER_01]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're talking about a country
which has, you know, a heavy bureaucracy,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when it comes to things like
food products, you know, the U S does not
[SPEAKER_01]: allow like, I mean, maybe this has
changed, but I remember like it was a big
[SPEAKER_01]: deal that the U S didn't allow like raw
cow's milk cheese, which is like the best
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live, you know, lactic, uh, bacteria
culture leads to much more complexity of
[SPEAKER_01]: taste and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there are huge, big hygiene,
you know, concerns in the U S which
[SPEAKER_01]: confuses me because I also get told on the
other side that standards are lax compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think, without being a chauvinist
or without trying to, um, I'd like to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I guess, praise the,
the, the, the Europeans for having that
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of, uh, ability to be very hygienic
when they think that it matters for
[SPEAKER_01]: example, during the harvesting of the
grapes and everything else, but allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: certain contaminants during other parts of
the process because they're either a part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the traditional method or they have
some sort of an impact on the taste or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that regards, I kind of place the skin
cells in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, if you're a craft beer drinker,
you'll probably seen the Brett beer that's
[SPEAKER_01]: came about in the last sort of 10 years or
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, um, we describe it as like
barnyard aromas and smells, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we find it very typically in,
well, it's, it's caused by a bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: infection, which you can get rid of
through proper hygiene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it a lot in French wines and you
know, the Americans, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have tasting panels when the
supermarkets are going to buy like onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the side of the leader of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, and it took,
you know, decades and for the craft beer
[SPEAKER_01]: hipsters to come out and be like,
no, these bacterias are actually okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to incorporate them,
you know, voluntarily into the beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's those things in your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a big difference sort of,
um, there's a big difference in,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the, the way that traditional products
are conceived of and the requirements,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of people, um,
where I come from might say that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: create a formula and you sanitize
everything, then it can't express the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil and the culture and the life,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so bear that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel a little bit disgusted by
finger hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, it's one of those things
where it's like, Hey, I can't see it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in the back of my mind, it's always
there, you know, someone's proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I will, I'll tell you what,
what you really should worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, this is a significant concern
actually is, is adulterance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, adulterance, um, caused by the,
I mean, the size of the, of the fields in
[SPEAKER_01]: place like Parvati or in Uttrakhand,
they've increased massively, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 fold to a hundred fold or in different
places over the course of the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they still can't quite meet,
um, demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's always,
there's sort of a lack of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, in Parvati, the backstop
is made up by, um, Nepalese who themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: make up the, the laboring class in
Himachal Pradesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also often rub hash on contract
for Himachali landowners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they can't meet their quotas,
they'll incorporate a little bit of Nepali
[SPEAKER_01]: hash into, into the Milana to bulk it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can get a better price per gram
from their landlord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then down in the, in the valley,
it's definitely being contaminated or
[SPEAKER_01]: adulterated.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all sorts of things like duke,
like incense sticks, um, henna,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, just mud, um, random crap,
um, just in order to, to, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bulk it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, explain why they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows why they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you're getting on the top quality
and you know, it's not adulterated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you need to make sure,
you know, you're probably going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: rub it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're worried about hygiene is that
they do stuff like when they're first
[SPEAKER_01]: starting, they'll rub their eyebrows in
order to get some oil on their fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll provide the first,
um, you know, cause what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is you're trying to lift the trichomes
off of the, off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the, they need, you need good
weather conditions and you need your hands
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the, basically the perfect humidity
and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're too dry or something,
it's not going to rub properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your hands do need to be conditioned,
somehow the easiest way is to spit on them
[SPEAKER_01]: or to rub your hair, to rub behind your
ears, to rub your eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most oily part of your face.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to save them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, honestly, I probably
shouldn't be saying this stuff on,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's the truth, you know, it's a part
of the culture and how it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, when you're combusting it,
you're burning the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand the icky part of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it's, it's just one of those
things as an OCD person like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can get over it pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just think back to the shit that
was in like hard drugs that I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like the finger, like worrying
about skin compared to some of the cut
[SPEAKER_03]: that was in hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just, it seems silly, but yeah,
there we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people that are going to be
going to your site after watching the
[SPEAKER_01]: show, which is ZomiaCannabisCo.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: ZomiaCannabisCo.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do start by consensus and the
consensus was an unwieldy and cumbersome
[SPEAKER_01]: website name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the advantages of being
a collective led by consensus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, ZomiaCannabisCo.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the first questions that people
are going to be asking, and I know you're
[SPEAKER_03]: probably going to get a hundred emails
about this after.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I figured maybe let's just try to curb
some of the emails.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's one of the lines you would
recommend for a California indoor garden?
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoor light garden from your selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that there's like, it's kind of
like the Chinese restaurants in the UK or
[SPEAKER_01]: the US, you know, people feel more
comfortable with kind of like an
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediary or familiarity of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet and diversion perhaps a little bit
less spicy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that regards, I think some of
the Landrace IBLs can be quite appropriate
[SPEAKER_01]: for growers who lack the confidence to
approach, you know, a long flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: varietal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that regards, the classic sort of
lowland tie stick accession from us would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the Dai Deng, which is the
transliteration for red thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the legendary red thread tie sticks
from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with a clan from Acompanom
who, you know, have been working with old
[SPEAKER_01]: seed stock reproducing in a pretty large
population now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since quite a few years before
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would be a little bit,
you know, shorter flowering a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more, it's still going to have a
lot of vigor, but it's going to be a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more uniform in its canopy and its growth
patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as far as the sort of the very
equatorial lines, I think that would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: really approachable line for beginners
saying that the picture, I think that's on
[SPEAKER_01]: the background here of the, of the post of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a skull Karen genetics from the
Kinkajan National Park area on the border
[SPEAKER_01]: with Myanmar and Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it's huge plant grows really
vigorously, you know, resistant to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to walk much, don't need to
feed it much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just grows like hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if space isn't your concern,
you know, then, you know, you can consider
[SPEAKER_01]: going for something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, if you're working with
really stretchy long flowering varietals
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, there are quite a few tricks
that you can take to both shorten the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering and to manage the canopy more
evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can get a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to be wanting this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I would say that if you have the
ability, if you're not a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, or even if you are, and you have
the ability to sacrifice a space for a
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle in order to do phenohunts,
I think that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of, you know, stabilizing phenos
and also you're going to be dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the intersex traits that are common in the
land race gene pools of Asia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, breeding with those can
be a bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, doing mass selections,
phenohunts based on big amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: then putting your your cuttings from
select mothers directly into flower in
[SPEAKER_01]: small plots with a high planting density,
you can turn pretty, pretty fast cycles
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can get really good yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would say if you have the ability
to do so, please attempt to follow this
[SPEAKER_01]: path as it's probably the most
commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, the Indian land races from the
Himalayas, they're going to be somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter than the ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference would be 24 to 20 weeks or
20 to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, if you're somebody who
struggles to maintain the plant's health
[SPEAKER_01]: during long flowering periods,
then maybe you're looking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to shorten that down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find that in the in the cultivars
from higher altitude and from more
[SPEAKER_01]: northerly locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, your your Thai varietals,
your Cambodians, your Laotians are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be depending on, you know, you and your
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen seven meter plants in the
village in Sagaing in Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's your upper limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally, speaking, LST, a lot of
pruning, a lot of cutting back,
[SPEAKER_01]: topping, etc, the techniques that can
benefit you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the ability to let the plants
grow without any sort of topping,
[SPEAKER_01]: they do respond better to these plants are
not used to being individually coddled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're land race plants coming from huge
fields, the farmers do not pay attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to single plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the fields are too far away,
too high up, too remote, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of them will never ever have
been topped before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen that given the intersex
traits being a little bit of an issue for
[SPEAKER_01]: some people, if you have the ability to
not stress them out, then don't stress
[SPEAKER_01]: them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we're saying that in
order to err on the side of caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: My personal experience has been incredibly
resistant, hardy, vigorous, tolerant
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that basically take whatever you
throw at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it funny to contrast that with
the image that a lot of people have is
[SPEAKER_01]: these really finicky and difficult to grow
plants like no, not at all the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're difficult to make them stop
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to you're trying to manage
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's that's a whole different
new different set of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I think a lot of that is from
people trying to bring in stuff that's
[SPEAKER_03]: been acclimated to Thailand outdoors to
indoors, and they just don't get it like
[SPEAKER_03]: they're trying to feed it, you know,
GH nutrients, like just stuffing it full
[SPEAKER_03]: of nutrients and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not what a lot of these land
races want.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't they don't respond well to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it'll make them finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, you know, I think one place
where the cannabis industry is really far
[SPEAKER_01]: behind in regards to in regards to the
wine industry or other or teeth is in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of understanding soil compositions
and minerals, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, you know, clearly fertile,
loamy soil, lots of water that is drawn
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not what we're seeking to
necessarily do, especially with plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that have such a long flowering period.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to reduce the overall cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the wine industry, for example,
we apply such techniques as partial root
[SPEAKER_01]: dehydration, which would be which will
serve to stress the plant in very tactical
[SPEAKER_01]: ways in order to induce specific
physiological changes that we want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant's phytochemical makeup,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or chemical makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as far as that goes with these land
races, you'll find that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in sort of like beautiful,
pristine soils like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we're talking about like for in
Cambodia, a lot of the time, this is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be maybe a bit sad to hear these days,
the grows are no longer next to the Mekong
[SPEAKER_01]: on sort of floodplain areas there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in freshly deforested rainforests,
which is often being deforested for
[SPEAKER_01]: timber, or sometimes specifically for
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that regards, the jungle soils
are often very, very poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Parbati Valley, we see totally degraded
soils from overuse of urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very, very acidic soils on the
bottom of slopes where everything's sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of draining down and accumulating and the
plants are still thriving relatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got different criteria here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're growing 25 acres on a
hillside, it doesn't really matter if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have one or two plants that are a little
bit raggedy looking, especially when no
[SPEAKER_01]: one's ever going to see the flower,
it's going to get rubbed in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit of a different
concern in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way we treat plants in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to these big massive fields is
night and day different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just modeling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cute, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking care of your babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for people that are worried about
intersex traits and stuff, just remember,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're watching this, anything
intersects, like any other trait in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, whether it's purple,
whether it's a scent, it can be bred out
[SPEAKER_03]: or bred in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is something that can be
selected for or selected again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people that are scared of things like
that, it's very easy to work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'd like to offer some perspective
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the land races are going through our
patterns of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including periods of time where many males
are being culled before reverting to total
[SPEAKER_01]: open pollination for a few decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, that'll be enough to bring
out intersex traits in your population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're talking about a hypothetical
land race, which has been growing on a
[SPEAKER_01]: hillside, or maybe that's a bad example,
on a flood plain for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: there will be maybe a little portion of
the field that's raised above the water
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, every, again,
this is totally a hypothetical scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just making up the story here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every, you know, maybe 60 years,
you've got some catastrophic floods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once every cycle of floods,
they happen to kill all the males,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally every single one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant or the population did not
have the intersex traits within it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that population would just disappear
with the flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a survival mechanism that's
found in large cannabis populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just goes hand in hand with land
races, but especially with land races that
[SPEAKER_01]: have gone through periods of intense
cultivation, or which are being grown
[SPEAKER_01]: according to the modern sort of breeding
practices of separating males.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some good context to add to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there any other strange you want to
talk about or get into before we wrap it
[SPEAKER_03]: up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, because I want to be able to point
people to some specific stuff they could
[SPEAKER_03]: check out on your site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there something other than what we've
mentioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we talked about the sort of the
easier to approach ones, which again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that there's, you know,
maybe necessarily a huge difference in the
[SPEAKER_01]: skill curve required.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say that Krung Kravya is
reputed to be, you know, the most potent,
[SPEAKER_01]: the strongest of all the land races grown
in territorial Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a wonderful, it's a wonderful
kind of succession.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see phenotypes that are really,
really resinous with a sort of fermented,
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky, sweet lemon character,
which I'm very personally fond of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of my experiences with
cannabis from Amsterdam in the late 90s
[SPEAKER_01]: with amnesia hazes, which have this sort
of incency, incency kind of lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Krung Kravya expresses itself along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very, very potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows with a pretty unique bud
structure, which I think will take a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of you by surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at it from far away,
it looks like a totally normal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at it close up, it looks a
little bit more like a mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud structure is very loose and open,
and that allows for the UVs to penetrate
[SPEAKER_01]: deep inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rare to find sedative narcotic
cannabis in Southeast Asia due to the long
[SPEAKER_01]: growing period, where the trichomes are
taking a long time to ripen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that on the Krung Kravya,
there's such penetration all the way in
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're seeing quite a high amount of
photo oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you cut it at the right time,
it's got this clear, bright, racy cerebral
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you let it go all the way,
which can be as long as 28 weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll definitely see a lot of really
dark-colored trichomes and a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic sedative effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, I've really enjoyed both
expressions of the Krung Kravya in that
[SPEAKER_01]: regards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, the Thai mango is like
everybody loves mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a delicious fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mango expressions in Asia,
whether that's Mysuru or Thai or Cambodian
[SPEAKER_01]: mango or whatever else, they range from
the green menthol regulated camphor mango
[SPEAKER_01]: through to the more ripe, red,
juicy mangoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people prize different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, if it's called Mamuan,
which is mango in Thai, it's going more
[SPEAKER_01]: for the ripe mango spectrum, as the green
mango is something that's more commonly
[SPEAKER_01]: found across the board in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen a lot, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the red mango that's really valued
and prized.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as that goes, the lowland areas
where mango traditionally was grown and
[SPEAKER_01]: selected are pretty much overrun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have accessions in the north of
the country around Chiang Mai with some
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller growers doing open pollinations in
the sticks, maybe like 80 to 150
[SPEAKER_01]: kilometers outside the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the groups is a Hmong group in
Doi in Penang, the tallest mountain in
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiang Mai.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only is it one of the most
stunningly beautiful places that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: could picture yourself smoking weed from
that place in that place, it's really just
[SPEAKER_01]: heaven on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Thai mango from this terroir,
due to the altitude and the cold
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, which is not that cold in
Thailand, but a few thousand meters,
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand feet, gets a bit nippy,
comes across really purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we used to, back in the day,
sell that as the Thai purple mango and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling out like that every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually just took the purple out of
the name because we wanted people to try
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you probably should check out
the Thai mango if that's your thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you like purple colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we made some selections from
individual black plants in Barbati Valley,
[SPEAKER_01]: namely in Mirang, also in Tosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Tosh is really the two to look out
for, the Shoran and Goy fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really high altitude fields above
the Tosh Kutla.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we saw maybe like one plant in
10 showing any coloration, one plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 showing significant, and then one in a
thousand being like pure black or dark
[SPEAKER_01]: maroon red kind of purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those plants we made selections
from and we separated those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking to phenohunt,
those are going to provide you a slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: better chance than the general population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one specifically is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe I'll just explain to you how
we split up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got the general populations,
which are from, you know, we've asked the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers to basically mix all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually what they do by standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They run plants all the fields and they
sit in their house and a little pile of
[SPEAKER_01]: seed accumulates below them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ask them just to sort through it,
to clean it out, et cetera.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The selections is either us or like
members of our team or the farmers making
[SPEAKER_01]: selections, like a village selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that's just when we've gone there for
two, three days, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going and looking for all the best
plants that we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And putting the seeds aside for those
apart from the general population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the single plant
selections, which you'll see, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Lleudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to figure out an English word for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it should be,
man, but in French it's Lleudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plot is such a clumsy word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very romantic, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to come up with a word for that,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plot selections are obviously
selections made from individual plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as I said before, we're
encouraging the farmers to rub from
[SPEAKER_01]: individual fields and to tell their
customers the name of the fields that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're rubbing from as a way to increase
the value of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're making selections from those
two and then the individual plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for example, it'll be like the
Toshkutla, which is the name of the
[SPEAKER_01]: village.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Shorang, the name of the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the black selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's your single plant selection
from the Goy Garden in Toshkutla.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome to make all of them
available so people actually have a
[SPEAKER_03]: choice, you know, of where they want to
take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, well, well, well, well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subscribers and Patreons get first dibs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about this real quick
because I didn't even know this was a
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and I'm going to join myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went and bought seeds from you before we
ever spoke because I was so stoked about
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the purchases from the site go to
the farmers, which is super important to
[SPEAKER_03]: me and noble as can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I commend you for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Patreon thing, I want to join.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, well, basically the we talked a
lot about incentivizing the communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to do that is to, you know,
as we said, to sell their seeds and to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, you know, given that a lot
of what we do is touching on social
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, ones that, you know, deal a lot
heavily with the class, with race,
[SPEAKER_01]: with colonialism, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And given that there was a need for me as
a foreigner and for a couple of other
[SPEAKER_01]: foreigners to do administrative slash
communication roles, we felt that it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't right to, you know, take a take a
cut out of the seed sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead, what we set up was a
Patreon program and a subscription program
[SPEAKER_01]: on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, during the course of our
work, we, you know, myself personally,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm traveling, I'll, you know,
for example, if I'm accessing the general
[SPEAKER_01]: population, I'm going to go see some,
go see the village and go pick up a
[SPEAKER_01]: restock on the general pop, a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be like maybe along the
way, some uncle who's like, yo,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a few seeds here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's stuff that we can't,
it's not, we, cause we are not in the
[SPEAKER_01]: business of doing reproductions,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we don't get seeds from the hill
tribes or whatever, and then grow them out
[SPEAKER_01]: in banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we almost, you know, I mean,
I, I have my own grow, but I have so many
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, okay, so we're going to get
these seeds, these small quantities,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rarest stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be for, for the nerds,
you know, for the people who are really
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate and who want basically,
you know, hand selected seeds from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from people who are currently and actively
sourcing in the traditional growing
[SPEAKER_01]: regions, you know, hand selected point of
origin seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that allows us to, to draw an
income.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which allows us to do the recruiting work
to bring new groups or communities into
[SPEAKER_01]: the collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, it's working with a lot of
synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe we're not the best at keeping
all the social media up to date,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is probably why a lot of you guys
might not have heard of us until now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we definitely, you know, we,
we hold it down with the seeds and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I feel like everybody involved
is satisfied with the amount of genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're that they're getting from us
where we're doing our best to stand by our
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you know, ultimately doing solid
by the traditional indigenous land race
[SPEAKER_01]: community or growing communities in some
ways, takes bread out of people's mouth in
[SPEAKER_01]: the West.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, you know, we want to be sort of
as, as, as honest and as helpful with
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the West, you know, to give
them, you know, as much of a room at the
[SPEAKER_01]: table as, as we can, you know,
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see this as, as a, a way to form new
connections and new bridges between the
[SPEAKER_01]: communities in different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're so disconnected right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with integration, I think we would all
benefit, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what this is all about in
the end for, for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's why we started the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, it's, you guys are doing
your thing on the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully, you know, we were talking
even more recently about the strain
[SPEAKER_03]: database we're building and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully even we can continue to
collaborate and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've asked you to help with the land
race portion of our strain database that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're building that I'm really super
stoked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there's all kinds of fun
collaborations that we can do and reach
[SPEAKER_03]: out and some of it to some people seems
like eye in the sky stuff, but I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: can accomplish a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for for a little bit of time to
come out of the shadows a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, particular countries like
Indonesia, the rich tradition of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: are very, very, very oppressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not for lack of want,
you know, we, we, you know, people have
[SPEAKER_01]: always wanted to perform these legs and
collaborate, but now time feels right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and so if we can,
you know, help some someone make a name
[SPEAKER_01]: for themselves by beating the next
cannabis cup winner, from Fino hunting,
[SPEAKER_01]: some land race gene pool they access
through us, you know, that would make us
[SPEAKER_01]: happier than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really, we want to lift people up on
everywhere we can.
