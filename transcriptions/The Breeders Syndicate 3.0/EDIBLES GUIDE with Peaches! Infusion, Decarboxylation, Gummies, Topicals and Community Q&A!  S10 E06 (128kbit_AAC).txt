[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_04]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_04]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_04]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our mission is to combat the narrative of
the corporate cannabis industry and seed
[SPEAKER_04]: posers who are obfuscating for their own
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew, here with Thousandfold,
and today we are here with Peaches and
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to be discussing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had Peaches on last season to talk
about extracts in general, and today we
[SPEAKER_02]: have Varan to talk edibles because that is
the other side of what Peaches does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, very excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a lot of demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people asked Peaches on the
server all the time, like how she does
[SPEAKER_02]: this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So naturally, we thought we'd have her on
the show for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we got into it, though,
I just thought it would be cool to break
[SPEAKER_02]: the ice a bit and ask Peaches about how
her outdoor season went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you can talk about it broadly,
Peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went great, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything came off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a staggered harvest from anywhere
from, you know, seven weeks out to the 11
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks for the sour, and it went good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got rained on a little bit,
but nothing got moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most exciting thing for me is I
actually found my Peach turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from all the way through, I had one
Barber Rud Fino that had Peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peach turps, she smelled like it while she
was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: After harvest, she smelled like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that she's been hanging and
carrying, she still smells like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other day I was smoking a joint
and I was like, oh my goodness,
[SPEAKER_01]: it tasted like I ate a Peach fruit cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was shocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to wrap my mind around the fact that
I was not eating a Peach, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking a joint that tasted like Peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love being like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I managed like, I don't know,
we were three weeks from harvest or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe four months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was fully budded when I took the
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so behind and got those clones and
they managed to not only root,
[SPEAKER_01]: but re-veggied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have two fully-veggied plants in
gallon pots ready to go.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe later on we can ask you what edibles
those might go into or what you think
[SPEAKER_02]: might be a good fit for that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of things in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that kind of flavor carry through to
the edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know yet because I've never had
one that had Peach turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that like when we do the,
when I've done the tincture, the glycerin
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture with strawberry banana flower,
it smells like the strawberry banana
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those turps come through all the way
through the cooking process and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, those turps hold strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a lot of turps burn off at
different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll lose them during the edible
making process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I haven't, I haven't tried the
Peach one yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of Peach treats that I
make that it would be interesting to see
[SPEAKER_01]: how they add to all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to see if blue works its way into
an inn like that for flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad Matt that you asked that
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized as soon as I said, you know,
asked about the Peach thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea either about how turps make
their way through that whole process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will, we will be approaching that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe any other highlights Peaches from
your harvest apart from your your Peach
[SPEAKER_02]: plot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the bubble berry from, you know,
Matt did excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really stoked on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all did really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything, you know, it was you water
every day and you put effort into it every
[SPEAKER_01]: day and pluck leaves and do all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just came out really good this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have really good profiles on
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good bud structure and absolutely no mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we got a couple of times of rain
where it just rained and nothing broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had great structure on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was just an overall good year
for the harvest.
Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't always go that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, how's your outdoor harvest going?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just knocked it down all but except the
creamy punch F2s are going to be harvested
[SPEAKER_04]: in two weeks whenever I, whenever it's all
dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have the, what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Flow flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: No F1 Derb Flowrida.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that one in flower and to be
honest, it smells like cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead on, you know, dead on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's, I think I have some
something from professor P out there too,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a Miss Universe that got hit by
the creamy punch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, there's one more creamy punch to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all black purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the only one that went that
extreme black.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't love the turps on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure that I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only one that wasn't extremely
blue smelling out of all those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you repeat that last bit, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you cut out for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the, the, the blackish purple one
was the only one that didn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely blue turps out of the creamy
punch, much more along the silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure if I'm going to even keep
that one, like, or the seeds from it,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm really partial to hard blues
out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely interested to hear more.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you, as you go along.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smuggling the outdoor grow information out
of me evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to kiss you out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: True outdoor grower, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we can get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many opinions on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What comes to mind when you, when you
think of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essential for edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't decarboxylate, you're not
going to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get the same high
because technically THC aid does have
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits and it does things for your
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with pain and inflammation and
stuff like that, but it doesn't create the
[SPEAKER_01]: high that people want when they eat an
edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't do that, decarboxylation
where you convert it mostly over from THC
[SPEAKER_01]: aid to THC, you're going to have a
different effect and people are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: think your edible doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one, I have one little question
here on today and something that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: never really, you know, I'm pretty
ignorant about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try to infuse a bunch of material
without decarboxylation, is there a
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, you're sort of implying that
there might be a function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, because the THC aid is still a
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still can take it and use it,
but it doesn't allow us to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates a different high and then it
works more on your pain receptors than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were going to make yourself a
THC aid tincture, you would just know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to get that same cerebral
high that you would get from one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been decarbed as you would, you know,
that you're just going to get some more
[SPEAKER_01]: pain relief than you would just getting
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like if you had a strain that had
more CBD in it and you didn't decarb it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're still going to be fighting
that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get high because like
when people take edibles, they expect
[SPEAKER_01]: this, you know, body high to get tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that cerebral high as well as just
like, some people get couch locked,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you take it and you don't decarb
it, then you're just, you'll feel
[SPEAKER_01]: something, but you're just not going to
get that locked feeling where you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of THC then, and then that
conversion, what kinds of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, I think in the outline you wrote
temperature and time, like what kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters do you think worked well or
have worked for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep it at 200 degrees for at
least an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use my convection oven to do it,
but you can use your, you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, a double boiler, a regular oven,
whatever you've got to use to warm it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I prefer, I go for 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you go over 200, once you hit the 210
stage, you start to convert it to CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to, you know, keep it as THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to take it over 210.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go with 200 for at least an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's with whether I'm doing flour,
hash, dry sift, rosin, anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like to put their oven on
and then they'll put the flour in there
[SPEAKER_01]: first and like roast the flour to decarb
it before they put it in the oil or into a
[SPEAKER_01]: butter or anything, whatever carrier
they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found that when you do that with
the flour first, it creates kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: roasted flavor, almost like when you vape
flour, you know that, how the old,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like when you vape and you get
your stuff out of the thing, it has that
[SPEAKER_01]: weird popcorn smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do the flour first in the oven,
you're going to get that flavor if you
[SPEAKER_01]: just put that flour and oil in a Mason jar
with the lid on it and put it in the oven,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're still going to decarb that flour,
but you will not have that weird roasted
[SPEAKER_01]: taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just so I'm clear on it, in this
situation, you are decarbing and infusing
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same time, more or less.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even with rosin, I'll put the rosin
in the jar with the oil or whatever you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're going to decarb it
into butter, you know, I don't use a jar
[SPEAKER_01]: for butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole different one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of, yeah, all my decarbing
usually happens during the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: infusing whatever I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because previously I just thought that
there was no of, you know, no difference,
[SPEAKER_02]: quote unquote, between separating the
stages or doing them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's a really good point about
the flavor or, you know, what doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: decarb separately might, you know,
it might have consequences in those ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had another question here, which was,
does your approach change depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of material you are decarbing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like whether it's flour, whether it's an
extract, does anything change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not with the temperature and time,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all going to, you know, because it's
all, you're trying to get that THC to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's the flour you're using or
the concentrate, it all takes the same
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that changes, the only
thing that's different about all those
[SPEAKER_01]: ones is when you use leaf or flour,
you get more of that weed taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, yeah, well, yeah,
that's because people, I think people have
[SPEAKER_02]: asked you before I've seen them asking you
like, how do you, how do you minimize
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this was one of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was one of the questions from
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just over the last day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they posted about it in the.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it using hash or rosin makes
the least weedy hash and rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more spicy than it is that weed
flavor because I can't stand the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I make me gag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it makes everything way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's times when I'm like out of
habit, you know, you cook stuff and I try
[SPEAKER_01]: to taste things to make sure they taste
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm making brownies or a cake or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I'll go to taste the
brownie, but, and then I regret it
[SPEAKER_01]: immensely every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is quite random, but do you remember
me and Matt talking to you about pandan,
[SPEAKER_02]: that leaf from Southeast Asia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weirdly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that kind of aroma would actually
work really well with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to try actually now that I'm
saying I might have to go and try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's that's more on the side of
like vanilla coconut already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those flavors might might actually kind of
work with with the flavor of.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already green as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry, but total attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this, I do want to ask Matt as well,
another tangent.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much edibles have you made?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how much experience do you have like
making stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it like three times total.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a machine we bought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposed to be all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the idea?
[SPEAKER_04]: The purple one?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's this little machine that decarbs
it for you and makes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We never used it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've only done it a few times and
the way I decarbs in the oven.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've made awful, awful, awful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd let it burn up and.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not good, not good at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really stunk up the house, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the other hard part was how much
it stinks up the house when you do it
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it stink that bad when you do it
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: It stinks no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just that it's that smell it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you put it in a jar with the lid
on it, you still get some smell.
Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, weirdly, it's the smell of it
puts me off more, especially if I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, like if I'm sitting with it all
day, then it does start to get to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a lot for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so was there anything else about
decarboxylation that you want to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about peaches?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that covers it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it's really a simple process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I think sometimes people forget
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people think that rosin is
already decarbed because you press it at a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher temp, but it's not on there long
enough for it to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important that if you are making
edibles that you take the time to do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: because otherwise you're going to you're
going to be sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think something that you did say
that I'll just repeat or highlight again,
[SPEAKER_02]: the different cannabinoids do actually
have different points at which they
[SPEAKER_02]: convert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I think you mentioned CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it lower or is it higher?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure about the exact temperature
of when it converts to CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to look that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that at 210 is when THC starts
to convert.
[SPEAKER_01]: To CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one that gets the red color
and it makes you more tired than anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that's that's what you get
when you like, you know, a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people will do they already have a butt,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of CBN, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like older weed that's been around,
like sitting around for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains higher levels of the CBN
because it's a switched and it's converted
[SPEAKER_01]: over time and oxidization.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, the next interesting topic is
actually going to be carriers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is this is interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different fats or different oils have
different capacities to absorb or hold the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peaches, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you have to say on this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when you're going to make edibles,
you want to use something that contains
[SPEAKER_01]: fat as your either fat or alcohol,
because you need that fat to help
[SPEAKER_01]: transport it into your system when you
digest it and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of what happens in your body
is that it latches onto that fat molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: and that allows it to be absorbed and
taken into your liver where it's processed
[SPEAKER_01]: and allows you to actually get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to use a butter a milk,
a cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can use the MCT oil because
it's a medium chain triglyceride,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it makes it easy for you to absorb
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it a little quick,
more quickly bioavailable to your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we all know alcohol absorbs THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's you know, like, well,
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, now the whole conflict
between RSO and FICO, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody makes RSO with NAPSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I'm aware of anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Rick Simpson, I'm pretty sure made
his with grain alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what people had access
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I a lot of times refer to it as RSO and
have to be told, well, no, you don't make
[SPEAKER_01]: it with NAPSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make it with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's considered FICO, which is full
extract cannabis oil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we have to be terminology
correct sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned that some of what
distinguishes these carriers are like the
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity to hold in store, you know,
the cannabinoids and then also the way in
[SPEAKER_02]: which they make those cannabinoids
available to your system once even this
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you use the different ones for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you use do you use like a range of
them or do you have you kind of gravitated
[SPEAKER_02]: towards a couple of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it matter when your application?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have different ones that I prefer for
certain ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I'm going to make a tincture,
I love to use the MCT oil because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: just it's a great carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the milk or cream works great if
you want to make flavored coffee,
[SPEAKER_01]: ice cream, puddings, you know,
anything that contains milk that you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have to try to substitute oil in
for, you know, because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, make oil and then they
will substitute it in for something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that for your basic cookie recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brownies work great with the oil because
you always put oil on brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every brownie recipe calls for
like a third cup of oil as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not adding anything extra to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now when you want to do
chocolate, a lot of people like to put the
[SPEAKER_01]: butter into chocolate, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a great ganache with
chocolate and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But butter in chocolate will cause it to
expire faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I recommend using cocoa
butter if you're going to infuse chocolate
[SPEAKER_01]: or a coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people have coconut allergies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when you want to look into if
you've got somebody with a coconut
[SPEAKER_01]: allergy, you can use avocado oil and then
you can use the cocoa butter also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes into the chocolate and
you're not adding anything to the
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate to make it different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chocolate already is cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people forget about cocoa
butter a little bit because it's a solid
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have to melt, but it still will
infuse and works great to put into
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then butter you can cook with on the
stove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avocado oil, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you infuse it, you can use it to
dress your salad, make a salad dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Season your vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on how you want to consume
it or eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else about making your choice
about which carrier beyond what you've
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned already?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else that comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would have to say that,
in my opinion, butter has the strongest
[SPEAKER_01]: taste out of all the carriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes the longest to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you end up with more of that
weed flavor in the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to stay away from
that, that might not be something you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to make and use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I will say that in my personal
experience, that is the one that has the
[SPEAKER_02]: greatest tendency to make me just feel
quite grossed out just by being around it
[SPEAKER_02]: all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's butter and weed for sure because it's
already so rich on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, when you're heating it up,
combining it with the musk of cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: just full on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more of a tangent because I know
this is an Edibles episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were making a topical,
what kind of base would you use for a
[SPEAKER_02]: topical?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use a mixture of shea butter and
mango butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 mix of those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also use a with those two
butters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a jojoba oil and MCT oil and then
glycerin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I use vitamin E as a
preservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was I was fully considering making
some for my girlfriend for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got like a sore neck and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I might have to wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to follow up on this with you
and get a bit more info.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm down to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe another episode too,
unlike topicals perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you'd like, I'll send you my
recipe, the actual breakdown of the
[SPEAKER_01]: weights and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes out really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it down to where it's more of a
cream type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whipped cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you'd like, I'll send that to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get high off it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my girlfriend does not like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it and I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had anybody tell me they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have a lady who used one of my bath
teas and salts and fell asleep in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bathtub because she got so relaxed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because she didn't drown?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, she didn't drown, but she fell asleep
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her husband had to come find her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is making me want to like make
some topical cream and try rubbing it on
[SPEAKER_02]: like the inside and stuff to see if it
will get in me anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that it's like a localized thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you rub it on your arm, most of it will
not get into your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it would take a lot to
actually get all the way into your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know they do not make those topical
cannabis patches now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it has to get into there to some
extent, but I don't think it's in there
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to like if it was like eating an
edible where you'd be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, I'm high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she would be really mad if I gave
it to her and then she got high off it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she'd be pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've missed the window to make it
for Christmas, but I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For another time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Valentine's is coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're happy with the carriers,
you had another point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did already touch on it, but did you
want to go into the glycerin tincture
[SPEAKER_02]: again in more detail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can do that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you use this for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've never really myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never really heard of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Glycerin is awesome because glycerin is
water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can also and you can use it as
a topical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a humectant for your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps keep the moisture in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I use it in the lotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also it doesn't affect your the
insulin as much as sugars do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some research they did about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cool thing about the glycerin is
like you can use it like I like to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: to make gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer it to make gummies way more than
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil to make gummies is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glycerin makes great gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix it with just rubbing alcohol
and use it as a topical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can drink it straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it in your coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it in your soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it in anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can drink it straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what was, you know, awesome
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we chose a organic vegetable
glycerin and we first did this recipe when
[SPEAKER_01]: Buckshot was on fentanyl, Soma,
Celebrex, Lyrica, all those gnarly drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: they had him on for his back pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he went to get off those,
we developed this glycerin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a lot of people think with
the glycerin, you either do it like you
[SPEAKER_01]: would do a normal decarb or you have to
let it sit for six months, which is one
[SPEAKER_01]: way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody wants to wait around for six
months to a year for your stuff to infuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had some research.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the that he had done, and it was
Skunk Farms put out a article about how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do the glycerin tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of learning how to make all
this is that that's how he figured out how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do the formula so that you can actually
extract the THC into the glycerin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our ratio is you get a gallon of
glycerin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use anywhere from four to six
ounces of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends like, you know,
if you have big buds that are bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're going to want to use four
ounces per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have the smaller ones,
you can get away with six.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important that glycerin pours way
better when it's warmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you warm it up before you pour it
over the flour, it works better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I use is it's a little induction
burner thing, you know, only works with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain pans and you put it on there and
you set it to run at 190 to 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to be going over 200 and
you run it on the heat for four hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you pull it off and you put it into
an ice bath to cool it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have ice or you don't
want to buy the ice, you can let it sit at
[SPEAKER_01]: room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it cools down to room temp,
you put it back on and you heat it up for
[SPEAKER_01]: four hours again and you repeat that
process six times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that time, you keep stirring it
frequently so it doesn't burn to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, making it kind of like when
you're washing hash, you're forcing the
[SPEAKER_01]: glycerin to go through the buds and,
you know, absorb through and pick up all
[SPEAKER_01]: the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you do that for six times of
warming and cooling and then you strain
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found some nut bags for making nut milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like 200 micron and a couple other
180, I think, micron and 100 micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you use those and you strain it
through and you've got glycerin that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could put in your bathtub because it's
water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could take a bath where the THC
actually goes into the water and doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: float as oil on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've actually had it tested and it
tested to where we got a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of THC per ounce of glycerin at
that ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so it makes good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can put that right into a drink
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, or like those sparkling
waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also put it in just a bottle and I'll
flavor it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Lorans has some great candy
flavorings that you can put into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got a watermelon flavored
tincture or cherry or grape or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to be really clear here,
do you ever use it alongside a carrier
[SPEAKER_02]: oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or no, it's instead of most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it with oil when I make my topicals
because my topicals have an oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: glycerin in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like to use both of those
medicated into the batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, it's like you were saying,
because I guess the ultimate product is
[SPEAKER_02]: like a water-based thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to use glycerin for that
instead of the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I get you now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for telling us about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'd ever heard of,
yeah, that's a new one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pretty awesome product to
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen it used any other ways that
you came to try out yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a saltwater taffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use glycerin to make saltwater taffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just haven't had the time to make it
from scratch yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one thing I haven't made yet
that I've been interested in trying it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need a taffy puller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got one of those laying
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anything else about glycerin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise we can move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that's it on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if you're going to, a lot of times,
it's not only like when you, if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to press the, like if you use the flour to
press the flour to get the glycerin out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use a wine press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, I did have to use a
potato ricer because I didn't have a wine
[SPEAKER_01]: press.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the two pieces of equipment
that come in handy when you want to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, extract anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're using oil even,
or even if it's glycerin, oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: butter, and you want to strain your leaf
out and squish it so it comes out,
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend a potato ricer or a wine
press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent info.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about sunflower lecithin, or however
you say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never questioned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just read about it early on and it
seemed to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never tried it without.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's the whole thing that helps
you uptake the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that part of it that it makes it
more bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps it carry into your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing about it is that is the
key.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make gummies with oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me pause you here because what
you said was already something that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: quite interested in, which is at least the
initial point, which was, have you,
[SPEAKER_02]: have you side by side tried an edible with
and without?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, have you seen the difference in
uptake because for me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, typically you hear people making
edibles, especially back in the day when
[SPEAKER_02]: we were just baking brownies and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would say that it took ages to kick
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I, when I have used lecithin,
I feel like it's, it kicks in really
[SPEAKER_02]: quick, but that's just anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like have you seen, you know, yourself
this effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly, I haven't experimented with
myself because the only time I use it is
[SPEAKER_01]: when I make gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, I'll experiment on buckshot
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like poor buckshot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just making jokes at buckshot's
expense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, gummies with gummies with lesser than
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, cause it, the, not only does it
help with the high, but it, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to use oil to make gummies,
you need an emulsifier or you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a horrible mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh my God, I've had horrible
experiences with the oil and the gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I see the oil just like starts
leaking out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't do it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reaches out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will leach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not only do you lose that and then
they like to mold easier, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I found, uh, they sell it in
liquid and powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only worked with the liquid,
but I did find out a key with the liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: sunflower was that I had to let it bloom
in the water, like gelatin before I used
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause otherwise sometimes it would clump
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a couple of times to figure it
out, but if you let it bloom, the liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom, um, then you don't have that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I use it when I made,
uh, I prefer to make, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: my gummies with glycerin, but there's
times when I've had to use oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sometimes I've had to use alcohol just
cause that's what I've had on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sunflower lecithin helps with,
uh, the oil one immensely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to make one with oil the other
day and they came out perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't even tell they were any
different than the ones I made with
[SPEAKER_01]: glycerin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, because for me, like I usually
just make a big batch of oil at the start
[SPEAKER_02]: of the year, you know, every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just historically have always used
lecithin and, um, yeah, it seems to,
[SPEAKER_02]: it seems to be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me, let us know if you get to
experiment with buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anything else about that, that
additive?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good tip for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, you can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to just use it in the
gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like, you use it in your oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it in anything to help with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's supposed to be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, if you eat mango,
it helps enhance the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is a good one for people to
go try, uh, comment down below if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: tried lecithin and if you've, especially
if you've gotten to do a side by side of
[SPEAKER_02]: some kind, I'm definitely curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had a point here about making full
spectrum oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of talked about it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything to add features to,
um, if you're going to be making that,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can afford it and get it,
um, I like to use, uh, it's by extract a
[SPEAKER_01]: hall and it's 190 proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's sugar cane made from sugar cane
and it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I know everybody has different
budgets and stuff, but the higher proof
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use the better because then you're
getting a better extraction of just the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and less of the chlorophyll and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other thing when making it,
uh, the longer you let it soak,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more chlorophyll you're going to have
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you actually, alcohol works very quick
at, uh, dissolving THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to let it, um,
sit for hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut out for a little bit in the middle
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say that again?
[SPEAKER_02]: That last sentence?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, that, uh, the longer you let the
cannabis sit in the, uh, alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more chlorophyll you're going to get
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the alcohol is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very effective at dissolving THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it doesn't have to sit in there for
hours at a time just to get the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can just be, I think like the minimum
is five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you'll have your extract and then
you can, you know, strain and get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that stuff is supposed to be dabble
bull.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a five minutes extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I like to do it, let it sit for,
you know, 15 minutes to an hour in the
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol and then strain it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other thing with making it is you
can do, uh, what we term as stacking a
[SPEAKER_01]: batch, which is where you put your four to
six ounces of weed into a gallon of
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You soak it, let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You strain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add another four to six
ounces of weed to that same alcohol and
[SPEAKER_01]: you let it sit and extract it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you strain it and go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get a stacked batch because
you can't put 12 ounces of flour into one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much your ratios off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do it in a stacked batch,
you could get a stronger batch and not
[SPEAKER_01]: have to use as much alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also make sure when you're making it,
you use a thermometer to keep track of
[SPEAKER_01]: your temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you don't want it going above the 200
mark, uh, all the same conversion stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like with decarbon all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then you don't want it to burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, uh, same thing using,
uh, the wine press to get it all out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the material and the net bags to strain
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I even, there's even, we even use
those, uh, gold coffee filters as a double
[SPEAKER_01]: strainer on top of the nut bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I don't know, five times
filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that the bottom is the 25U screens
underneath the net bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll get some very,
very clean, um, full extract cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_01]: from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be, uh, at about, I would say
80% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at that ratio, if you make it like
that, that means like for every gram you
[SPEAKER_01]: have an estimate of 80% of that gram is
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're making an edible and you
use one gram of that FECO, you can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, well that's 800 milligrams in that
batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, yeah, I kind of, one of,
one of the sections in here that we wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk, speak to was dosing and potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, was there anything else to add to the
extract oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise I thought maybe that's a good
segue into talking about like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how, how you measure or
estimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the perfect way to send me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, we end this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to thank, uh, Peach first and
foremost for coming on and we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have her again next week for part two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, wanted to thank thousand of course,
for always showing up and always arranging
[SPEAKER_04]: these shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we have some real nice ones in the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, other than that, check out our
Patreon and discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we hang out there every day and it's,
it's a family.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty, pretty freaking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we nerd out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We watch events together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do all kinds of stuff together and,
uh, you save 30% on riot seeds and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, and, uh, goat farm gear too.
