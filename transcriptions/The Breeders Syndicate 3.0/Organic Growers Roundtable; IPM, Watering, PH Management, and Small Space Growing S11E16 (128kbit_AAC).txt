[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I can talk a little bit about what
I've done the last two years, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: a little more in depth, but, uh,
I generally run and build a soil soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here in Colorado, at least they've
been relatively cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I do try to re-amend all my pods after
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I throw, I break everything down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I throw it back into the build a soil bag
and I literally just layer with amendments
[SPEAKER_04]: and I would just leave them on my balcony
for months until I needed more soil and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd go right back to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but for when I was actually
transplanting into pots and one gallons,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I was trying to pack enough food into
heavier feeders, I would do something like
[SPEAKER_04]: fill up the pot, maybe a third of the way,
just so it's open and easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would slowly add a handful of
worm castings, um, usually around a cup
[SPEAKER_04]: ish of worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll do a cup of compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: A cup, a pinch of something like Kashi
blend or, um, a lighter, quicker release
[SPEAKER_04]: amendment mix, just something to kind of
give it a little bit boost of immediate
[SPEAKER_04]: food within the actual media.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll go a little bit more soil
and then another cup of compost,
[SPEAKER_04]: another cup of worm castings and kind of
just slowly mix it all together within the
[SPEAKER_04]: pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then create my whole and transplant
directly from clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that would usually fill up my,
I ran the plastic one gallon bags,
[SPEAKER_04]: just the cheapy ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't like air pruning pots or
fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've found that they, um, are really good
homes for fungus gnats or a root aphids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of those really suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would highly advise against those,
but, um, that's just an off my anecdotal
[SPEAKER_04]: experience, but, uh, I would allow the pot
to, or the plant to essentially root up
[SPEAKER_04]: within that three quarters of a full bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the top dress, I would literally
unfold the top of the bag and I would just
[SPEAKER_04]: dump more worm castings and another pinch
of Kashi blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'd throw some more soil on top
and kind of just work it in with my
[SPEAKER_04]: fingers, give it a light pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would more often than not,
there was, I think I found maybe two or
[SPEAKER_04]: three plants in two years that wanted a
lot more food than what was in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything else pretty much allowed me to
write it out with, uh, that like a more
[SPEAKER_04]: than content amount of food for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I, it will kind of sacrifice yield
going on, going that way, but that is the
[SPEAKER_04]: least of my selection pressures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm entirely focused on the high of
the plant and the flavor of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want it to taste good and I want to
enjoy the effect of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't taste good and it doesn't,
and it doesn't give me a good high,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care how much it produces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yield for me is not something
that's built into something that I need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within that way of growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it allowed me to get a really good
base level of each, you know, that I ran
[SPEAKER_04]: through in that time and gave me a really
good idea of like, okay, I know I need for
[SPEAKER_04]: this specific, you know, it needs more
food at this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it'll start yellowing on me
early, or it'll give me a weird color
[SPEAKER_04]: fade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that that can kind of refer to
like maybe a phosphorus issue or a
[SPEAKER_04]: calcium, anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those, my kind of factors,
but for me personally, when I'm growing in
[SPEAKER_04]: those pots, that's kind of the general
system I've roughly developed for myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carl, any thoughts on, you know,
containers, different sizes, different
[SPEAKER_05]: approaches, smaller containers,
larger containers, beds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, because I pretty much went over
that earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, does it, I only do the one
gallons and, you know, I used to do the
[SPEAKER_06]: two gallons, but it was just taking up too
much room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, yeah, I've done one gallons.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm able to just, I'm able to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm able to get it through, uh,
even, you know, uh, man, I've kind of,
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gone pretty, pretty long in one
gallons, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I talked about, I think I talked
about that last time I had an Isaac Hayes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that thing just kept going and
going and going in a one gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, it was, it was, it was past
120 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, easily.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just never ran out of whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just don't, I never understood it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's nothing really too much to add.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Bumke, any, any other prompts from
this topic of like pot sizes and stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can kind of do like a rough little
treatise on like beds versus bigger pots
[SPEAKER_04]: and smaller pots from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it'll, it seems that beds are the most
convenient and are like the most
[SPEAKER_04]: convenient in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because it's kind of like a set it and
forget it for the most part minus the
[SPEAKER_04]: occasional top dressing and amending that
it needs to go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: In between or in the flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but my one issue that I do have with
beds is that if you do get any sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: soil burn pathogen, you're essentially
screwed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, like if you're running a bed and
something like Fusarium gets into it,
[SPEAKER_04]: like just horrible luck, but I don't
necessarily know if there's a way that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can save that from infecting everything
else that's within that same media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, obviously that would have to be done
from like a clone coming in somewhere else
[SPEAKER_04]: or you contracting it from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, um, larger pots, I feel would be
like the most ideal way to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: organically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously they take up a lot more space
and they're a little bit better for bigger
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so if you're confined to space,
that's the one issue with larger pots,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I feel it's the closest thing to a
bed, but it still allows you to have
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: That you're taking care of rather than one
large bed that has everything in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, smaller pots are very much doable,
but it breaks a lot of the traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: organic system methodologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that largely comes back to just
being conscious of like plant size going
[SPEAKER_04]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, you wouldn't want to
flower a plant that's 30 something inches
[SPEAKER_04]: tall, like close to a meter high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go over very well because at week three or
four, that plant's going to be done with
[SPEAKER_04]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's a big stretcher, you're going
to have a five, six foot plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going dry every five to six hours
because it has to drink that much water to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep itself alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your media just can't contain that
much water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, um, there's different ways
to do it for different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can do like the small pot with
smaller plants and you can run like a
[SPEAKER_04]: larger amount of feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's in a smaller space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you have the space and that's not
an issue and you're kind of just looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for more ease of growth, like water only
type of method, I would recommend like a
[SPEAKER_04]: larger pot or even the two by four beds
like screws and is doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great way to do, even if you
wanted to do a couple of larger plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could do three, maybe four couple foot
plants easily in that space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so it's kind of the different ways
that you can go about it within the
[SPEAKER_04]: different pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you can do a pretty big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I usually try and do though,
is flip them small so that I can pack in
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause I'm, I'm looking for stuff,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think to me one, obviously one high
level reflection that I have on all of
[SPEAKER_05]: this is obviously they're trade-offs with
every, every approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they're different risks with the
different containers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and okay, this is not in the outline
at all, but I thought I would ask you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys, like what had been some,
speaking of risks, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: What if, what are some things that have
gone wrong for you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as like a little break from the,
you know, the other topics, like what are
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the major like fuck ups that have
occurred or not fuck ups necessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's not always your fault,
but yeah, what are some of the biggest
[SPEAKER_05]: disasters you guys have encountered?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, my first run in a two by four,
I had two 20 gallon pots in there with two
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put the seeds in the pot and literally
started that plants at 1212.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I overwatered one of them on like,
I want to say something like Dave 20
[SPEAKER_04]: something when the plant was like eight
inches tall and it just fell over and like
[SPEAKER_04]: literally went wet, limp, wet noodle on
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so that run I yielded a total of
six grams from my other 10 inch lollipop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, no, you can definitely kill
things real quick if you're not paying
[SPEAKER_04]: attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carlos, Kristen, any, any fun disasters to
tell us about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, mine, I pretty much talked about
last time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty much that Isaac case where I
think it was pretty much the heat,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I'm kind of dealing with now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's doing a Fox tail thing
because, uh, since I'm a night grower,
[SPEAKER_06]: my plants don't get time to cool down.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are basically growing all the time
because during the day it's obviously hot
[SPEAKER_06]: and, uh, I can't cool it down because I'm
in the garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, you know, it's, um, it's,
uh, something I deal around.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just looks because in TLO anyway,
my plants are not going to look like
[SPEAKER_06]: anything in any other organic system or
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I have to always remember that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: My stuff definitely is, won't look like
other people's when they finish all that
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, but every, but pretty much I've
dealt with all the little problems that
[SPEAKER_06]: have come along, you know, over watering,
under watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, mostly I deal with a lot of potassium
because obviously with the heat,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, my plants are, uh, is earning a lot
of, um, uh, moisture and stuff during
[SPEAKER_06]: their nighttime.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am constantly dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but I don't ever try to goose them or,
you know, put extra stuff in them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause then that'll obviously mess stuff
up, especially, uh, during the second half
[SPEAKER_06]: of flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, cause from what I understand,
especially phosphorus, the plant holds it
[SPEAKER_06]: for about 20 days or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I never do anything, do the second half
of flower or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, I think that's about,
that's pretty, pretty much the only major
[SPEAKER_06]: one that I've had.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I've had bugs and stuff like that from
maybe the compost, but that was mostly
[SPEAKER_06]: when I was in my apartment, when I was
first starting out and that was only for
[SPEAKER_06]: like six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I had all the fungus gnats and stuff,
cause I was trying to do the compost
[SPEAKER_06]: inside and yeah, that's fun trying to get
rid of all those in an apartment when you
[SPEAKER_06]: had to worry about inspections and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, that was a fun, fun, fun learning
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily I could just take a ride outside
my, uh, my front door and everything
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually went away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I eventually, I eventually figured it
out and, uh, yeah, luckily we got a house
[SPEAKER_06]: and so, but, uh, yeah, I just kind of deal
with stuff as it comes up, but I got the
[SPEAKER_06]: basic problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bugs come up and, you know, you just deal
with them and with my IPM or whatever I
[SPEAKER_06]: do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, that's basically it for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I got a couple of mess ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, first, first, first round in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, I, I flower in two by fours
because when I first started, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing again, I was also in an apartment
and I had to do it all in the two by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, I don't know, I guess I
realized that plants don't really drink
[SPEAKER_00]: much towards the end of flowering,
uh, because I watered in six gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was because they were just raging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watered it in and it completely
destroyed that carpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, also, um, you know, uh,
the little isopods, those little pill
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, yeah, they're beneficial to an
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get to a high enough population,
they start eating your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like chewing them down, like they're like
they're beavers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had that problem, uh, for quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you end up running into that,
just use a beer trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fastest way to just knock them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I mean, I guess the mind,
the mice and throat issue that I got from
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone that I've received,
uh, you know, that kind of fucked my shit
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause I wasn't able to flower for
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fighting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that's really system,
uh, system dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely, I guess it is a lot harder
though, because, you know, with thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that those, you know,
um, like infect soil and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they, they, oh, I was going to say,
yes, I know a lot of people don't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: they will hibernate in soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause actually I get them once it starts
to heat up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so I deal with that every,
every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to use a, bring out the spinosad
and, um, yeah, but they, they will
[SPEAKER_06]: hibernate in soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to kind of dig in the research
surprisingly for that, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I found that out that they will do that
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's from people also over the years
finding out that they get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly when it's the heat,
once it starts to heat up, they come out
[SPEAKER_06]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will point out that I guess being,
you know, having a large bed, it kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: goes back to what Bobcat was saying,
I think, or at least alluding to,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is that it's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much harder for you to like separate,
you know, quarantine individuals from each
[SPEAKER_05]: other, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're all in the one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're one system, essentially one
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely a big drawback to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, like when you're,
when you're leaving it in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people just leave their,
they'll just cut the base of their plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and like leave the root ball and all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over years you're, you're asking for,
um, those, uh, root nematodes and shit to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more victims, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I, I have to, I water in,
um, predatory nematodes every month,
[SPEAKER_00]: about every four or five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I water them in just to try and,
you know, have a chance at it at,
[SPEAKER_00]: at keeping that at bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I might switch over to just
replacing my soil every three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that seems to be the point where
it's still just rocking and not not
[SPEAKER_00]: having, I'm not having to deal with too
much, you know, Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this might be a, I feel like
this might be a good time to slide into
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe a little bit of IPM tips and tricks
for organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kick it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I use a couple of different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was given a bottle of Pyganic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a insecticide and fungicide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not necessarily organic,
but that shit really helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, like almost prohibitively expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it really does help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you're having like any type of
insect, like insect, soft body insect
[SPEAKER_04]: problems or like major fungus issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not entirely sure about root,
like drenching it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but for any like powdery mildew or
anything that's actually eating the bio,
[SPEAKER_04]: like biomass of the plant that goes a
really long way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, otherwise I honestly got my IPM recipe
that I've been using for years now from,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the, one of the episodes on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, it's essentially just,
uh, Dr. Bronner's mint soap, the,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, at one ounce per gallon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you're really like dealing with
something on your leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would recommend maybe doing two ounces
per gallon, but definitely make sure those
[SPEAKER_04]: plants are dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you throw them back under the
lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the mint will absolutely destroy your
leaves if you put light on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned that lesson as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, also doing something like one ounce
per gallon of isopropyl 99% isopropyl or,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, 3% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super great for killing any sort of
powdery mildew problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a couple of days back to back in a row
of the mixture of the two should pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: much cure any issue with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the Dr. Bronner's Bastille soap is
super great for any type of, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: soft body insect that you want to get rid
of in your actual media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they breathe through pores on their
sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it essentially does the same kind of
thing as, um, like a horticultural oil
[SPEAKER_04]: where it, when you get it wet and you foam
it up and you shake it and then you spray
[SPEAKER_04]: it into your, uh, or pour it into your,
um, soil, it will cause essentially an oil
[SPEAKER_04]: coating to go over those pores and the
insects immediately suffocate and die.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the same, um, mode of action in
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you can also do things like,
um, a saponite extract from something like
[SPEAKER_04]: soap nuts for like a really good,
um, foliar to help aid with just any type
[SPEAKER_04]: of, um, uh, like mildew or PM type issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's all sorts of other ones I can
get into, but I'll let the other two
[SPEAKER_04]: start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, guys, IPM, but I mean, it's
Christian already touched on his,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, basically the only thing I really do
is I use a double death nematodes from,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, nature's control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I use that in my soil, uh,
every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called, uh, they're called,
uh, double death nematodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it double death.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what, so yeah, it definitely takes
out everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You won't see anything, uh, flying around.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're moving around for a little while
and the plants, uh, actually enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually see them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they perk up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I've always used those because
obviously, like I said, I found out that
[SPEAKER_06]: the thrips, they will stay in the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I definitely, I do use that every maybe
60 days or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you're supposed to be able to use that
as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never used that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I don't really do any of that stuff,
um, except when I do see, if I do start to
[SPEAKER_06]: get to see the thrips, cause something
happened or they came in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just use the spinosad and, um,
I use, uh, I mulch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't really have to like cover my
soil or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and I just take, take them in the
bathtub and spray them until they're dry
[SPEAKER_06]: and then put them back in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I really don't have too much of an IPM
cause, uh, I mean, bugs are normal for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't see bugs, then something's
going not, not right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they, technically it is living.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause so, so if I don't see a bunch of
stuff, uh, as long as it's not,
[SPEAKER_06]: not on the plants, uh, there are micro
micro BCs as well, you know, how we think
[SPEAKER_06]: of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, yeah, you know, I kind of want to
see living stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got a couple more tips and tricks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought of, um, diatomaceous earth,
super, super helpful with like anything
[SPEAKER_04]: that you want to essentially like a
overpopulation of anything in your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I would imagine it's probably really
good for something like a root aphids or
[SPEAKER_04]: even fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've seen it work wonders personally
on fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, also a mustard seed meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I was very skeptical when I first came
across this, but I found a white paper a
[SPEAKER_04]: while back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to dig in and see if I can find
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that essentially said, uh,
it was the first time I've ever seen this
[SPEAKER_04]: term, but bio fumigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, essentially what happens is when you
put the actual mustard seed meal onto the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil and you get it wet, what happens is
the actual fumigation process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the top couple inches, which is
where the majority of your issues will
[SPEAKER_04]: reside.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's an overpopulation of any type,
we'll essentially get fumigated out by
[SPEAKER_04]: poisonous mustard gas that's released once
it gets wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've done it a couple of times when
I've had a fungus gnats issue in flower,
[SPEAKER_04]: like just a light sprinkle of like a
teaspoon or so on my soil, get it wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually within two or three days,
it's pretty much 90% knocked out,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever the problem is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that one worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's super, super helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I had one more, but I lost it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there was, and I don't know if you,
you, you want to move yet Bumcat,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, uh, I saw that there was also mention
of pH management.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, was that, was that something you want
to get into?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can talk on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so we can do like different
perspectives on pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, for me personally, I don't whatsoever
at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've never owned one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you need one to grow good at
weed in soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I do think they can only help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the reasons I don't pH anything is
because first of all, those meters are
[SPEAKER_04]: damn expensive and they are not made the
last.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things break so easy and they are
not cheap to replace at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's the first reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second, the second major
reason is that if you're looking at the
[SPEAKER_04]: theory, theoretically your, if you have a
healthy organic system, the media should
[SPEAKER_04]: itself should act as a pH buffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not like when you're feeding in
an organic system, you're feeding more so
[SPEAKER_04]: the fun, like the fungus in the bacteria
than anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what's facilitating that
exchange of food within the media.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't necessarily need to moderate
the pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the microbes themselves in their
natural populations and the fungus or the
[SPEAKER_04]: fungal network within that media are
actually what exchange the pH back and
[SPEAKER_04]: forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I've, I've w I brought home a pH
meter from work one day just out of
[SPEAKER_04]: curiosity to test what my watering can
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I just have one of those cheapy weed
sprayers from the Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's like a $10 pump sprayer kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dipped the pH meter in there and it was
reading like 3.7.
[SPEAKER_04]: I watered it in that night and I came back
and everything was praying just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have any issues whatsoever with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like off anecdotal experience and
myself, I've never seen a necessity to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a pH meter if you're growing in like
a organic system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thoughts from the other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just about the whole pH,
um, in your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in a, in like a proper, you know,
the type of potting soil that we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that pH isn't even constant
throughout the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it alters based on, you know,
what micro population is there in like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, within the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even, I don't know, even just given it,
um, as long as your pH is relatively fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which most people have normal water coming
out of their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you should be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're curious about that water
tests are actually pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pretty much find them locally,
wherever you are, at least here in the U S
[SPEAKER_04]: can't speak about Kiwis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, you can get that tested
super easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can pretty much send it off anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of places that do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just pop in Google and it'll come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that'll give you like a full
breakdown of what's actually in your water
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out of your faucet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you need to do anything,
um, in the U S a lot of taps, a lot of tap
[SPEAKER_04]: systems run a small amount of chlorine in
there to prevent, uh, any type of,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, buildup within pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, if I ever ran something out of the
faucet, I'd make sure I'd put it through
[SPEAKER_04]: something like a Brita filter or just a
really simple, like one stage water filter
[SPEAKER_04]: to try and get as much of that out as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be absolutely perfect,
but it'll definitely help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can let it sit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's regular chlorine, it'll dissipate
over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think just randomly, but where I am,
you can actually get reports.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I think the reports online from like
your local council, whatever water people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and they tell you like, since they
last test and monitoring, like what,
[SPEAKER_05]: how much of what is in the water,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it is here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do it like quarterly or
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, anything else on this topic,
Bumcat?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that kind of covers that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for, for what I use for pH is this
dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I try to get mine about a seven,
7.0, which is neutral.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I believe that that's basically what
most cannabis likes, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: what I've at least found.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I, I pH, I did have a meter in the
very beginning when I made my very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very first batch of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was exactly what, uh, was in the
book.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was after that, I never use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually the thing just broke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know what happened to
whatever that is fancy.
[SPEAKER_06]: The blue lab pen was, it was fancy after a
while I looked at it and I was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the thing's broke anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know I, and I've never used one,
but, uh, I use fast acting dolomite lime
[SPEAKER_06]: in my water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I send it through a filter,
a tap through a filter first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, then I build my water up with a
fast acting dolomite lime for two,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, get it to 7.0 basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then obviously I have stuff in my
soil that buffers it to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I have more dolomite lime in the
soil and that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say, um, I've heard Tad Hussey from
Kiss Organics who he has like a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast where he gets like really deep
into soil science and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've heard him recommend between like
6.5 and 6.7 in general, if you're using
[SPEAKER_04]: like a living soil type system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you are looking to pH something in a
soil system, I would recommend aiming for
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere in that range.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny that you said, cause I
believe mine was in the very beginning,
[SPEAKER_06]: AKA was at 6.7.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once everything was all cooked and
everything after about 30 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, I would say maybe 20 to 30
minutes left.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, bump cat, there are a couple of,
what was this?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's like growing organically in
confined spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sort of have touched on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's something you
wanted to talk more about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have general tips and maybe
like controversial points of discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I'll let you decide like, you know,
what do you reckon we should talk about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I feel like we can go into the general
tips area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I have a couple down, um, but at least
for me come like learning the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the biggest pitfalls coming into
growing indoors, um, organically is
[SPEAKER_04]: watering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not knowing what or why you're
watering at, um, like specific additives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, everything that you put in your water
to go into your media, you should have a
[SPEAKER_04]: general understanding of what's relatively
going to be happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the amount of water that you're
putting into your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I heard screw mentioned six gallons
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done very similar things and found
that all of a sudden the plant is just,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might as well just cut it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's not going to grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, I believe that essentially
watering and understanding what's in that
[SPEAKER_04]: water and why you're doing that is a huge
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you don't know, ask questions,
you would be absolutely amazed at who is
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to answer you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my DMs are always open.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody ever has any questions,
obviously, but I've gone to growers that I
[SPEAKER_04]: really respect on Instagram and I've just
sent him a DM out of, out of the blue,
[SPEAKER_04]: hoping maybe that they can get back to me
with an answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more often than not, it's like 90% of
the time somebody will come back and give
[SPEAKER_04]: you some really good advice or maybe
something to think about that can help.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all people are always there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid and don't be, don't let
your ego not let you ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always something to learn and
somebody can always teach you something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if it's wrong, you'll learn that it's
wrong eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, join our discord.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, that's the perfect one to do a
bit of chilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Join, join the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: That organic forum in the discord is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love going in there and reading and
catching up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe it was just there, but I guess
there are a number of threads in it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't actually looked into it in a
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go give it a read.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in the discord, it's,
it's super fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's really nice and always willing
to help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, everybody's pretty positive in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And always a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, biggest advice for growing in
organics in general is keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: This plant can get really complicated,
really, really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't overcomplicate things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're confused, just fall back to the
basics, water and soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the food, if there's food in the media,
the plant will feed itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're worried about overwatering,
give it a couple hours, come back and
[SPEAKER_04]: check on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more than a million.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ways to come back and come like look at
the plant to make sure it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a lot of people like to drown their
plants with love.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very common mistake as well in
organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, cleanliness in general, everything in
organics is about staying five steps ahead
[SPEAKER_04]: of all the pests in every regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an absolute pain in the ass,
but it's essentially really the only way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you get a really bad overpopulation
of something in your soil, if you get
[SPEAKER_04]: like, uh, like isopods were mentioned
earlier or fungus gnats or root aphids,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're in an individual pot,
you can pull that pot out and get rid of
[SPEAKER_04]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but there is also the thought that
don't be afraid to run a crop to harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, even if you panic and think it's going
to be run, uh, like ruined, you can always
[SPEAKER_04]: learn something from taking something to
the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've taught myself a whole bunch of
stuff of like, you can rebound a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty well, even when you think it's
gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you can just baby it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, another big one is don't be reliant on
specific companies or products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, meaning if you find something that you
get a positive result from, keep using it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also understand what the ingredients
are in that product.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's creating that positive reaction
that you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, if the product ever goes out
of stock or is no longer sold,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have a means of understanding what was
happening and you can go find a
[SPEAKER_04]: replacement product that is just as good
or maybe even better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, that's kind of my, my general
tips for organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about, yeah, Kyle and Kristen,
uh, you know, on reflection, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: what would you, what would you,
what advice would you give people who are
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe starting or thinking about starting
organic?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would definitely, uh, start out,
uh, I would have started out more simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you know, I, I don't delve right in,
but I kind of knew what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beforehand, cause I'd already,
you know, I've already started,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, reading about stuff and doing
all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of knew beforehand, but,
uh, yeah, cause you can do basic,
[SPEAKER_06]: real basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, luckily with the revenue book,
I mean, he has real simple recipes that
[SPEAKER_06]: you can do to even just do trial runs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way, if it's, uh, something that,
uh, you just don't like, you can,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you didn't waste a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, uh, yeah, I mean, bum cat,
he pretty much, uh, a lot of the stuff he
[SPEAKER_06]: just said was, you know, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, um, you know, I don't stay ahead
of the past maybe as I should,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know, it's like I said,
you know, uh, I like to see stuff because
[SPEAKER_06]: my system's a little bit different than
just a basic, uh, well, not basic,
[SPEAKER_06]: but just, uh, the normal living soil of
what people think type of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause TLO is its own thing, uh,
in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Kristen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any tips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, probably the biggest tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I guess the most problems I see
people having are watering either too
[SPEAKER_00]: little or too much or too frequent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and like light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most, most of the time, if you just,
if you got like problems going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: either dim your lights or raise them and
focus in on how you're watering and that
[SPEAKER_00]: until you start to actually learn the
system a little bit better, that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be most of your problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you see people who, you know,
start out, Oh, is it a, is it a mag issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a, you know, calcium problem,
you know, when really they just need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more consistently, um, water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely have seen this a lot where
you can get from watering issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do get downstream lockout deficiency
issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not always a direct diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you see, uh, you know,
leaf, chlorosis, necrosis, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately mean that it's a nutrient
issue, although it, it could be an issue,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it could be caused by an upstream
watering problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one of the things that I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just get like way more confused,
way more lost in troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with a overwatering because,
uh, I, I, I'm a constant over.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my main thing, even since I was
first starting, you know, that's mostly
[SPEAKER_06]: what a lot of people do is overwater,
over love stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, I still am, I still have that
problem of slightly overwatering stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and that, that what I believe causes a
potassium issue, which then causes
[SPEAKER_06]: magnesium and all kinds of lockouts and
stuff afterward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is, which is, which actually,
which, which usually is what you see a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of the organic, a lot of the droopiness.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's usually the, what I,
it's usually the overwatering.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can really see it, especially in the
organic beds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A really good general rule I've found,
um, based off of experience that I got
[SPEAKER_04]: from, um, one of the builder soil videos
way back in the day was a roughly fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to water roughly about five to
10% of your total volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're watering in organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so for example, if you're in like a 10
gallon pot, you're going to water water
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere in the range of a half gallon to
a whole gallon total for every time that
[SPEAKER_04]: you water.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's obviously not going to be that
exactly every single time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very much based on
individuals and their preferences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that generally will give you a
really good guide of watering,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not overwatering or over loving the
plant when you're actually going back
[SPEAKER_04]: into, um, doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, any other, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else here, Bumcat general tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, don't be reliant on any individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be diversify your sources of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody can always teach you something no
matter what you've heard from somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if they're doing something wrong,
you'll learn in time that you're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: something wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you're willing to do the research,
you might learn a little bit faster,
[SPEAKER_04]: but always diversify where you're getting
your information from because somebody can
[SPEAKER_04]: always teach you something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know what it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a good point?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, for me to ask you guys to like maybe
shout out some of the most important
[SPEAKER_05]: books, articles, whatever that you've,
you've found.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have any of those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go a couple right off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the KNF manual, super helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, give you, gives you like really
detailed breakdowns of different styles of
[SPEAKER_04]: fermentation and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jam is also very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you can literally just pop those
literally KNF and J A D A M are the two
[SPEAKER_04]: spellings and you literally just pop them
into Amazon.
[SPEAKER_04]: The books will pop right up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're translated into pretty much every
single language you can think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're super, super readable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they can get pretty in depth at
certain points, but they provide all the
[SPEAKER_04]: necessary information in that book for you
to understand those, uh, systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for something like
living soil or, um, no till I would
[SPEAKER_04]: really, really highly recommend Jeff
Lowenfeld's teaming with series.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got three books.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there might be a fourth one
published or a fourth one on the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's like teaming with microbes,
teaming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then the, I don't, I can't
remember the third one really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really highly recommend those to anybody
who's more on the beginner side and just
[SPEAKER_04]: looking to get a really good grasp of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You in all honesty, you can just get the
first book, the teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that book will teach you everything
you need to know about the basics of soil
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll break it down into really simple
language for you, really simple
[SPEAKER_04]: definitions, and it'll give you all the
necessary essentially foundation for you
[SPEAKER_04]: to understand that system as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you're not into reading,
I would really, really highly recommend
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeremy Silva from build a soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their YouTube channel has literally
hundreds of hours of high quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: really in depth, um, content growing
literally in their hydroponic shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've actually met Jeremy in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a really great guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, grows great weed too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can say that a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, he's given me samples of a couple
things and everything I've smoked from has
[SPEAKER_04]: been amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, those systems do work really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would recommend all of those sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you're more of an old form kind of
guy, I would recommend go and looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: Clackamas Coot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy will always have great
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he's, he gets very detailed,
very quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that might be somebody, something on
the little bit more advanced spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: His vocabulary will get really large,
really quick on you, but, uh, those are a
[SPEAKER_04]: general direction for if you're looking
for any of those types of systems and more
[SPEAKER_04]: information on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kyle Scrustin, uh, any shout outs for,
uh, sources of information?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, well, I've already pretty much
mentioned it all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously the rev, uh, you know,
he has his own YouTube page now,
[SPEAKER_06]: so now he's starting to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, that's kinda, that's a little bit
better cause it actually shows,
[SPEAKER_06]: he actually goes through and shows how he
does everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, even, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even the mixing and stuff, he puts it
on a large, uh, an example of a small
[SPEAKER_06]: scale and then how you would do it on a
large scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of cool how he does it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, he's a funny guy too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, cause he's just an old stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, and then the other ones are
Rodale's, uh, Rodale's ultimate
[SPEAKER_06]: encyclopedia for organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, like I said, it has every,
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has, uh, everything and it's an older
book.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been around for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, another one's the composting for like
recycling, uh, your soil and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Rodale's book of composting and,
uh, for worms, uh, if you're doing any
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of worm bins, uh, worms eat my
garbage.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a kid's book, but you know,
it's an older one, but it's a,
[SPEAKER_06]: the basic like first worm book that I know
of.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah, that's really basically it
that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, cause, uh, bump cat mentioned the low
and fells books.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've read those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and that's really pretty much all I
can think of off the top of my head and
[SPEAKER_06]: looking through my closet real quick at
the books I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can always, um, we can always add stuff
to the video description.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we think of them later, I'll try,
I'll try to remember to like link some of
[SPEAKER_05]: these things if I can, when we publish the
video.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for anybody on the discord,
I have, I link all the, uh, revs,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, YouTube stuff once it comes up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I keep up with it and I comment on the
stuff and any time stuff comes up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a really good archivist,
Kyle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've, you upload lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, yeah, I really try, you know,
that's, that's kind of my thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, that's just, I'm kind of a
historian type of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's, that's my deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, cause I really love it, man.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thanks man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so yeah, the, I guess I could shout
out myself, uh, go to the breeder
[SPEAKER_06]: syndicate Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check out all of the, some of the
historical stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't put everything on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of it's on the discord pretty much,
but, uh, every once in a while,
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to post historical stuff and,
uh, yeah, you can see some of my,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, plans on there too, every once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'll try to remember to link that
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's Kristen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got started like down this path
from, uh, from Coot just reading his
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but from there, I might mostly
look at, you know, non-canna stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most of it is just farming YouTubes
and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, no, that's great though.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a good point, which is that you
can look outside of like cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: discourse for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cause I mostly, you know,
I mostly focus on like making my own
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, that's what I, you know,
mostly do like heavy research into.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out that Rodale's man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might, you like that then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot me a link.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to find it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to check out the Rev,
his YouTube channel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I was like, he's funny and,
you know, he's not, he doesn't take
[SPEAKER_06]: himself seriously, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's willing to admit mistakes and,
you know, you see his plants on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, he shows everything and that's
what I liked about him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's transparent and yeah, he's a really
cool guy from, from what I've seen anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know personally, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if we actually get him on the show,
we can get some of you back on to ask him
[SPEAKER_05]: questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, cause Matt, you know, Matt and I are
not really like the right people for the
[SPEAKER_05]: organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I might need your help again,
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so we kind of in the, like,
really we're wrapping up now and,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, any final thoughts, Bumcat or any
other prompts, uh, before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this has been pretty much covered it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go through the real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I think that's really,
that's really it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I would really highly recommend
anybody who wants to join the syndicate,
[SPEAKER_04]: join the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a super fun group of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We learn, I'm constantly learning from
everybody in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've made a couple of really, really good
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Join the syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any final thoughts or shout outs from Kyle
or Kristen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, thanks again for having me on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you know, I'm really honored that,
uh, anybody would even think of me having
[SPEAKER_06]: me on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, cause I don't think very much myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, yeah, definitely join the
syndicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's always funny over there,
you know, we're always joking around.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't, don't join if you have very
specific opinions that you're,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, um, that you are offended if
other people don't share.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause, cause I can only step in the ring
so many times, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's Kristen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, jump on in the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well worth the $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, like it's always a great help,
honestly, to get people from the community
[SPEAKER_05]: to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's been a great direction
for us to move into, uh, to supplement and
[SPEAKER_05]: or compliment like the other, other shows
that we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's really been, I think a fun and
productive set of conversations every time
[SPEAKER_05]: we do one of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, I think people really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, shout out to Matt who couldn't make it
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, again, yeah, I did, I did poke at Matt
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes he's not the most enthusiastic
about growing at the shows, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: he, he still shows up and like,
it gives us two cents.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did miss him today and apologies to
everyone that they have to stare at our
[SPEAKER_05]: avatar instead of Matt's face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, cause the other funny thing about
Matt's face is that like, he can't hide
[SPEAKER_05]: any reaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if, if you're walking his face and
you see everything's written on his face,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether he likes something or he doesn't
like something, you'll see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we're, we're missing out today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks everyone so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for giving us your Friday evening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my last shout outs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to do the Matt thing, uh,
riotseeds.com for, um, riot, tart,
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of lonesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Jill, um, probably feeding people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the rev might still have gear on
there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of the rev, um, we have lifted,
lifted genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we have grip by seeds for Australia,
New Zealand, and we have riotseed.co
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe for Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And join the discord as everyone has said
multiple times this episode.
