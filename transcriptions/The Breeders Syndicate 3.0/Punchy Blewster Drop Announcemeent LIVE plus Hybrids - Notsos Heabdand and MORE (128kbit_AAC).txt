[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Matthew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do a quick talk about our
punchy bluster drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not a normal drop like most of
our drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to think of a way to kind of
walk everyone down this journey with us
[SPEAKER_00]: while we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing projects since the initial
and second blue bonnet drop, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: almost, I think, three years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've continued doing the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working through the lines,
we did some work with the blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: McMuffins, because I wanted to see how
that crossed, what was in that line,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was in the F gens of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was interested in working that into
other bonnet lines and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been projects going on in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always ask, what am I up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really ever have great
answers, because it just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to share that I'm doing boring
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through lines is kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought of a way to be able to open
this up to some of our Patreon members and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that want to go through some of this
stuff with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it, I don't usually use
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it so I can see the wider
pool and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been one of the people who
pushes back on using any sort of testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I like to see all the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, it's more of a fun
journey through a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some stuff written out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it'll help illustrate some of
the drop, how it worked, what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing, what you can expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get an idea if you even want to
go on this journey, and if this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something you'd be into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it is, which one of these lines
would be suitable for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during my journey through the several
blueberry hunts over 17 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: operating, I've come to some deep
realizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point when you've worked with a
line enough, specifically the blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: line, and how it breeds to so many
different clones that I've worked with for
[SPEAKER_00]: just as long, that it's a completely
predictable breeder for me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've experienced,
even super stunk, that I've worked with a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton and understand and understand traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't read what it's going to breed
like, like I can with blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, if that explains that a
little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to take the work further into
double and tripled up bonnet hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, ensuring constant steps to work
away from inbreeding, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry breeding trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's so predictable,
I can cross it to several known cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: know how they will cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a peek at some of that work I've
been doing with my breeding apprentice
[SPEAKER_00]: here locally, Space Invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the guys locally that I had
met some years back that happened to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the show and be local and was just super
passionate about taking his whole grow
[SPEAKER_00]: game to the next level by learning
breeding hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been an excellent student.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a few different crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we were focusing on five main
hybrids, letting people see the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been going on over the last three
years as we dive deeper into these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tester name number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the tester names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is solid just because like the
they weren't ever meant to be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just tag names, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creamy Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the cream crossed a punchy
punchy bluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cream's original name tester name was
Silverberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people knew it as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd never had a big release because and
I'll explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When doing the initial crosses of the blue
bonnet, I wasn't giving the silver pearl
[SPEAKER_00]: mom at the at this point when I was doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at this stage of friendships,
we don't ask each other for cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gifted when people feel like it and
it's done out of respect on both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like a stingy type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given a few silver pearl S1s a bit
before the drop was done by Souvenir
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found one of those that was a taller
version of the mother, similar nose and
[SPEAKER_00]: resin production, just a bigger apical
cola and not a squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: She grew about five and a half feet tall
and was so much faster than the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she had beautiful resin production and
beautiful turf profile and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly, the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was put in the room as filler space
because I wanted to know what bonnet
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed to with one of the pearls because
it's one of my favorite turf profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bonnet inherently like I was doing the
bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it was a bubble gummy type
smell and not like pink bubble gum,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a different type of gummy type smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, yeah, I wanted to get it crossed
in some sort before catastrophe happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work I work on Murphy's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it rights law around here because
it is so constant, the worst shit that can
[SPEAKER_00]: go wrong will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to operate with that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made these seeds, but it was asked
not to let anyone grow them or sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the original perfect pearl blue bonnet
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I waited a few years and eventually was
given permission to let them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sub Rob did a beautiful grow of some
stellar individuals that were right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle, silver pearl and bonnet,
just extreme resin production and a very
[SPEAKER_00]: take on the beautiful bubble gummy baby
poo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smelled the baby poo,
but everyone else does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to say it's there for
most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I just don't smell it with a stellar
buzz that calls back to the Mexicans of
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely see why Nev spent Neville
spent his later years searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: Watkins that reminded him of the early pro
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely my favorite work with Nev
and Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it stood the test of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the best selection from the cream
and I believe there were four females that
[SPEAKER_00]: hovered right around the similar
expression that we liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should breed similar, but only one
way to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this punchy male that we used for all
the all the hybrids was selected using
[SPEAKER_00]: trait selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Method visual trait ID I did when
selecting the blue bonnet male,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative material smelled like
blueberry way more than any of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnets or the countless other blueberry
iterations that run.
[SPEAKER_00]: He simply has all of his family sticking
up at seventy five, eighty degree angles
[SPEAKER_00]: from top to bottom, looking like he's
raising his hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've now selected that trait in the
white monnet punchy bubble berry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right berry B2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single time when I use a male
from any of those lines that had any had
[SPEAKER_00]: that trait, he passes every single visual
trait that that bonnet does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bonnet male did, I should say,
even in his punchy hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these, he lets the banana punch offer
in some beautiful and much needed yield
[SPEAKER_00]: for some super commercial viability
because bonnet on its own is a delicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: cushy, smaller yielding girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are serious chonkers coming out
of the punchy lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect a lot of grape and blueberry with
this really wild infusion of bubble gum,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not pink bubble gum, bubble gum and
sickly sweetness that is just coated in
[SPEAKER_00]: resin that's perfect for bubble hash and
washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The punchy and bonnet lines are
specifically bred to be washed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the punchy brought a level of resin
production to some of these lines that's
[SPEAKER_00]: staggering, even in the realm of deep
chunk standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this hybrid, some of these clock in
between seven and nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry is fast, as is silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to if you want speed and
flower and turn around time with insane
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my right pick for all the hybrids
as being the one most people will be
[SPEAKER_00]: receptive to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the punchy bluster F2 tester
named punchy to stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has been a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I originally made the punchy line,
I was a bit dismissive of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: reception to me using a clone like banana
punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not adverse to using modern lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, during the time I was more
focused on old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a bit of a range, you know,
a bit off the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love skunk text cut he brought to me of
his selection of symbiotics, banana punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the homie who made the punch
supernova gardens to like he doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly enough credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is just a wonderful dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite people hating on punch for its
potency, they don't have a fucking clue on
[SPEAKER_00]: this and what this can do for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cuts that you grow to crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those are crappy breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato three or sorry, Gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for cropping, but trash for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it's fully inbred
commercial cookies at its worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm speaking from experience as the
first dummy to make the s ones of those
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes there's cuts that have
more value inside of them than can be seen
[SPEAKER_00]: with the naked eye or observed by smoking
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's the actual genetic data
inside that needs unlocking with the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find grape smells and blueberry jam
smells to be ideal partners in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases with this being the prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did 30 something bonnet crosses overall
in the initial runs and chose to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: few forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a hard choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The punchy F ones were given away as a
promotion to help start a seed bank for a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend that no one has ever heard of,
you know, like, you know how you do for
[SPEAKER_00]: friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was how we got to see a bunch of
these dried out really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people's minds were blown.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind was blown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding potential of that banana
punch cut was unlocked and game gene eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, game gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the bonnet male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bonnet male is special and unique
enough to pass that linked visual trait
[SPEAKER_00]: with raised leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punchy bluster F twos, while inherently
being more diverse than the original
[SPEAKER_00]: release, will still hold very true to the
original looks and smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonnet is uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And true breeding for several traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really tightens up the
generations as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect way more uniformity than you're
used to seeing in F twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have great Kool-Aid, great Fun Dip,
blueberry jam, blueberry grape explosion,
[SPEAKER_00]: double grape berry cheesecake,
all caked in resin and beautiful shades of
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the folks love and demand at
seriously potent high delivers the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: percent that all the uninformed custies
demand to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the turp percent for bonnet work is
crushing the game right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regularly over three percent total
turps and in some crosses over seven and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something special about this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here to break every tradition and
idea of what blueberry is and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: should have always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering time with this one is going to
be eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The occasional seven fast lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really proud of this line and the work
that's been done by everyone leading up to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a labor of love and one I'm very
proud to put my name on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one we did was the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush headband of Natso's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossed to Chem Dog D by CSI Humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we crossed that punchy bluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tester name is not so punchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the homie space invader was already
running and doing selections of his own on
[SPEAKER_00]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, Chem Dog D when we were talking
about starting projects together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his grows of it sold me on his
capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selection of it is strong,
strong, super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how a double up of super skunk goes
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens often when you introduce
the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush and not a Kush but a super skunky
sour diesel type that not so dog calls
[SPEAKER_00]: headband and Chem Dog D.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are pretty sure it's Chem 91 super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you know, people have stories of
reputations to protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can pretend I didn't say those parts
out loud for the sensitive folks over
[SPEAKER_00]: there in that corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right away, I was like, this makes
sense for the project, both not so and CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: or some of my closest friends on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make a line where we could see all
kinds represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could have found a way to smuggle in
pack and H&L, it would have been perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but obviously less uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get there one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we get here is a different take on
the super skunk double up great berry
[SPEAKER_00]: explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What occurs is usually a middle ground of
berry grape with booty font, mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: popping up with a lower percent of bland
diesel types with pretty banging highs at
[SPEAKER_00]: not much berry and a small percent that
are this beautiful, tiny little acrid
[SPEAKER_00]: berry type that are hardly yielding,
but, you know, 10 grams a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like this is this is in small pots and
stuff like that, but they're tiny little
[SPEAKER_00]: yielders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given a proper veg time and root space,
this discretion pops up regularly in lines
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skunk spray can blue bonnet,
sour bonnet, and a ton in the day record
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel blue bonnets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a hunter and want to find
extremely triple dank head stash that will
[SPEAKER_00]: like white out your friends, check out
this line of or any of the others above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of times would be 8-11 weeks
because a diesel type is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see the 11 weekers push their way
through from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four, the GMO root beer funk bag
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really bag seed, but it's it's it's an
unknown, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossed a punchy bluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called this what the fuck, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: WTF, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like it's it was confusing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a minute to remember exactly
what these seeds were that me and skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: tech had run through my seed blowers of
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had one line of a hybrid with mean gene
that I enjoyed called GMO root beer funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super black licorice and just
really stony and strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few years later, I was cleaning out
old stuff and found a bag with a few
[SPEAKER_00]: preemie seeds and said, screw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's toss those in and see what comes of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're amazing plants, but the smells
were not in the direction I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, it reminds me of a bland
old Afghani lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, I was disappointed because it
wasn't like anything turf wise I wanted or
[SPEAKER_00]: was expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to sell this as a
blueberry root beer because honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not the the turfs that I'm seeing,
you know, in the expressions we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wouldn't be fair to anyone
involved, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Customers, gene, skunk tech, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to state here what we have is
a super potent blank canvas to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: punchy bluster to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's genetics for the black
licorice smells from the root beer GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: funk are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes a little dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was extreme black licorice
goodness in those mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, we decided it was a really good
and worth releasing despite the name
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion and really felt like it deserved
a real transparent explanation on the
[SPEAKER_00]: turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because one of my favorite things in
life is getting emails from people telling
[SPEAKER_00]: me that they're the first time growers of
my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time, they got a plant
that looks and smells like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brager said, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I live for it because the first and
foremost, I'm a grower and know how rare
[SPEAKER_00]: of an experience that's become,
especially for folks using cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato because it all looks like gelato at
some point to pop a pack of seeds and have
[SPEAKER_00]: potent high and turps exactly as
described.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm new to these lines combined on
the mother side, the prediction scale is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I expect purples, grape and berry
and tons of resin to sneak in at any
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flaring time would be somewhere between
eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's super potent and worth
exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like I am very hesitant to not
give full transparency on it because of
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is, how it came to be and that the
name doesn't quite match.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics of the names don't quite
match what we saw, but that's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: representation on gene or anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a small pop of what was in
the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call this one friendly fire for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first bonnet triple
extravaganza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue skittles crossed a blue bonnet,
crossed a blueberry McMuffins,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Mac one blue bonnet crossed a
punchy bluster, banana punch blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three way injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time I brought three of
the bonnet lines together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One I love the resin production on and
ease of growth on the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like the challenge of teaching
people how to get that clone to make seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: reliably for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the blueberry McMuffin F2 round,
I had popped in some of the very few
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles clonally crossed a bonnet seeds
that looked viable enough to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never popped that line or sold it
because so few seeds made it to maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the chaos of moving grows,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was stoked to see how it combined
with the bonnet later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a 10 seed pop, four females were
all Z dominant in terms, but looks were
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell growth structure stem wise with
skittles as well as bud structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: overall beauty potency, but I couldn't
bury that skittles turp in one move with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured let's toss it into the Mac
one bonnet repro room when the Mac one
[SPEAKER_00]: took a back seat to the bonnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hybrids of this are insanely gorgeous
looking like more compact cushy versions
[SPEAKER_00]: of Mac one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps combined with more berry coming
through, but still extremely Z dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last fix in my opinion would
instead be to try the punchy around a line
[SPEAKER_00]: that is turp dominant to most,
turp dominant to most with heavy grape and
[SPEAKER_00]: berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project was done to not stack hype
beast necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done with the intention and goal in
mind of combining the winning looks of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac one cut, some of the Z turp with the
berry more of a dominant feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stacked the deck in my favor based on
what I've seen in my experience and using
[SPEAKER_00]: bonnet and blueberry to try to pull this
one off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like, you could be one of the
very few that go on this journey with us
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if we met this goal or others in
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked to finally have a solid crew of
good growers to put all this stuff out
[SPEAKER_00]: there to test and really give unbiased
opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this line expect seven to nine weeks
flowering time, lots of sea of green
[SPEAKER_00]: types, more squat Afghani looking things
with beautiful colors and just built for
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth washing extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pretty much covers the,
I don't want to say it's a drop because
[SPEAKER_00]: like we're only letting some out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have a bunch of seeds,
we're going through them ourselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're letting just a few packs out while
we're going through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's your chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wild journey we've been on
trying to re-instill like interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I really feel like that was an art of
breeding that's been lost interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have a better understanding of
what they're reading when these seed
[SPEAKER_00]: makers say they're doing certain moves or
genetic moves and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I hope all this has been helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope anybody who runs these lines finds
it helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to send me any questions,
hit up me anytime on the discord and the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord has a section that's open for free
to everyone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one has any excuse not to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click the link tree in any of my bios or
any of the YouTube videos or any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram bios and you'll make it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for showing up.
