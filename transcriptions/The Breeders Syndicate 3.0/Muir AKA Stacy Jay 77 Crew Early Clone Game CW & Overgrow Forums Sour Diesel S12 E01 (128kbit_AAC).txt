[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_01]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm here with Stacy J, AKA Muir,
as he was known on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been chasing you down for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a very well-respected member of our
community, and it's an honor to have you
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done other interviews yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did an interview with my buddy Chip
Baker in the... What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Real Dirt Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that a couple times, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more of a stand at the back of the
room kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be at the front, man,
because you have a lot of history and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of answers and a lot of stuff I'd like
to dig out of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, we usually dive into
the easy stuff, which is what was your
[SPEAKER_01]: earliest intro to weed as far as just
smoking, your first intro to seeing this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I grew up around early charismatic
Christians and 1% bikers.
[SPEAKER_02]: My old man had an excavating company and
he had a lot of bikers who were in a club
[SPEAKER_02]: called the Pagans.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite and most awesome smells
I ever smelled was herb burning in my old
[SPEAKER_02]: man's office.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the best smell ever and probably
first smoked it 13-ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_02]: At probably a church camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So were your parents the charismatic
Christians?
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom was, but my dad was a cokehead or a
raving coke addict more than a cokehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charismatic cokehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evangelical cokehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one of those too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of weed was around when you
first started smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: What era are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I was 16, and that's when I
became enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get out from under your parents' wing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got your car.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go get some herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say that everything that you
would have seen in the old high times,
[SPEAKER_02]: trans high market quotation, there was a
variety of imports.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were a little bit older than me,
you would be much more savvy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 16 and getting whatever it was that
the older guys were selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you had everything from Jamaican to
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the first QP I bought was Acapulco
Gold and it was down on the DC line
[SPEAKER_02]: because I grew up in the DC suburbs of
Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the DC line area was a traditional
illegal sales area and where we could
[SPEAKER_02]: always buy underage booze or what have
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was real golden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some Thai weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never saw any Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just became pretty much maxi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it became maxi and kind bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was two kinds of commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the commercial that was
getting to me in the DC area, which I sold
[SPEAKER_02]: brickweed and grew my own pot,
that stuff was ironically coming via
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado Springs and Boulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you just popping seeds that you had
from your stash when you first started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I first popped seeds when I was 17,
right before I went into the Army Reserves
[SPEAKER_02]: on a bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the seeds weren't there when I got,
or the plants weren't there when I came
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they get harvested?
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clones, you know, back then when I
started to grow, I think it would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been the thing that I have in my mind as a
timestamp of that era of beginning was it
[SPEAKER_02]: was the Grateful Dead version of the
Warlock shows in Hampton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not a dead show, but that's like,
OK, this is when I started growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is about 89.
[SPEAKER_02]: And clones were that they were really hard
to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeds were really hard to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew some people in Virginia and
they grew like mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the first real seeds that I
popped that were not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: throw away Maxi seeds would have been a
hash haze cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ironically, again, those seeds had an
origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were made in Eagle, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this old grower that I knew went on a
road trip and he brought these seeds back
[SPEAKER_02]: and we had a shit ton of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew that pot a lot.
And.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still what I consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind, but it's still that that imprinted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Profile that knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like good ganja when.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't good ganja in there wasn't a lot
of good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it long flowering since it was a haze
hybrid?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we didn't flower shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't have a chance to flower it fucking
long, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that is definitely learned along the
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was it was it was
typical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't it wasn't some long flowering
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all while you're in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Maryland, it kind of just like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird to me because I think about D
.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and like the risks involved with that
being some kind of extra federal
[SPEAKER_01]: territory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, ironically.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the early 90s, I believe it would have
been during a Clinton administration that
[SPEAKER_02]: someone in D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: and Dupont Circle called the White House
and threatened.
[SPEAKER_02]: The president and he had plants growing
and he was tripping balls, and I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: that that was the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivation arrest in Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but Maryland was scary and Virginia
was really scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grocery store that we went to was
called Home Harvest and he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from the prankster school
prankster school of thought, the Yippee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normal organizer, and he always put his
grocery stores right next to the bong and
[SPEAKER_02]: dildo stores, so that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it was a great strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked for him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get your bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get your dildos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that that store was called Home
Harvest and guy's name was Jeff Edwards
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's dead now, but he's a real
inspiration to my business, Harvest House
[SPEAKER_02]: and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really good guy, a really
incredible resource to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to remember that this is the.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just post Operation Green
Merchant era and everybody was scared
[SPEAKER_02]: shitless because they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very free and order and everything online
with credit cards and all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came to an end and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you went from being carefree and
casual to people walking quarter mile down
[SPEAKER_02]: the road to the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point did you shoot out to
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there any anything we should cover
before then that you can think of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I did a did 10 months in San Rafael,
Santa Venetia outside of San Rafael,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too, I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time I ever paid 55 bucks for an
8th.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was shocking to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but that was like 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was definitely not the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the high point of my growing career
moved back to Maryland, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ended up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: From briefly in 97 and then full time
never leaving again in 98.
[SPEAKER_02]: What moved you out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that I knew in Maryland who
didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Move to the Bay Area, California,
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ended up moving to Netherland,
Colorado, so I had a really huge,
[SPEAKER_02]: not huge, but I had a.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of friends here and it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's got a really big musical
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a kind of a hippie enclave,
kind of the white like Laurel Canyon or.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar places where band members in the
70s congregated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caribou Ranch recording studio just
outside of town that tons of music was
[SPEAKER_02]: recorded at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big drug town music town in the
90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could bar hop in this town most nights
amongst like 3-4 places in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live music and it's a town of about 1400.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but all that is changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado's changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the world's changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Covid and all the money changed Colorado,
so there's very, you know we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: 8 or 9 pre regulation pot shops in this
town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine was one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a pot town anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not a pot town anymore so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you got to Colorado, what kind of
strains were kicking around Colorado that
[SPEAKER_01]: you remember first encountering?
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones I brought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so what were you bringing over
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had just.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to Mark Emery's and.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bought four grand worth of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, spent four grand with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all get got some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you the the seed story you know
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the strip search story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is this is the one I want to
hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know Mark had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magazine that was basically a format for
his catalog with the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know 8 pages of the damn thing and
and in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was like fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want this and you know it was a mix of
really expensive Dutch seed and that was
[SPEAKER_02]: in reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not authentic yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tons of BC strains that I wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still had you know access or even memory
of yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go in, you know here I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm young, hadn't really traveled too much
and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's Hastings area was,
you know, Junkieville back then and.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was a kind of city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not exposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meet Mark, go do the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark gives me handwritten directions to a
town called Tofino on the Sunshine Coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: And gotta go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot, you know talking it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the weather was shitty and and rainy
and I got the worst hotel in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: full of old creepy motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like board.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was the only room and it was
just torrentially raining so I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a receipt saver, but I just happen
to have the receipt for that night and.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come to meet one of the people that
sells seeds to Mark from Europe and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we hit it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go into business,
do all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Business plans and stuff in my notebook
and.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, what are you doing
with your seats?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, I I'm just going to bring
him home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark said nobody's ever been interdicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and he's like, oh no, you can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta send them back to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I delay my flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mail him back, meet the guy the next
morning on the street, smoke couple three
[SPEAKER_02]: joints, jump in the cab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel in my pocket the big of the day
pink Federal Express receipt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I'm totally stoned in the back of the
cabin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking when I get to the airport,
throw this away and I had this little
[SPEAKER_02]: nervous habit of folding shit up and then
rolling it up and I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the a potish is one of the
names for the little nervous things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so I jump out of the cab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throw this thing in my pocket and I walk
into the BC airport and there's dogs at
[SPEAKER_02]: the door and they sit down as I walk by
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, you go right over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, holy fuck, there's US customs in
the BC airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like driving across California
line with 300 clones in a cooler and not
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing there's an agricultural
checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's.
[SPEAKER_02]: There I am, the D or the the customs and
immigration has got me against the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unworking conveyor belt with my backpack
all exploded all over the place and
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at all of my seed packages that
I'm going to take and put back in my,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when I get back along with,
you know, several dozen packs of rolling
[SPEAKER_02]: papers you couldn't get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The US and my written down business plans
that I'm going to do with this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this little old lady who is a
supervisor, I'm trying to be nice to her
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other dude comes over and he's bad
cop with me and and.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all fucking with somebody else and
I'm standing there with my ass to the
[SPEAKER_02]: conveyor belt and I feel that fucking
receipt.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, this is the only thing between
like me and 100% good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm watching and I'm watching and I
eat the receipt because it's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they see me and they scream.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's eating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's eating it and they they come from
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they swore me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me into an examination room while
this D or the customs guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starts talking about if do I have a sign
on my house that says what I do or how
[SPEAKER_02]: long you been doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: They know all kinds of like cop mind fuck
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't strip search me because I
was on Canadian territory, so they had to
[SPEAKER_02]: go get a Mountie to strip search me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this handwritten directions to
Tofino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well.
[SPEAKER_02]: During this period of time, the the Hells
Angels, I believe, and other biker groups
[SPEAKER_02]: were kind of at war and and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Intimidating growers and making deals and
there was a long and short of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pot industry related murder that occurred
in Tofino.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the night that I stayed in that shitty
hotel and had the receipt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until I presented that receipt,
they were concerned about me being
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with that murder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a totally crazy weird thing
and.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it home and then they know my
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: How deep was the strip search?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, bent over and stick anything up
my ass, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all wanted to know now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was just, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just external.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a little peep peep show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, it wasn't the Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they go deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go deep with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, yeah, that those were great seeds,
but you know, in hindsight, I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: sure they the Dutch stuff wasn't really
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the guy's a scandal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you actually ever end up getting the
seeds that you had sent or was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Room for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I grew all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember what kind of strange you
were trying to grab at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically any of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it was, you know,
since he was the dominant thing back then
[SPEAKER_02]: and I I think that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think for the most part, the except for
maybe Maple Leaf Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think out of all that was the only thing
from since that ended up like sticking
[SPEAKER_02]: around for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm thinking of a
different, a different, different seed
[SPEAKER_02]: buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Amsterdam trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the early days, there was a guy
named Mike Parks who had a company called
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed Seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and Weed Seed was a British company
that went to Holland and bought seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: mailed them from England in fake Lady Di
memorabilia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: With him and met like Simon and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sagamarta, yeah, I'm having a brain cramp
on his knee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony, yeah, I actually met him when he was
in on the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got to Colorado, I was burning
through those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: The typical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff that you would hear about in Fort
Collins, my computer is doing some weird
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me quit something.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Colorado strains burning through
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I was hooked up with the
77 guys, so I was growing whatever they
[SPEAKER_02]: were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that because,
you know, I think some of us that were
[SPEAKER_01]: from the four Americans, some of us got a
good idea of the 77 crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even for me, it's kind of like just
this mythical group of guys that were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decades later, so I'd love to hear some
more about the 77 crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it get started?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it and what was the goal behind
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a whole lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet resources, obviously at that
point, so hemp BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had an HTML website that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely basic and I was not computer
savvy at all during that period of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but all of a sudden you could make
usernames and you could make these little
[SPEAKER_02]: back rooms and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like how I got my name was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had just traveled around California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was totally in the mirror woods and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and all that shit, so I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a flame or with a B hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ron, who you know, it's PGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suggested that I changed my handle after
this vicious back and forth with the.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because he went by Luminator back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he used the big 1500 Watt Stadium
Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, did he?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, he was totally easy to fuck with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Luminator and I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that's when he found out my
name was mirror.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's like mirror.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put an exclamation point on the end of
it and I and I kept it ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the you know, so the 77 was.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy, Eric 77 and it was the guy that
passed around the the very orange Calio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, AE 77 got and.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked out of a shop, didn't he?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was his shop?
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: He Berkeley patients group maybe or lived
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally not California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have ended up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have ended up with Ron in
California at some point, but not at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he died down South Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 77 was a back room that was
organized by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric and it became the 77.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vic High.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had.
[SPEAKER_02]: A back room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what it was called,
but a lot of these people had their little
[SPEAKER_02]: things and you would set up things and
burn them and and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: A group of us, you know, kind of congealed
in in the 77 and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think we all moved from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp BC there was a early website called
Laughing Moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you familiar with Laughing Moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, they were famous for having some
insanely priced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kong clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I remember the Kong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that's the first place I
remember strain based maybe being OK and.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had ended up with a back room.
[SPEAKER_02]: On.
[SPEAKER_02]: That website, the Laughing Moon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Website that became known as the 77.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that was like the established 77
base at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and from those guys,
you know, came the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over grow and and and cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so and they had, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Ron was the first person that I
went to and met.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California and I I became close with
California people because there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: perceived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Safety with people who are operating under
the California medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so definitely a perceived safety for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was the 77 crew was it was it
essentially a way to move clones across
[SPEAKER_01]: the nation to trade or is it just dudes
just hanging out and chilling that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just a bunch of dorks,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never into it, but the MIRC or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, a lot of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of those dorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for punk rock though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, a lot of those a lot of
those guys had a weird weird way about
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you wonder what other weird shit
they're lurking around on the channels
[SPEAKER_02]: they're on when you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always looked at those those guys a
little a little odd, but little sus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's really wild to to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, really well known names who,
you know, started out not knowing shit
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, just as weird little dorks
on cannabis web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sites, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but, you know, the the seventy seven,
you know, there was a time where those
[SPEAKER_02]: guys really took that shit seriously and
wouldn't, you know, even type out the
[SPEAKER_02]: seventy seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put asterisks in it or.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, secret agent shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it super serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, through the years,
I traveled to meet a lot of the folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could conveniently and even some that
weren't convenient and.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always been a extreme willingness
to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's no way that the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seventy seven was set up to to share
clones, but we shared the shit out of
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this was at the point where most
of us could even post an image online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else can I tell you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy seven crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us some of the notable characters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right around the time that Canada
World and Overgrowth started, what were
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the guys that left good
impressions on you or negative impressions
[SPEAKER_01]: on you for that matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because that's always
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Negative ones are easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sub cool is the first negative
one that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, boom, OK, well, we can start
with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he is he tried to get me to come
to Georgia and grow pot with him and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then it just became series
of disasters after disaster for that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was probably the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most negatively notable, you know,
I think people like Ron and CGA is really,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with his.
[SPEAKER_02]: His events and the stuff that he did to
support other people in their endeavors
[SPEAKER_02]: and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ron used to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Chip and I would call it the the
the old the old guy rescue program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember exactly how we we would
we called it, but he would, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he would take these guys from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other parts of the country and help them
get a foothold and yeah, and his area and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool to watch him do his thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he definitely helped me to same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old another generation, you know,
you know, and and for me, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys were older than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, circle, I was really a younger,
younger one of the circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, there's a.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot less of them, you know,
a lot of them came and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, did you ever meet Scoosh or
hear of Scoosh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Scoosh, I've heard of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was one of the people involved
with like the server for overgrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so, you know, Colorado ended up
getting a lot of genetics through my
[SPEAKER_02]: connections, you know, like the.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Naboo's cherry lime is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave flat of 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I'm Ricky, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheryline Ricky and he in that batch,
there was a strawberry something and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jacqueline Orange, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was from that era.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But did he get your sour from you,
too?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he got the sour from me or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent a grip of those West with Ron one
year on his yearly trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would have been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety nine, two thousand ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you because because a lot of
people don't know, like CSI, he attributes
[SPEAKER_01]: his sour coming around by you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where did you acquire the sour?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you run into it early on?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had this dude who was my running
partner at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a half Pakistani and half white kid
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, from the Bronx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he knew a bunch of deadheads in
Crested Butte who had this cut in called
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was getting stupid money like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, regular pot was forty eight
hundred bucks, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this was I can't even quote what it
was, but it was it was at that time was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody is like, it's different,
it's different, it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, ah, there's nothing
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got my cutting from these guys
that my buddy knew from Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they took all their back to New York
to sell it from Crested Butte.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where my my cutting came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's there's it's like a
shadow of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't ever fuck with it, but it's
still grown in in the valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's all Dead Tour related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's where that's how
it got around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned you weren't like much of
a dead guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of stuff are you into?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like I like the dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say that I came for the drugs
and stayed for the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I grew I grew up in a crazy
Christian church and was ejected from that
[SPEAKER_02]: at 16 and landed in the D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: punk scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a mid 80s man, Dick Discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Government issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw a minor threat, but,
you know, all of those discord bands and
[SPEAKER_02]: most incredible show I ever saw was
Butthole Surfers open for the Dead
[SPEAKER_02]: Kennedys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, I've never seen anything like
that in my life still to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I think it's in the top three,
four shows that I've seen that impacting
[SPEAKER_02]: like the minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he shouldn't have even come on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: But also did that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was high as shit on a bunch of
pagan crank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of the most insane
experiences ever, you know, because we had
[SPEAKER_02]: listened to these albums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a fucking tuba on
those albums, those early balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a big white tuba on
stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was that, you know, I've seen a lot
of Allman Brothers and Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_02]: two drum bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, you know, Butthole Surfers was
the first band I ever saw with two
[SPEAKER_02]: drummers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, growing up in the D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: area was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a small city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was approachable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was relatively safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a killer time to grow up in D
.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: I became a real into pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got really into pot,
I really wanted to grow it and sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I ended up going to see a
lot of dead shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a lot of Grateful Deadhead
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm a lot more into like
early Jerry projects versus like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Warlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like like Legion of Mary and stuff
with Merle Saunders and yeah, not not dead
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerry stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Warlocks are kind of like they
were one of those they're often considered
[SPEAKER_01]: proto punk in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the bands that always
interests me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a record out with the Falling
Spikes, which were Velvet Underground
[SPEAKER_01]: before they were Velvet Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the B side is the Warlocks that's
out there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Music nerd history.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you know about the DHK crew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you ever involved with any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reach was probably in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one I really jive with.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Colorado famous lines and cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear some.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Peabod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked to you briefly about this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you know about the Peabod?
[SPEAKER_02]: Peabod was grown in a town called Paonia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a name that is kind of a generic
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people typically talk about as
Peabod, I believe, would be called Paonia
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Paralyzer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that guy that I sent you the seeds of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The story that he tells me was that,
you know, Boulder was in the early 70s was
[SPEAKER_02]: a pretty significant hippie community,
and it was an earlier place for marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: trade and sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was surprised in hearing the
stories from this guy that there wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: ganja everywhere, but it was a developing
market at this point.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: So supposedly some hippies left Boulder
and moved to Paonia, and that's where the
[SPEAKER_02]: Peabod comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same line as what you have just separated
20 some years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that purple herb was also grown in
towns like Gardner, which was in the Wet
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain Valley, where you have,
you know, leave us alone kind of hippie
[SPEAKER_02]: type communities that don't really exist
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the way that they did then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's the only really what
I would consider like heirloom kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: hotspot would be Paonia and maybe Gardner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these, you know, places like
Leadville, it's over 10,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so a lot of these places where
everybody went to live in the mountains
[SPEAKER_02]: and smoke ganja and grow ganja,
it's really, really hard to grow outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can have, you know,
four inches of hail in August.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just you don't have anything and
it sticks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's like dirt and rocks
and pine trees around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not an easy, easy place to
grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Paonia is a farming area.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm sure it's still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure there's still people just in
the same way that you've got hippies on
[SPEAKER_02]: the mountain in Norcal that, you know,
are still doing stuff that's their own
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not what everybody else is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've often thought of trying to do what
you do for Colorado and try to get out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and capture some of the stories,
because, you know, California is is the
[SPEAKER_02]: mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Colorado is is a long, long standing
ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: State, but it's really it's more of a I
mean, long before Denver became the center
[SPEAKER_02]: of ganja in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Leadville.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Durango.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was everywhere but Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not where, you know, until people
started blowing up shitty warehouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that was that was the ganja Denver is
not a ganja town.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became the ganja center, would you say,
around the time of the legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first cannabis cup type shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, all these early gardens
were, you know, Denver was full of empty
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouses that were sitting and not doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was lots of cheap real estate
that you could get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody had any experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually ended up in one of these early
warehouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nobody had designed HVAC systems
for it yet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody could grow pot without powdery
mildew in those environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the herb was so horrible that it it's
responsible for the concentrate bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had all of this herb that was so
powdery mildew ridden that nobody could do
[SPEAKER_02]: shit with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't blast it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'd be dumpsters full of fucking
butane cans.
[SPEAKER_02]: People smoking a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within sight of my store here,
there is a house blow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within sight that way, there was a house
blow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three houses in the town of Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get pissed when you say that,
too, like that the extract artist whole
[SPEAKER_01]: idea came because a bunch of people tried
growing weed and were really shitty at it
[SPEAKER_01]: and had to try to move it somehow,
which became the BHO boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that to me, that's it was just so
evident watching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people don't like hearing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I remember and even the the the the
gross ass way that that shit was smoked on
[SPEAKER_02]: those like titanium skillets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiery red.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first earwax.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get some dude, he'd come and get
whatever it was that you were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have him blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and the shit sold for one hundred
dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like gelatinous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like fucking earwax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the days because nobody could
grow pot to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they still needed to move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still needed to make a return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it is really crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, after having closed my store,
my last store in February, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to buy my my cannabis now until I
have a harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks buying that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a source, actually,
and it's not like six star pinkies up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm buying this a gram tub for ninety six
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninety six dollars was at twelve bucks a
gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And twenty bucks after tax out the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the the the the the pot
industry prices are have plummeted,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really glad that that I'm not in it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's but it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can buy I can smoke a gram a day and not
have it really hurt my pocketbook too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I ended up getting that cannabinoid
hyperemesis syndrome from dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you're familiar with
that, but oh, yeah, super bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned my lesson not to,
you know, dab every 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of turned me off to ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I had to go through my own
round of buying my own cannabis because I,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, knocked down the groves and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was throwing up too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't run anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've had friends that have been
unable to smoke and be growers and one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them just is able to smoke again now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
it's it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've gone the 11 months now that I
was told I need to go fully without
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking once, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 fucking months of hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: No edibles, too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nothing cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the amount I was puking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't even worth it to even try.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured I'd do the full 11 months and
not try to skimp on it just in case it
[SPEAKER_01]: pops back up too soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't believe it exists
either until it actually happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you realize, fuck, that shit
sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of the reason a lot of people
don't believe it is that there were that
[SPEAKER_02]: there were doctors that were trying to
hang a lot of shit that wasn't it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people saying,
oh, it's just neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fucking this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fucking this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can get it from the cleanest
source and it doesn't matter if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't smoke it because it gives me
instant inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just not a good experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the flavor of it, but it's just not
a good experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I love the flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was and I was using, you know,
like a Carta or a puff coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Push the button three times, could dab
every 10 minutes, like a crackhead,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cure what else you and then all
of a sudden, you know, eight months later,
you know, it's just not a good experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's the logical end to someone
with addictive personalities, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you always hear cannabis can't kill
you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put this shit to the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, then they ended up in renal
failure and shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me what you're doing now,
dude, since you've closed Harvest House,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have a new business with a similar
name Harvest House, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my space that was my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a little A-frame in Netherlands
and I'm gonna basically make it a format
[SPEAKER_02]: for showcase for cannabis and try to
recruit new home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it the anti-pot store store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Equip people to build their rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they want to become familiar with
living soil or salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide a place for vendors to do pop-ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide a place for breeders to do
pop-ups, glass people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to run a really cannabis
culture-themed session on Saturdays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I get that going, try to find someone
who is interested enough in plant medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and psychedelics that are kosher in
Colorado to use the space on Sundays to
[SPEAKER_02]: give some education and, you know,
maybe share techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not into mushrooms and dealing with
tripping people, so it's not something
[SPEAKER_02]: that I really have an interest in,
but I think that there's a need for
[SPEAKER_02]: education and I have a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're gonna do the Saturdays starting
mid-September and the other thing that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing is I have a hemp license where I am
doing a clone company and providing
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk in or deliver them or ship them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very successful way to do
business right now, even from the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that a lot of seed guys are just
moving over just to clones, so I'm very
[SPEAKER_01]: interested to see how that goes for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with what you got going on with
the education and everything else you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it makes it a lot more fun
if you can choose what you want to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't just have the option of
growing whatever it is that you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have a lot of access these
days, but there's still a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: who feel like they have to gatekeep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not one person that jives with
something that came through my hands and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got some part of me to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never understood the
[SPEAKER_02]: elitism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sour Diesel is a really good example
of everybody's got their story.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've all got the idea of what it is,
how it got named.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that shit, man, I really don't give a
fuck about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have always had access to clones through
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a clone hoarder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been a person who gets tight
with shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been shared with freely and I'll tell
people, don't give it to me if you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want me to, well, and now sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just share it, you know, because I've
given many, many, many, many thousands of
clones away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, not a whole lot of them
have ever come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that how it goes though?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey man, could you fill my room up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could I get a jar or like something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, could I get that clone back?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a sniff.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, CSI gave me great advice a long
time ago and he said, never attach
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself to one clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said for many reasons, cause the second
you let it go, it's no longer yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've attached your name and built
a reputation with it, what are you going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be left with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Always be working towards something else
and keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel like you've got to lock shit
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't attach your ego to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, like it, it sounds easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds really easy, but when you get
something very rare, everybody seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that Gollum syndrome, you know,
and once you, once you learn to get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you get to start moving forward and
creating new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, everybody else is using
your tailing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who gives a shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's not much out there that's
worth much more than anything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, as a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I don't think that people do
value a clone really the way that they
[SPEAKER_02]: should.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a lot of work to,
to, to make a selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of these clones were selected,
you know, two, two seeds popped in a two
[SPEAKER_01]: by four closet and just called elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see, what else do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear your, your take since
you've been on both ends of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: legal versus the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of the pros of the legal
market versus some of the pros of
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional and, and what do you think
will win out in the end for, for guys like
[SPEAKER_01]: us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that there, I think that
there's a, the way we started is not the
[SPEAKER_02]: way it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was an unregulated shop is
operating under medical marijuana rules,
[SPEAKER_02]: which were kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I operated through the, the
promulgation of the earliest rules and
[SPEAKER_02]: withdrew my application for my medical
marijuana shop in 2011 as the regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: took a first regulations took effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in all of that time to right now,
I've never seen advocates win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Advocates have passion and they have
emotion and they have often lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lobbyists win every time.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a, a, a vibrant small business
community where I grew pot and I sold pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's not what everybody else was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had people making edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people making, well, there weren't
really concentrate makers yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: right at that earliest point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the state made everybody become
vertically integrated and that caused
[SPEAKER_02]: people to get into relationships that were
called shotgun marriages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were forced into a business
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had people that were great growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had people that could slinger,
you know, and they were forced together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my early situation where I had a,
a, you might have known him a given no,
[SPEAKER_02]: no good names left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean Lucas.
[SPEAKER_02]: No forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had a early partnership where I
was involved with a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a Denver warehouse that was along with my,
um, uh, my shop in Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, uh, we had a falling out at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a man divorce ended up with a,
uh, restraining order against me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't go get my genetics from the
place and my, I, I didn't lose my company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get fucked over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't allow myself to get fucked over,
but most people didn't end up in a,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a good situation or prevailing after
being in a bad relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that started it all off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you had industry groups,
initially marijuana, medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: industry group, began marijuana industry
group MIG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those people, they write all of it,
you know, and, and so if we fast forward
[SPEAKER_02]: down to today where, you know,
Colorado was, it was very innovative and
[SPEAKER_02]: it had a diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Businesses now the, I am of the opinion
that you have two factions going against
[SPEAKER_02]: each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the hemp based intoxicant market,
and you have the traditional dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people making a shit
ton of money in not THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, and not just like the,
the shady, uh, high THC a trend that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on right now, but the, the latest
changes in the Colorado regulatory scheme,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think really tell it all in cannabis is
a consumer package.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the CPG industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a segment of the CPG industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The C-suite executives that are brought in
to lead these large MSO companies or
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that are getting rolled up and
trying to be something they're coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: the consumer package, good industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, you know, pot is biologically
active.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's shit growing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got yeast and mold on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That isn't dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the potential for things to be
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying that regulations aren't
unnecessary, but I think that the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations are heading in a direction
where the pot that you find in a store is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, however it is that they sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pot has to have a shelf life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't have, you know, when the,
when the, when the terpenes are no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: being produced, they're beaten back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those, those that there's fungal fungus is
the black mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just doing the hydrogen peroxide
dip for the most part on a lot of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're irradiating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are all sorts of shit, you know,
so in large companies, they irradiate it
[SPEAKER_02]: before it ever gets packaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now in Colorado, before you were on it,
you were not allowed to sell prepared
[SPEAKER_02]: food, like potato chips and drinks in your
store that didn't have THC in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't have hemp derived THC in
them either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the new rules allow for you to get
as much as 20% of your revenue from
[SPEAKER_02]: selling popcorn and potato chips and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's in a full move towards a
convenience store model in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, that's the direction that
it's going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would anticipate it going that way
across the country, wherever those CPG
[SPEAKER_02]: companies can get the rules tweaked for
them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the end result is going
to be that we'll be able to buy pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much pot across the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, maybe there'll be
exclusions, but in some states won't drive
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you go to some shit hole market in
Nebraska, you can buy a tomato in the
[SPEAKER_02]: winter time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to New Mexico or California or
Florida, you can buy a tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: The type of tomato that you will be able
to buy is dependent upon how it can be
[SPEAKER_02]: transported and look when it gets to where
you're going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're buying an heirloom tomato
at Whole Foods, there's only certain
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes that can be transported that are
heirloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've turned to mush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that there's going to be store
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think there's going to be good
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think there's going to be
plenty of pot planning cheap pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, fuck, I hear about people spraying
it colors and coating it with THC a now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Jesus, leave it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard about that stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's got turps fucking sprayed on it
and extra isolate, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that means, you know,
what I like is totally irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so but that's the world there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is there's a lot of different types
of market for pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am a firm believer that we're going
to see a homegrown Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're primed for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispensary herb sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best urban dispensary is is way,
way, way overpriced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only a certain type of herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's stuff that can pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biological testing here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stops the biological activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've had stuff that I have jarred
that was so dynamite, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: people want they think they want cured
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want fresh weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get it in the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you see, you see all this
pictures of great looking weed on the hoof
[SPEAKER_02]: in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But someone was just telling me they're
going to send their herb away off site
[SPEAKER_02]: hours away to have it trimmed by who knows
who for 40 bucks a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, what do you what do you
expect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's supposed to be good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope there's a homegrown Renaissance
where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a connoisseur market of any
type.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in Bakersfield, California,
it's few and far between people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be like, I would rather have
better than quantity, quantity that might
[SPEAKER_01]: get me a little high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it seems to be that the whole
attitude is just weed, fucking smoke it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to develop that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it'll take so so much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people getting sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same old shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how how how long does that take to
build in a in a society?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because Colorado has has a history
of good cannabis, but places like
[SPEAKER_01]: shitholes like this, not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, Colorado is a place
where outdoor urban and greenhouse to me
[SPEAKER_02]: is a hard sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're used to indoor pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the dispensaries have have
changed everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it used to be called
Colorado kind, but, you know, that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that's not what we're we're working
with now in general.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the home grower culture,
it was really strong, it boomed,
[SPEAKER_02]: it busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm hearing the people firing up the
room again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember there was a there was a
little bit where you were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: different collectives and showing what you
were getting at different collectives over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that fascinating as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get your take on all these different
strains and what they look like and what
[SPEAKER_01]: to expect from dispensaries when you were
going there, what your money would buy
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure love to savage the sample edibles,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's so many bad ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, there's there's been like
there's been bumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been, you know, like nicotine kind
of pouches.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been jello shots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The jello shot was quite possibly the
nastiest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and they.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's how about the lean,
the T.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: lean that looks like, you know,
purple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scissor, scissor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the scissor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and all the Chads high fived
each other when they left the boardroom
[SPEAKER_02]: and thought that was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got lean weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: The culture is is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not here anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think it's it's I mean,
I haven't visited California in a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but I hear, you know, cultures
pretty, pretty crushed and few people
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging on and.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rosin thing has been really
interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a couple of years ago,
if you would have told me that these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: would have well developed private brands,
you know, I would have been like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you have to have your brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these guys are are doing well
with it and.
[SPEAKER_02]: The you know, the six star hash kind of
contest stuff, that's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: than.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just like to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to talk about it a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pro file.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could still smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long are you going to wait?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I'm ever going to smoke
hash again just because of how bad it
[SPEAKER_01]: triggered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stick with flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just waiting for some good samples to
arrive since I'm nowhere near harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for someone to send me something
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking, you know, I'm going to get
back in if it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six weeks and it's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you want to get in
before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I'd really like to do some
more check ins with you and maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: round tables as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have you as some of the other dudes
talking about different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: different whether it be political or the
clone markets, what have you old strain
[SPEAKER_01]: talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and CSI would be a fucking killer
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, is there anything else you want
to get in for this this round?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good to finally be with you after
trying for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a few years of chasing you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fucking worth it, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, anybody who is looking for
vigorous and healthy clones in Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can actually look at before you
pay for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a holler and you can find me at
Harvest House, Colorado and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it all one word?
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvest underscore house underscore
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put it in the description as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an absolute pleasure having you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an honor.
