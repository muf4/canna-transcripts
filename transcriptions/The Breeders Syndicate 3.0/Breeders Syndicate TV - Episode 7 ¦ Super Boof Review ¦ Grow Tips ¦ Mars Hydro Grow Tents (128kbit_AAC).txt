[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try to recreate this at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to learn some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of this stuff could be fake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of it could be a make believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I real?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know where I'm at right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like I said, warning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn this video off.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got kids in the room, get them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you sick cunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: The String Undocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for a super booth today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do a review on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may or may not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fam?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't even realize you guys were
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You caught me off my game.
[SPEAKER_03]: You caught me off guard a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was just making sure his Mars Hydro
Tent is gonna hold up my weight for my
[SPEAKER_03]: lights and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm close to 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I figure if it can hold me up,
it'll hold up these lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what you saw there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quality control.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: QC, QC.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hanging out with me for a minute on my
little videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all the support and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, drop me a like and
comment on this video.
[SPEAKER_03]: A subscribe would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today we got a couple things to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you saying super booth fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you smoked real weed,
Chuckie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, we gonna get to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I figure why not build up the channel
a little bit on the back of some super
[SPEAKER_03]: booths, permanent markets, things like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we get a nice little
audience built up, we'll drop some good
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like some Kim Dog, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some OG, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Hayes, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some Sours.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on it, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today we're working on some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've been saying, I'm gonna get a
tent set up for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the tent set up, or we're about to
have the tent set up, I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a platform set up, is what I meant
to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been out working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the best thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a little guy on Facebook talking
about how he had some four foot plastic
[SPEAKER_03]: pallets that I was gonna go pick up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the money in hand, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was out recycling cans all weekend
trying to get this money for these little
[SPEAKER_03]: pallets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dude takes a week to write me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time he wrote me back,
I said, Chuck Dog, fam, I gotta go get it,
[SPEAKER_03]: fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta get it after.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be waiting around for you to have
messaged me back on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did some redneck ingenuity out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got ourselves a little dancing
platform, AKA a grow tent platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I wanna talk about today is Super
Booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna do a review.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna build this little tent up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little eight by eight, gonna work on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe do a little montage, or what do you
call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a time, I don't know what you call
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a little thing I work for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm baked, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: A time lapse video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is before I go to edit anything,
so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're gonna build out the tent,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna put the tent down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're gonna work on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're gonna do some trap stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you guys love trap stories for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna do some trap stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna do the Super Booth review.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're gonna work on setting this tent
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some grow tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck, we got the Weed Eater back here,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might even do some Weed Eater tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll work on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tune in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, comment, subscribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Sunday, 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eastern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tune in Friday as well for me and Matt's
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say Matt's show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kinda hang out in there and look
cute.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you wanna know more about strains,
if you wanna know more about strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, history breeder, stuff like that,
people doing real work, go check out
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the laundry list of freaking
shows he's had in the past over the last
[SPEAKER_03]: few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, that's enough about the
people and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna rock out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check out Matt's website as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want some blueberry turps,
I can't say what it is on here,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause YouTube don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're gonna work on the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get jacked up, jacked off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get jiggy with it,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Get real jiggy with that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow tip number one for today is pretty
easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as we're kinda setting up a tent,
we should talk about tents, I feel like,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, chuck dog, I'm gonna be real with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most expensive tent I've ever bought
was an AC Infinity tent, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the better poles.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a better material, I think,
even a thicker material, supposedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the pretty good tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's better tents than that at a higher
price.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice range, but I have no
experience with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if there's some better tents out
there, like gorilla tent, or gorilla grow
[SPEAKER_03]: tents, whatever, all that stuff,
drop them in the comments for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what a good tent is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they make some taller ones that
make different styles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, I like to save a dollar or
two, cause I'm pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty hard on my stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got pets, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep them out of the garden most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep them out of the grow room most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you never know when a little zebra or
a little crocodile or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of thing, come up out of a swamp
out back and get up in the grow tent and
[SPEAKER_03]: mess it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you wanna make sure you're spending
your money wisely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a really clean space,
you don't have to worry about too many
[SPEAKER_03]: problems like mold and animals and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay to get you a better tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't listen to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just Chuck Dog Fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just telling you what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a semi-professional amateur.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just follow along.
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically throw shit at a wall until
something sticks, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we learn as we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, that's life.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't fail in life, you never gonna
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you never gonna fail and grow,
you never really gonna grow, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's why we're here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here to make some wins, get some
losses if we have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know, but we're gonna get
it on the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you got the space, get a better
tent if you want to, but you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that gonna make you a better grower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, is it gonna last
longer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends on how you are,
how hard you are, how many runs you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta plan for that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you're hard on your stuff,
I'd say just go with the cheaper tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mars Hydro makes a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: AC is a little bit better quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're gonna pay a little bit more for
them, especially as you get into the
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're always gonna be more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is an eight by eight from
Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was like with the code and on sale,
I think it was like 260 bucks versus AC
[SPEAKER_03]: Infinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 10 by 10s basically like $450
with the code or 500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do got better poles, but you saving a
buck, you don't give and take a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, at the end of the day, I've been using
Mars Hydro tents basically since I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried Vivio Sun, I've tried AC
Infinity, all of the cheap little brands,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, the Mars Hydro of recent years
have really treated me well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's kind of just what I'll rock
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it works for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially something to think about is if
you're gonna be getting a tent or a brand
[SPEAKER_03]: of tent, make sure you pick the right one
you wanna rock with, because that's your
[SPEAKER_03]: tents kind of fall apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you're hard on your tents like me,
getting jiggy with it up in there in the
[SPEAKER_03]: tents, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Using it like a freaking strip club.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might break your poles, you might lose
a pole.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might rust out on you, shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's cool to have the same brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you can kind of like hodgepodge it
together, take a pole from here or there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as your tent degrades, you can even use
the poles for other stuff to hang your
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds, to dry, to hang another light if
you're just trying to have a veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because sometimes y'all know how
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're here today, because we're
talking about tents, row spaces,
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what I'm trying to get with all
this y'all is you wanna make sure you're
[SPEAKER_03]: planning shit out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't just be free-willing it and
pulling everything out and stroking to
[SPEAKER_03]: everything on eBay and Amazons and
whatever website y'all are using to order
[SPEAKER_03]: your grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you think ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got space, please, for the love of
God, if you're getting into growing,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you got the space, get the biggest tent
you can get, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna save you a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna save you a lot of zippers and
all this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it how you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, God, if I had a room, sealed good
rooms, I'd probably be rocking with rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tents are great, because you can isolate
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really control your environment in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really use them for breeding,
controlling pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tents are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been using four by fours and five
by fives for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And smaller, so I'm kind of burning out on
opening all these little tents and things
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been wanting to switch to bigger
platforms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought maybe I'll switch over to an
eight by eight or a 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go bigger, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make bigger tents out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're like 700 to $2,000 to 3,000,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ain't trying to pay that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of the day, go with whatever
you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll just speak from some of the lower
tier tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all work, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna get buzz from all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tent ain't gonna make you a better
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just gonna make you a better shower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pick whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, like I said, I'd rock with,
if you got the money, get an AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't, get you a little Mars or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even Spider Farmer and Vizio Sun,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got pretty comparable prices and
pretty comparable tents as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Vizio Sun's even got some nice
tents nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I haven't bought any for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from what I looked online,
they look like they're improving a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what y'all rock with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's better brands out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But tell me what they are and tell me what
y'all rock with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what's a good tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one day when Chuck Dog hit the
lottery, fam, up at the gas station,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get me some nice tents.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for right now, I'm gonna rock out with
the Mars Hydros, because they're just kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ain't had no problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I literally got five, six,
seven, four by fours over the last couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of years from them and some five by fives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ain't had no problems with one with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're great all around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, when you're
starting off growing, you really want to
[SPEAKER_03]: plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get you a big space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was saying before, if you've got the
space, get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because number one problem growing,
sorry, my nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one problem with growing,
fam, is you never have enough space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why even waste the time buying four
inch fans and fucking four inch inlines
[SPEAKER_03]: and all this shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can afford it and you've got the
space, go with something a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, you just always got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always get other little tents and
shit, but try to maximize your space.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, do what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna get to rocking on putting
this tent together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop me some comments and stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna be bouncing around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we're gonna be doing this
little review here in just a second or
[SPEAKER_03]: two, or maybe we've already done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, maybe we'll put it after this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good intro, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna try.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate all the likes, the comments,
the support.
[SPEAKER_03]: To all the couple little haters out there,
I appreciate y'all taking the time out of
[SPEAKER_03]: y 'all life to watch Shug Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though you hate me and shit,
you take your time out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate everybody else too that rock
with me, that takes time out of your day,
[SPEAKER_03]: your life to check out a little video by
Matt or myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really doesn't mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna rock out, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna bring people together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get some positivity,
but we're also gonna have some fun doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we ain't gonna take no shit while
we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fam, I appreciate y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, Michigan and everybody else out
there in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all know I'm rocking out with y'all down
in Australia as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: My cat's meowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna jump around and get to this
review.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to the stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing it for Kim, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, to be Chuck Dog, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lifestyle, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ain't nobody gonna stop me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going straight to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on my janitor shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all go get the mop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing my pushups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting all this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning everything I need to learn,
fam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going in for you guys, hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going in for my motherfucking self.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do this shit together, fam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you thought I forgot about you
organic bros out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell nah, we doing some fermentation and
getting some brewing going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check this out straight from the penis.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the frame all set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the roof pieces on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't really a how-to video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of me setting stuff up so you
guys can kind of fall along like I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: saying in this whole damn time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and I gotta be, I gotta make
my shit clear because I thought these
[SPEAKER_03]: poles were gonna be thicker, fam,
but they ain't, they're the same as the
[SPEAKER_03]: normal ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I must've got them mixed up with video
sons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of them companies got a little
bit thicker of a pole, but I know AC
[SPEAKER_03]: Infinity does, but I thought these were
gonna be the thick ones, but they're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's fine, because we got
replacements.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our four by fours and five by fives
on the same little system or platform,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you wanna call it, same size
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we can kind of hodgepodge
like we were saying earlier, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it looks pretty good, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a lot more space than your boys
used to in just one little given area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we gonna fit on the platform just
right, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta clean up in here a little bit and
then we gonna rock out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, growing tips wise for the day,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I had to give you a good
growing tip, is never think, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get set in your ways, because you
can always learn something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is there something new you
learned recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, let me know in the comment section,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to learn everything I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not very smart man, but I do know what
good weed is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm trying to work on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gonna get this channel popping,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I got video cameras and stuff
on the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Amazon's super slow, you know what I'm
saying, Jay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to start trying to do some pull
ups on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I kinda wanna see if I wanna hang on
this sucker for real, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I better not though.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said it was like, I forget how much
weight, but I don't know, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: But another thing too is you get mixed up,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you save a little grow booklet
that they send with you with the tent and
[SPEAKER_03]: then you go in the back, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the last page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just follow this little diagram
here, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never set one of these up, so it got me
a little screwed up here in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really set one up that has a
middle pole like this, but it is what it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm cool with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll give me something to hang my shit
from, you know what I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: fam?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if my fucking grow don't go that good,
maybe I can put myself up there like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better not say too much on YouTube,
I'll get screwed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, YouTube don't like us very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, I think it's gonna be cool,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: What y'all think?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, do some thinking here and I'm
gonna put this cover on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Putting the final touches on it,
just zipping her up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it by myself just to prove you can do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got her done, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the eight by eight up, ready,
rock, cock, strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even left a few glory hole ports open to
accommodate Denali, because I know he's
[SPEAKER_03]: giant and his penis, I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got her all set up, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little tip or advice, leave the ceiling
pieces off till the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to stick those back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also make sure you get all your zippers
undone on this thing before you try to put
[SPEAKER_03]: it on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hella confusing by yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if Chuck Dogg can do it by himself,
you guys can do it by myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will need a little bit of upper body
strength, so if you got any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: medical issues or disabilities,
you're probably gonna need some help on
[SPEAKER_03]: this one for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, we're pretty much
ready to rock, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got her done, got her up, ready to
rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just gotta get the lights in here,
all that shit, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoo!
[SPEAKER_03]: We poppin', poppin', poppin' our shit,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: This shit's fuckin' cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that, man, we just runnin' around
in that bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woof, woof, woof, sheep, sheep,
sheep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that, boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can live in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might just have to start doin' a little
podcast in here, bro, god damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, let's jump over to another little
segment, and we'll keep rockin'.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll come back on this one on the next
episode, and we'll put the lights and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff up like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanna kinda put the tent together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your environment's gonna be your
most important thing, so make sure you get
[SPEAKER_03]: it right the first time so you don't gotta
fuck with it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And always get bigger than you can,
you know, maybe not afford, but just get
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger than you can, so imagine that
you're gonna go, because you're always
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna need more space when you're tryin'
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you sick cunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me, Chuck, the String-a-Dot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're lookin' for a super booth today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do a review on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may or may not like that, but it is
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: What up, fam?
[SPEAKER_03]: Got some super booth with me?
[SPEAKER_03]: About to try it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna roll somethin' up of it real
quick, see if we like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a pretty popular string
here in Michigan, at least the part that I
[SPEAKER_03]: am in right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some people say it's not that
big of a deal anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it is, what it is, all I'm
sayin', it's pretty popular in the stores
[SPEAKER_03]: that I go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I figured I'd pick somethin' up and
check it out today with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're waitin' on Harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you guys wanna see somethin' other
than these wreck weeds and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're workin' on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're workin' on it, trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some stuff in the works.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like to do some of these
string reviews with the co-hosts or
[SPEAKER_03]: somethin' like that, where we both can try
it out together and kinda, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: have a conversation about the string and
kinda go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, it kinda sucks just havin'
one person, especially when you guys can't
[SPEAKER_03]: really enjoy it with me or hate it with
me, I guess I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be kinda cool to have somebody to
have a conversation about with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're goin' playin' on that here soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're workin' on a harvest and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got the grow tent set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, we're about to rock out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about to do some grow videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're workin' on sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're workin' on all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so tune in, like, subscribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today we're goin' jump into Super
Booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote it down this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Black cherry punch times Tropicana
cookies, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's the actual cross or
whatever, the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please tell me in the comment section
down below if I got it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can get it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a modern genetic dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know a lot about modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just moved to Michigan about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just tryin' stuff out, checkin' out
the market, doin' different stuff while
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waitin' on a harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But today, like I said, we got the Super
Booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gon' crack it open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people I've seen in the Discord,
they don't like Super Booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say that sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like citrus turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like Super Booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff's poo poo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather have permanent markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, we gon' crack this
open and see what we get from it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another cookies cross, so not too much to
be expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: This reminds me of, I don't know if you
guys have ever grown forbidden fruit punch
[SPEAKER_03]: from CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the homies from the Discord's grown
that out and I got to take some home and
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke on it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And got to smoke on it for a few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells damn near like that,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of citrusy, cherry, kind of tropical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, yeah, citrusy, lemon kind of smell,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not real a bunch of either or,
just light kind of smells, but real
[SPEAKER_03]: refreshing kind of smellin', bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a high C or something like that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the nugs are concerned,
I can't show them off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on that, y'all, for doing
something on a different channel or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get us in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, as far as the nugs,
real nice, not super dense nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real frosty, got little specks of purples
and stuff in the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole lot, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: And smells pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try some out real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm jumping off camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta roll something up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I should probably have them already
rolled up, but I like rolling up with you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we kickin' in the garage or
something, or in the grow tent,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate all you guys stopping in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comment, like, and subscribe and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: While I got you here, go check out The
Goat Farm, aka Pac Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, go pick up a hat if you need
a hat, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Pac.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look real good, and I look real good in
these hats, just sayin'.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go pick up some Pac merch.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're rolling this up, I figure I
might as well go ahead and tell y'all a
[SPEAKER_03]: little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're working on the AC Infinity and a
couple other sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here pretty soon you're probably going
to see like codes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try not to flood you guys
out with, you know, like the little codes,
[SPEAKER_03]: discount codes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we get demonetized every time we're
turning around and we're getting screwed
[SPEAKER_03]: with by YouTube and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's probably the route that we're
going to be taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Matt's going to put me in charge
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And me and Matt are going to go hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we land the AC Infinity
sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't, we don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: A partnership, should I say.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will have a little Mars code for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 3% off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the down in the bottom of the
video, there's going to be an affiliate
[SPEAKER_03]: code for Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys buy some stuff from Mars
Hydro, me and Matt get 5%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go ahead and click that little link
down there and I'll get you where you need
[SPEAKER_03]: to go if you're buying something from
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, we're working on the AC
Infinity one and then we're going to work
[SPEAKER_03]: on some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to get some, get your, if there's
anybody out there who wants to sponsor a
[SPEAKER_03]: homie with some nutrients, let's get it
popping fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, let's get back to the
super booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to give you a quick little
update.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let y'all know that I'm rocking out for y
'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to get stuff going.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to improve the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to improve the channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to improve y'all's
entertainment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to improve everything about
the show, make it more fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said from day one, I'm not here to
take over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here just to have some fun and really
boost the channel and just contribute the
[SPEAKER_03]: best way that I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the best way I know how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the super booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the genetics are correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, who the fuck am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a dude that likes to grow weed
and get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I say is you need to take with
a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just telling y'all what I'm going
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling y'all what I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling y'all my failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of the day, don't take my
advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go out there and do your own research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go out there and grind it out yourself and
figure everything out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, the forbidden fruit
punch pretty close to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you ever smoked that, pretty much
the same deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the dudes in the Discord got a
really nice expression of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much tastes just like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say the structure is obviously
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it smells and tastes just like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a real refreshing weed when you
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, if you're a real time,
big time toker, I don't know if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get super ripped off this all the
time, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do enjoy some good flavor,
or if you enjoy that kind of citrusy kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of tropical-y vibe, this is probably going
to be for you, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's like 20 bucks for the
eighth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big eighth guy, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to try and stuff out for
you guys on the channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remind you like some Sunny D or High C or
something, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, if you don't smoke that often,
this will probably rip your head off.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you smoke like once a day or something,
I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke pretty much all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take that with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: This might rip your head off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying this is bunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a pretty decent high on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's probably not for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more of an OG Kim sour kind of dude,
you know, Bubba Kush, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like some funky raunchy turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all know me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want something that smells like tuna,
tuna fish, some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want something that smells freaking
funky, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rotten, savory, meaty, oniony,
garlicky, sulfury, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want some funky bunky in the booty
hole type shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all right, though, for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all gonna hate me for saying this,
but I'd rather have this than the
[SPEAKER_03]: permanent marker I had last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people like permanent marker,
but I mean, for me, permanent marker is
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of boring, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor is kind of predictable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the sherbert flavor,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never really been for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would actually, you know, if I had to
choose between the two, which one I would
[SPEAKER_03]: take just to smoke like once or twice a
week or something, I'd probably gonna take
[SPEAKER_03]: the super boob.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think most people out there would
probably take the permanent marker,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think I like this just because it's
different from shit I normally grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is nice to smoke every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do have a cut floating around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do sell cuts of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never buy a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care to have a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if somebody was gonna give me
one or something, maybe I'd take one in,
[SPEAKER_03]: but probably not for real, fam,
just because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to pay for some cuts,
especially some modern stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is cool to check out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, flavor, I'd give it a fucking
seven out of 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell, I'd give it a seven out of 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: High, I'd probably give it like a six out
of 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if you like citrusy orange
weed, I wouldn't say this is like oranges,
[SPEAKER_03]: like citrusy is like maybe like
clementines or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does to me have that, you know,
everybody tastes weed and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: differently, especially smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cigarettes, especially how you smoking the
weed itself, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I mean, I probably would pick up
a pack of these or a cross or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I care about the cut so
much, but trying to find something like
[SPEAKER_03]: this to maybe work into a cross or
something is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I've never been a big tangy
guy or big crocky genetics kind of person
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't really, I do have some
of the genetics and things like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't, I'm not like a big fan or
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have gotten free packs and or
whatever over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, that being said,
the SuperBoo is kind of all right for real
[SPEAKER_03]: fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let's be some good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you come up here and you ain't been
smoking, you ain't trying to get super
[SPEAKER_03]: ripped.
[SPEAKER_03]: You try and go out and smoke some weed on
the lake and do some fishing and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like this or, you know, some chick weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your wife, she wants to smoke,
but no one gets super ripped off with some
[SPEAKER_03]: flavorful shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see like, my old lady really
liking this kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, man, it's not even bad for the
price point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it cured pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say what brand it is and
stuff like that because I'm not really
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to put people on like that unless
they're going to be cutting us a check or
[SPEAKER_03]: something, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and Matt got to get paid or get some
kind of sponsorship or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: fam, because we're putting a lot of work
into this and we can't ever get any kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of revenue, ad monetization or anything
like that just because we're making weed
[SPEAKER_03]: content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to try to implement some
codes and stuff like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and try to show off some products,
do some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to mainly do that on my own
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to incorporate that into
the main show so much so we can keep that
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of pure and focused on history and
breeding and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, if you want some
orangey kind of citrusy tropical vibes and
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't want to buy no fucking permanent
markers, maybe try the Super Boof.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say it's the best thing in the
world or nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you haven't had some kind of
like forbidden fruit punch or something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, it would be cool to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, if you're a grower and
not a shower and you want to maybe grow
[SPEAKER_03]: something out of this similar to this,
I would definitely probably go to CSI and
[SPEAKER_03]: see what Caleb's got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know he's got like the forbidden
fruit punch and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably get you pretty close to this for
real, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, if you don't want to go to
that hype market way or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're not into buying wrecked weed,
you can go and pop some seeds and probably
[SPEAKER_03]: find something pretty similar to,
you know, maybe not structure wise,
[SPEAKER_03]: but flavor and smells and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get right on the money with that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, some good shit,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably smoke it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to chase her down or nothing
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to get hate in the comments,
but I definitely would take this over the
[SPEAKER_03]: permanent marker we smoked last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like Super Boof, if you've tried it
before, let me know down in the comments
[SPEAKER_03]: section below.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's weed eater tips going to be kind
of simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really talk about this on the
last video.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I probably should.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see here with my little weeder,
fam, we ain't got no guard on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some of y'all saying, Chug Dog,
you saying last video, you threw rocks and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff through the window and stuff like
that, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's why I was meaning by walking
left.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way you throw them right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can kind of guess and kind of aim
where you're throwing your debris and
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I forgot to mention, if you got a
little guard on here, take that bull crap
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to make your weed eater
lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of for sissies anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't really need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're walking the right way,
and we talked about this on the last
[SPEAKER_03]: video, we're always going to walk left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you ain't ever going to walk right.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're going, say, you're looking at
a house, you're always going to walk left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, I'll show you what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was going to weed eat this box right
here and I wanted to do it the right way,
[SPEAKER_03]: fam, we fired this son of a bitch up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, we approach it from any
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like to really kind of start where
I'm going to start and end where I can
[SPEAKER_03]: most efficiently and easily jump to the
next thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I was here and I'm going this way,
I'd probably start there and then rock
[SPEAKER_03]: out, come around right there, and then
rock out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the sake of the demonstration,
we're going to come in like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either walk kind of sideways like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really like to kind of get that
angle on there, fam, like you at the strip
[SPEAKER_03]: club.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving a straight pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just freaking bust now like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're walking backwards, walking
backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're running backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, yeah, fam, that's all you got
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it seems weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems weird, and it's awkward at first.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me tell you, it'll give you a lot
of strength in your calves for pounding
[SPEAKER_03]: out your wife or husbands or whatever it
is late at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might need that shit sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leg strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of people go skip leg day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get your leg strength up,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, you don't need that freaking
guard on there, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing I should say about that
guard is when you got that guard on there,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got a little, usually like a little
blade on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll keep your string from getting a
certain length.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're in like some real tall shit
or maybe you ain't ever really mowed this
[SPEAKER_03]: yard before, and they just want you to
clean it up once or twice a year or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got some big shit you're going
through, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can get a disc cutter and shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, that shit is dangerous if
you got a bunch of freaking people on
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs and stuff around you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually when I'm rocking that with
three, four guys, we just hit it up with a
[SPEAKER_03]: Wheatier, get some thicker string.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, me and the guys get into it all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's people on the internet
that'll show little videos at like super
[SPEAKER_03]: slow speeds, tell you the best kind of
string for your trimmers and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all technique, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could take a pair of scissors and cut
your grass, you know, like you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that don't really matter to me much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, you know,
if you don't have that guard on there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get your string longer,
fam, which means you can cut more grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really, you know, you can really
take advantage of not having that on
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you look like a badass doing it,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two, you're cutting your string off
too with that little that blade on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you actually bump your head,
if you actually bump that head on the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground, you're cutting your string off
your waist and string too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen guys, even without that,
I've seen guys take a whole brand new roll
[SPEAKER_03]: of string, fam, and run that mug out
edging and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we always talk about edging,
fam, but I'm talking about edging like
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to do some edging and
stuff when it warms up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grass ain't really started to grow yet,
but we're going to do some here soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do some mowing tips,
some blowing tips, some leaf cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got all kinds of tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: We give them, we give them tips out left
and right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but if you like the weeder tips,
if you like the mowing stuff like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, we're talking about this kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know if you, if it don't make much
sense to you, let me know that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I figure, you know, we, we all
outside rocking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well talk about some fucking who
doesn't like mowing equipment,
[SPEAKER_03]: fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know it's the last, last video.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys with the electric one is a little
bit weird, but you know, if you got a
[SPEAKER_03]: weeder and you like doing it, it is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't judge, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out here rocking with the Shendawa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really judge or say much,
but you know, I would like to see you by
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the season with the,
you know, a proper, some kind of weeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't an electric battery powered bull,
but it is what it is, fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're going to, we're going to jump
around a little bit, like I was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably going to jump over into some
trap stories right here real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And go from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'd be it for today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you take them guards off your
weeders, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless the only time I would ever
recommend having that guard on there is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you really paranoid about
throwing some stuff and you suck all
[SPEAKER_03]: around at weeding or you're in a real
tight spot, maybe, or, or maybe,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's a lot of windows,
residential areas, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can help you, I guess, to a certain
degree with that, but that being said,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I mean, if you, I mean, if you like
me out in the country, bro, and you need
[SPEAKER_03]: some, you need to haul ass and cut grass,
you take that freaking guard off there,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all doggone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you let that, you let your neighbors
know how much of a B.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they drive by and they don't see no
cover on your weeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just out there listening to
freaking ACDC or whatever you got,
[SPEAKER_03]: freaking Backstreet Boys just,
just freaking pump and slaying grass and
[SPEAKER_03]: slaying ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the kind of shit I'm into,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing good weed, cutting grass,
and getting, getting ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, trapping, trap stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we all being messing with them
dirty little dab hoes, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: tell y'all a little trap story about how a
dab hoe probably saved me from going to
[SPEAKER_03]: jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So salute to you guys and gals out there,
holding it down, ratchet style,
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing that pee back for us,
twerking on a D for me, for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, growing up, I didn't really have
a crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really have a whole lot of
partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one time I did have a partner,
he ended up helping, not, he didn't help,
[SPEAKER_03]: but basically because of having a partner,
people find out where I was, stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was back hustling as a kid and I
got robbed at gunpoint, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: took my L, the one L I had in life,
took the L and came back cock strong,
[SPEAKER_03]: learned lessons, batting down the hashes
and prepared for battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, after that, you know,
I was always on my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times I was carrying a weapon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't say what, just cause it's
YouTube, but a lot of times I was carrying
[SPEAKER_03]: a weapon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time I had a lot of success in my
little town, making good money,
[SPEAKER_03]: selling a really high grade bud for our
area in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously over time I got some haters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of my competition in my town were
going through the two main plugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: which were a lot of bunk weed,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll just keep it at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a bunch, they had a bunch of
connections.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a bunch of weight, but a lot of
the weed kind of sucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time they were calling it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was selling shit, 20 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, the shit that they had was
probably like not even worth 10 a gram,
[SPEAKER_03]: but your boy has some good smoke and they
were little haters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways, I'm messing with this dab
hoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: She basically a glorified stripper type
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, she was telling me like,
cause you know how people are,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your customers, they gonna buy weed from
whoever, you know, you had good customers
[SPEAKER_03]: that buy weed from you, your loyal ones,
but then you had them ones that getting a
[SPEAKER_03]: gram or half quarter or whatever,
you know, they're, they're hopping around
[SPEAKER_03]: on whoever's around or closest or most
convenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna hit them up first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So naturally I'm, I'm hanging out with a
girl that I'm smashing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she tells me like, Hey, you know,
this crew, I know who these people are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matter of fact, we'll go into deeper dive
into some of the stories with this other
[SPEAKER_03]: crew, but this crew years before when
Reggie was a thing had blocked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically they had really great Reggie
through some cartel shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know, but they had really
good Reggie at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hadn't gotten a few QPs and stuff
like that from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was doing my little flippy flippy
thing, you know, and basically I was going
[SPEAKER_03]: through a middle man that was going
through them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they find out, I was going
through their middle man to get their
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like cut me off and they,
if they, they sold a few more bags to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're real dog shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually they just cut me off
altogether because they were little
[SPEAKER_03]: haters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So years later, when I have switched up
and your boy got a good plug and we got
[SPEAKER_03]: some good smoke, uh, you know,
naturally they wanted to fuck with me,
[SPEAKER_03]: not like in a negative way, but they
wanted to make money with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, I had to say no,
cause you guys done blocked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the first time, uh, when I needed it,
it helped.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why the fuck am I going to help you
guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So naturally this, they didn't like that
too much because they, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: anyways, time goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm messing with this girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, she tells me one day,
Hey, I went over to such and such his
[SPEAKER_03]: house is where this other crew usually
hung out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the story on the street was this
dude's a little rat and, uh, working with
[SPEAKER_03]: the police cause he got raided all the
stuff and none of his stuff got taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was still in business.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went to jail for like a night and was
out the next night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up meeting this guy like two or
three times in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go into that more as we go on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was like the leader.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say, let's call them Lance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Lance Bass, uh, red hair, ginger pale
demon of a skinny twig, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've ever seen your life a little hater,
you know, anyway, so come to find out he's
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get with this girl that I'm
messing around with, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a girl tells me, and she's telling
me like, Hey, you know, every time I go
[SPEAKER_03]: over and try to get a bag from them,
they're out always asking about you and
[SPEAKER_03]: asking about your whereabouts and what
you're doing and who your people are and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always like asking about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Oh, they are for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I naturally, I know, cause this
girl telling me, give me the insight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know these fuckers are out trying to get
me and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do sell to some of, see like this
Lance Bass, he's got his little,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, middleman and people, you know,
everybody's got, you know, the main plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always got a little middleman and then
under that they got people eating off of
[SPEAKER_03]: them and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like their whole, they had like a whole
crew and a whole setup and a little,
[SPEAKER_03]: little, little dudes under him and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them dudes I was selling to
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So come to find out though, some of them
guys were going back and telling them,
[SPEAKER_03]: do my business and showing the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm kind of sketched out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I had already had altercations with,
uh, you know, previously before a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm on my PDNQ's fam, uh, you know,
walking around with protection,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anytime I have no condoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm ready for my shit.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so we'll go, how'd I,
there's so many things to this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of his, this dude's little
lieutenant guys, whatever you call them,
[SPEAKER_03]: little fucking middleman dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a little dweeb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we'll call him, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll call him, uh, John, whatever John's
him and his little girlfriend or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always run around together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, basically he's trying to make
money and he's trying to go through me and
[SPEAKER_03]: he's trying and he goes through the Lance
Bass already.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't know all of this,
but I come to come to find out later.
[SPEAKER_03]: At first everything's all cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's one of them dudes that every time
he gets in the fucking whip with you and
[SPEAKER_03]: meets up with you wherever he's like,
you know, why don't you knock off 20 for
[SPEAKER_03]: me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Da da da.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you knock off a little bit for
me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking, you know, so annoying,
bro, the price of the price.
[SPEAKER_03]: This ain't like negotiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's already annoying me with this
dude anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get to a point where I finally just
lose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I had so much other, uh,
business and customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really fucking need his ass
anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was already given like a discount
cause he's getting a bulk bulk bulk amount
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, bro, I'm already hooking you
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm not making money really here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making fucking nothing basically by
the time you, what you want me to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't do that with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So naturally he's talking shit to Lance
Bass, his daddy, uh, whenever,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, whenever he goes and hangs
out with them and they have parties and
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, all right, so these cats,
I feel like these cats trying out to get
[SPEAKER_03]: me somehow some way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the kicker is, is I'm living with one
of the old like middlemen and I'm sharing
[SPEAKER_03]: a room with this dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just crashing in a, renting a room
from his dude for a while and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: friends, but they, they're, they used to
be friends, but the Lance Bass screwed my
[SPEAKER_03]: roommate over and hadn't talked for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways, they start up their
friendship again, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, little buddies trying to figure
out all my shit, try and get in,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, trying to, trying to get close
to me, uh, Lance Bass trying to get close
[SPEAKER_03]: to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's, he's making connections.
[SPEAKER_03]: With my roommate again, and, you know,
giving them weed and like getting in close
[SPEAKER_03]: with them and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sitting here like these fuckers are
trying to do something.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, John, me and him, we finally just
had our, we got to go different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I told him, I was like, dude,
you can't keep fucking asking me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he kind of got smart about,
you know, not giving him discounts and all
[SPEAKER_03]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally I was just like, look,
dude, we can't really do business anymore
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: He kept texting me and said, be like,
come on, man, if you want to work out,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's work it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways, like a month ago was about
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know this guy's car, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've seen them before I met up with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know which car you drive, you drive a
real, uh, uh, easy to identify,
[SPEAKER_03]: identify car.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see it from coming a mile away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyways, I'm going out to the flea
market, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: One day there's a smoke shop in there and
to get, uh, get like stuff for smoking,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a pipe or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight stretch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 20 minutes away from my,
where I live.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to go from my town to another
town to get to this flea market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like a month after all this
other shit's been going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was weird shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old girls telling me that they're like
asking about me and wondering what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: doing and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to the flea market,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm in the Monte Carlo and I'm going
across this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like halfway there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going across a straight stretch.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about like a half mile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quarter mile long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes into two lanes for just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're out in the country and that way
somebody can pass you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me get a drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: My freaking throat's going dry,
fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so I'm driving out to flea market,
going down the straight stretch and I'm in
[SPEAKER_03]: an old like 98 Monte Carlo fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, and that was never a big speeder,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always going to speed limits,
especially when I'm doing, doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going 55.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for like a mile behind me,
you could see I'm pretty straight.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look, I'm always looking at my rear
view mirror.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always looking around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always watching, you know,
watching from my surroundings and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kid you not do from like half mile
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look in the rear view mirror and what do
I see?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the front end of old John's car
coming down through there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget what it was like a Dodge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted a challenger or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dodge Charger or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a challenger, not a charger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but I could recognize his car cause
it's an old Navy blue or like a old Navy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like Navy blue, uh, Navy blue color,
that dark ugly blues you see sometimes on
[SPEAKER_03]: cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can just tell I worked in auto
mechanic industry for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, I know what cars look
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could recognize it's him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only the only car that color in the
whole town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know John's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's hauling ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I'm like this motherfucker,
what's he doing in my mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at the time I'm listening to
fucking, uh, you know, some pretty sketchy
[SPEAKER_03]: music thinking I'm too pock or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking like, damn dude,
this guy, he's coming to either fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: shoot me bro, or he's coming to do
something to me or fuck with me somehow,
[SPEAKER_03]: run me off a road, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just gun it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start gunning it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, we're coming up his two,
two lane, uh, deal and, uh, like where the
[SPEAKER_03]: road splits and you could pass somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking to myself, like,
all right, bro, like what the hell are we
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do here?
[SPEAKER_03]: So didn't have the strap on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, nothing, uh, nothing I could really
do other than just try to protect myself
[SPEAKER_03]: or get out of the way, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know, I don't know what's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he gets, he's coming fast as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where I basically, soon as I hit the
two lane split, John's on my ass,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro up on my ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honking his horn, doing all this shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just stay in the main lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cause I'm not, I'm not going to try to
move over into the lanes and then him
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking accidentally hit me or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just staying in that main lane and
my windows are tinted as fuck,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I'm sitting low in the Monte
Carlo, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing it cool with everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, this motherfucker, he tries to go
around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing all, doing all this like
halfway through this fucking, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: two lane deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, he's swerving around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he, he goes around me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this shit's pissing me off,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm like, dude, he's fucking with
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, this is damn near.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, he could kill, kill somebody or
me or somebody coming out of the way,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just like, made that decision in
that moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, fuck him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He ain't passing my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am done fucking around, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just gunned it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's, he's coming around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's trying to pass me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm still in that main lane and I'm
gunning it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're fucking running out of,
uh, two lanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to eventually come back to a
one lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then basically you're in town and
there's the flea market and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, usually there's police posts up
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's like that they have a lot of
tax money and shit in that town.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically, there's just a lot of
police presence right there, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: right as you come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it goes from 55 to like 35 speed
limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, they're always posted up
hiding right there in this parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking to myself like,
fuck, like I got to slow down or what we
[SPEAKER_03]: got to do something here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the shit's shit's all coming to a
head and getting to this boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oiling point, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The dude, he back to dude, he's trying to
pass me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's in a more modern car.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my 98 Monte Carlo was a six cylinder,
but, uh, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so it wasn't like souped up or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This car's a little bit newer,
but I'm gunning it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it floored and he's trying to pass
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got it floored, but my car is keeping
up with his growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're neck and neck, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like we're coming out to, to where
they're both lanes are about to end,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm flooring it with everything I got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so is he, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his car finally, he's taking me,
uh, overtaking me just cause he got a
[SPEAKER_03]: newer car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, he's, as he's coming,
he comes over and his fucking wheels,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro, as that road ends, his back wheels,
I'll watch as they hit like the grass as
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes off in his back and goes like,
yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he bounces, you know, and he,
uh, slams on his brakes real quick to try
[SPEAKER_03]: to get me to run into him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But bro, like I said, I'm on my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready to kill this guy, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, with love, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so I slam on my brakes and,
uh, and I'm ready, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy getting out of a car,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put my shit in them park,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, he just takes off real fast and
fucking floors it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's fucking idiot, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sitting there thinking like you
lucky, dude, cause this could've ended
[SPEAKER_03]: really bad, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, uh, so I go to the flea market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go to the fucking, uh, little weed
shop in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got like, uh, beads coming down in
front.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like black lights inside and
everything's pretty cool, cool spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I go in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this motherfucker and his girlfriend
are there at the cash register,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he don't see me.
[SPEAKER_03]: She don't see me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of dark in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's police all over this fucking
flea market just cause of a shit ton of
[SPEAKER_03]: people in there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking like, I can stick this guy
right here, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fucking just take off running.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, man, I'm trying to,
I'm just trying to chew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go home today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't had no problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like fuck this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I'll, I'll do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get him back some way or form or
however, whatever, you know, I'll kiss his
[SPEAKER_03]: girlfriend when he ain't looking some shit
like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, I'm thinking, what can I do
though?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck with this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I literally, bro, as I'm walking to
like the cash register, he's on the left
[SPEAKER_03]: of the counter talking to one of the
employees and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the employee turns around and it's on
walking by, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just take my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I did this, but I took my
thumb and I bring it around in the front
[SPEAKER_03]: of his neck, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just go real lightly across his
throat as I walked by.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't say nothing, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he didn't say nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look, I look back and he looked at
me, bro, and like didn't say nothing,
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't do nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sat there like a little, you know,
a little bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I bought my pipe and shit and
they left, I left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really like the end of the
story for that guy in particular.
