[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeder Cynicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine scene, researching everything
from cannabis strain history, old
[SPEAKER_03]: smuggling tales from the first-person
perspective, to breeding science and news
[SPEAKER_03]: on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_03]: Natsodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_03]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeder Cynicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, here with my co-host
Thousandfold, and today we are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we are continuing our series of
breeding, and I'd like to thank Kwazia for
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be going over some of the
building blocks of modern cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the plants and lines that still
feature in much of modern work today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over each of these and
talk about how they will breed and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they work in breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all I had to say there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is an easy one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've covered it briefly in another
episode, but I wanted to go more in depth
[SPEAKER_03]: and more in detail on a few of them,
because I think it definitely needs to be
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, without further ado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we'll first launch into some of
the golden generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hay's skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights, poison, Afghani number
one, blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can start with Hay's, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for Hay's, being one of the main
baselines, a lot of Dutch still to this
[SPEAKER_03]: day use Hay's as one of their main
baselines that's in most everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it was Hay's crossed the skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as the Dutch and Neville and all of
them were over there developing these
[SPEAKER_03]: lines, Sam the Skunk Man in America,
according to history, or as it's told,
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob Clark, obviously, was a part of
that, as we learn later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The development of things like Hay's and
Skunk One took place in California
[SPEAKER_03]: originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't Dutch specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when Sam the Skunk Man went over to
Amsterdam, he took a few of these lines
[SPEAKER_03]: with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they worked so well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things like Skunk One had a very
specific structure that bred well into
[SPEAKER_03]: other lines, whereas things like Hay's,
supposedly, trying to find these versions
[SPEAKER_03]: of Hay's, I haven't quite experienced yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But supposedly, they had the ultimate
high, according to Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the work done over in
Amsterdam was to try to capture that Hay's
[SPEAKER_03]: high in a faster, better structured,
more resinous form, essentially an easier
[SPEAKER_03]: growing form for indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hay's is one of the baselines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is debate about what is in Hay's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like some of what Sam gave to
Neville and whoever else ended up with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's some quotes from others
saying they got Hay's from Sam,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sounds like some of these different
batches were different versions worked by
[SPEAKER_03]: this whatever group was in Santa Cruz
making the Hay's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some had Indian in it later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some had Thai.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sounds like what we're seeing is
mostly a combination of Colombian gold,
[SPEAKER_03]: things like Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a maybe Thai in there from the
original stuff being combined.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those took it a lot of different
directions and obviously were very long
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering, since there was no addition of
Afghani at that point in any of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it itself was a work line from,
the history says Santa Cruz, so I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to go with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it is constructed of what I
would also consider older baselines.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not baselines that I can fully
speak on, since I wasn't really alive when
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombians got Colombian gold,
Panama red, Acapulco gold, any of those
[SPEAKER_03]: Zacatecas purple, any of those were around
being smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really comment on those fully.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do know that the basis for things
like skunk one as well were Acapulco gold
[SPEAKER_03]: and Colombian gold with some Afghani,
according to Sam the skunk fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while the baselines, we were talking
about baselines, I did want to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: quick nod to the baselines that existed
before the lines that we commonly use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because technically, people could take it
back to the Acapulco gold and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombian gold and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But realistically, what we are working
with today are modern versions of things
[SPEAKER_03]: like the haze, the skunk one, the northern
lights, one, two, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is also the kind of limit of
roughly the limits of what we know as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back further, we just don't have
that information.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard with information going
back further.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to allude to calling them
stories or whatever, because we have
[SPEAKER_03]: really one man's perspective of skunk one,
how it was created, who created it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and when.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just one man's take on it,
one man's story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not to call any of that into question,
but that's what we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I'm repeating.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't necessarily make it a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm sure there are other people
involved with different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I definitely don't want to ignore
that, because things change over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if one of these guys comes out and
speaks and is very legit?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to nail this into stone
necessarily on who brought what,
[SPEAKER_03]: where, at what time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do know that Sam did bring the haze
and the skunk one over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do know that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: But who was involved with making these and
what their makeup was?
[SPEAKER_03]: We are taking that from a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think haze in particular,
out of this whole list, is probably our
[SPEAKER_00]: broadest term in the sense of it's hard to
point at particular lines or particular
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and say that definitely represents
all of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a lot of fragmentation there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to refer to haze as a single line
to me is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incorrect.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go back and look at the history,
it seems like it was several lines that
[SPEAKER_03]: were made by a specific group or worked by
a specific group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that case, one is a hybrid of the
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you call it the same name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be the same line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be very different from the last
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But during that time, there wasn't all the
name game.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't all the marketing involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Though the Haze brothers and the Haze crew
were some of the first to do any type of
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And putting their names out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they did, they called it like,
let's see, it was the magenta,
[SPEAKER_03]: silver, blue, and another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did denote that there were
different versions of this haze out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were just called by color names.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might have to broad stroke this one
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did want to ask here, so in general,
broadly speaking, what, and I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: already mentioned this, but what traits do
you want to see passed from a haze type
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm only going to speak on what Neville
would talk about because he was the one
[SPEAKER_03]: most vocal and had the most experience
with breeding original haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were to try to speak on myself,
I mean, my populations were small and I
[SPEAKER_03]: tried different seed lines of original
haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just don't know how similar those
were to what was being seen in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_03]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll talk about from Neville's
experience what he was looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to find the high of haze and the
flavors and the sweetness of Mexican and
[SPEAKER_03]: all the other things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a shorter flowering time,
he wanted to use Indicas and Afghanis,
[SPEAKER_03]: as he put it, to shorten the flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he did not want the high from any of
those to overtake the haze high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was his ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the end, he is like the one thing I
remember most of him talking about haze
[SPEAKER_03]: was that he decided that the haze females
really weren't worth breeding with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he found that the males carried much
more of what he wanted genetically and
[SPEAKER_03]: passed on more genetically than the
females.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, he wasn't doing marker
assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from experience, I found that really
does play into a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville really did know his plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can attest to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was seen in Amsterdam is typically
agreed to be like the Colombian dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Neville got seems to have been very
Colombian gold dominant, according to
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville and his old partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are other versions of haze out
there that are more quote unquote Thai
[SPEAKER_03]: dominant or Southeast Asian, whatever,
a slightly different direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are different groups of people
that have different theories about which
[SPEAKER_03]: directions they should take this original
haze line, original haze seed line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some feel that the real high of haze is in
the Southeast Asian direction,
[SPEAKER_03]: Vietnamese, Thai, whatever was really
used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people are very adamant that
Colombian is the way to find the traits
[SPEAKER_03]: that people want, the Colombian direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know enough about pure Colombian
or pure Southeast Asian from that era to
[SPEAKER_03]: even comment on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's essentially what I've taken
from the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mentioned the high and you
mentioned breeding it with indicas to
[SPEAKER_00]: shorten flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine improved structure as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it.
OK.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a sense of what traits tended
to pass, like in actuality?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in actuality, how often did that high
get passed down?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't sound like the high was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like the thing, the one thing
everybody chases, almost like looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: that skunk scent, you know, like the high
of haze is this mystical thing that a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people really, I mean, there are people
who have really good haze examples like
[SPEAKER_03]: haze hybrid examples with really great
highs that are just blow your head off.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as in pure haze, it seems like it's
been a long chase, a very long chase and
[SPEAKER_03]: not a lot of clonal examples kept in past,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the hybrids have been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what are good examples of hybrids?
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, like the first thing
that comes to my mind is super silver
[SPEAKER_03]: haze, which is a combination of the skunk
one and all five or like five,
[SPEAKER_03]: which we will discuss a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've gone into deep, like so much
detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what much more we
could cover on other than to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it was the other than whatever
Afghani was used in super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably one of the more common
Afghanis used, like the NL one by Neville
[SPEAKER_03]: and them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all five as well was used pretty
heavily, but NL one was usually used as
[SPEAKER_03]: the male in lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do it out cross to things like haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Super silver haze, though, is the first
thing that comes to mind, a combination of
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights five, skunk one and haze
in different, you know, combinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I think skunk ones on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, things like mango haze, Neville's
haze, all great examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: But super silver haze seems to be the one
that has been the oft most repeated and
[SPEAKER_03]: renamed in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the relation to amnesia haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they're close, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've tried to get the answer out
of people, but it sounds like amnesia is
[SPEAKER_03]: just a individual from, I like that word,
an individual from super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're very similar, very,
very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for some reason, amnesia, whether it
was the name or just a slightly faster,
[SPEAKER_03]: better version, of a lot of the super
silver haze examples, it stuck around
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty heavily in Amsterdam and still
passed around in clone form pretty wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, still big in Europe for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, for me, the last question on
haze, are there weird possibilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is probably more true of this
one than a lot of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there weird possibilities or paths
that you can see with haze that people
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't really taken yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a hard question for this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think with the original haze
line, as Sam used to sell it, and like
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen examples from different people
of the current original haze line from Sam
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's like got dense bud and resinous.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nothing like I've seen an original
haze in the past or history or any of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's pretty well documented to not
look like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said, I've seen some pretty
amazing stuff that only like one person's
[SPEAKER_03]: done where like crossing a deep chunk to
haze makes something very modern,
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful, resinous, ticks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think haze has a lot of potential being
crossed to some of these base Afghanis
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of float around like,
you know, like we're seeing a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanis be imported and different
Afghanis accessible.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those make potential, potential great
partners to haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see a lot of unique directions
just coming from using different modern
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that was a real
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think in 2023, it's still worth
trying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people have access to these things?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo, perps, haze, like an old purple
Afghani like that crossed the haze,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think would be pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to consider like the reason a
lot of these people wanted to use haze in
[SPEAKER_03]: the first place was the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And crossing to Afghanis and hoping to
keep that high seems to be the hardest
[SPEAKER_03]: part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the partner will matter for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's all kinds of directions you
could go with it to bring it into the
[SPEAKER_03]: modern times, modern era where,
you know, like little dab kids could enjoy
[SPEAKER_03]: it when they see it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dank, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't smell it, but it looks dank,
whatever that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you'd like to say about
haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that it's still somewhat of a mystery
on its past.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that I've been chasing down
a long time, be it trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_03]: who the haze brothers were, if they're
still around, were they always the
[SPEAKER_03]: original creators of haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's one of those
mysteries in cannabis that I'd like to
[SPEAKER_03]: solve before I'm done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know that I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's one of the most interesting
mysteries in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish more people would jump in on it
like serious, serious researchers and see
[SPEAKER_03]: how far they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did someone like because those are great
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did someone like Mad Jack encounter
haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was not that I'm aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mentioning Skunk One and that like
that story about Rob Clark and the
[SPEAKER_00]: briefcase and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think he was growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was growing a lot of other stuff,
like long flowering, like Mexicans and
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombians and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those were not those were like his own
accessions that he had gotten over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years from Bag Seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't I don't think Rob brought
haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did bring Afghani One though and Skunk
One for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in the looking at the maps and
the different stuff that I have for Mad
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack, there was also Pollyanna in there,
which to me, I mean, like it's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't call it a baseline because how
much did early Pearl and Silver Pearl
[SPEAKER_03]: really pass into modern lines?
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, like it's a baseline
that I'm interested in because I'm so
[SPEAKER_03]: fascinated by the Pearl group.
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, I don't think it's as
important to cannabis history as it is
[SPEAKER_03]: important to me to, you know, to research
and discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, we can move on to Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's do Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should we start on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the first thing is,
again, this is a this is a it's a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a it's not an individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how how wide or narrow would you
consider this line at this point in 2023?
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2023, I mean, Skunk One, I've seen so
many different examples of Skunk One
[SPEAKER_03]: nowadays that are supposedly from pure
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have some Skunk One that's super dense
and smells bland and and earthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Skunk One that's resinous,
looks more narrow leafed, smells cheesy,
[SPEAKER_03]: foot funky all the way to bare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Skunk One seems to be all over the
place to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find lots of different examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rape, still variable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so as always, this is quite a
subjective question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for you, Matt, what would you what
traits do you like to see being passed?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite examples of Skunk One
is probably the green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we don't know what's in green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all the traits kind of mount up to be
Skunk One dominant, like it looks like a
[SPEAKER_03]: great example of Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very heavy mango smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's offspring is very purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that because I like purples for
aesthetic beauty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great commercial producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's resinous enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, today in today's modern market,
green crack might not do as well because
[SPEAKER_03]: people like to see leaf resin a lot,
which most people just cut off,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one of my favorite
examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people's favorite examples are
cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've talked about that clone a bunch
being one of the clones that I've learned
[SPEAKER_03]: most about the plasticity of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I meant to give a definition because I
mentioned it a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like, I didn't know if I
was kind of making shit up, like calling
[SPEAKER_03]: it plastic, because like, you know,
rubber would be probably better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the correct term, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But plant plasticity refers to a plant's
ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is from a plantplasticity.ku.dk.
[SPEAKER_03]: First to a plant's ability to adapt and to
cope with changes in its environment in
[SPEAKER_03]: contrast to animals, which are able to
actively move away to avoid challenges
[SPEAKER_03]: such as predators or changing climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants have acquired the ability to
biosynthesize an unprecedented array of
[SPEAKER_03]: structurally complex bioactive natural
compounds, specialized roles in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: cope with environmental challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what plasticity overall is in a
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I refer to it in Skunk One,
when you have a single clone that when you
[SPEAKER_03]: change the medium, or how you feed it,
and it can go from something as extreme as
[SPEAKER_03]: like, what's a good example, like Gouda
cheese smelling, or like Tofunk cheese,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the way to a sweet berry in the same
clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is super not common to see something
that plastic and versatile in a single
[SPEAKER_03]: clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can imagine breeding with something
like this, you're going to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different examples come out of it,
because it'll have that whole range in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I answered the question,
but... No, you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What traits, I guess the converse is,
what traits would you not like to see
[SPEAKER_00]: being passed from Skunk One?
[SPEAKER_00]: That blando, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I saw all of this, like without
naming any names, a few people released
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk One in the past, you know,
five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that was all bland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blando, earthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's... God, we've got plenty of
that, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much of that in all of today's
modern lines that come from Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blando, Clarissian has to be my next...
That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in every line, even in cookies and
wedding cake, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can run into that Blando Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banana OG has it very heavy, you know,
and it's outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what I try to avoid most from Skunk
One myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe some people like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they like the high from Blando.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not like the high from Blando.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else that can be passed down from
Skunk One that you can think of that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the main thing that comes to
mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, other than like, depending on what
your project is, if you want to breed
[SPEAKER_03]: something very uniform and less plastic,
that would be an undesirable trait if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going for uniformity, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another thing I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as always, you know, what you'd like to
see pass should be relative to your goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Counterpoint though, S1s of Green Crack
were like, I mean, other than the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that most of them were purple looking,
like they all looked like Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is ways to find Skunk One
examples that are more true breeding than
[SPEAKER_03]: others, but like how pure Skunk One it is,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it may be Skunk One S3.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe that's why it's so uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to round Skunk One out, are there
still weird possibilities that people
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't explored in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have we seen enough of it that like
we've more or less seen the range,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe another way of framing it is
like, what's have you seen anything really
[SPEAKER_00]: strange to come out of Skunk One apart
from say cheese, as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: already an outlier?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen anything that I would
consider amazing, wondrous, unique
[SPEAKER_03]: examples out of Skunk One that I haven't
seen prior.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said, like there is some stuff
I think that is worth bringing with like
[SPEAKER_03]: the Green Crack that you can take
different directions and do new novel
[SPEAKER_03]: things with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I think it would be more like
trying to find those art already excellent
[SPEAKER_03]: examples that exist as opposed to trying
to do seat hunts of what's left of Skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: One or is being presented as Skunk One,
because it really feels like it's all been
[SPEAKER_03]: worked in a very specific direction and a
far cry from what it once was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have told that story a few times,
so we won't get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can move on to something you've
already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one we're going to talk
about or how we broad stroke this month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't even know where to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the NL that anybody's ever seen is
NL1, NL2, or NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a quick way to broad brush stroke
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what was used in hybrids were the
NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Neville also used the NL1 a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL2 got used briefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL2 was supposed to be the more cushy
Hindu Kush one.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL1, supposedly like Baba, you know,
like as best people can kind of break
[SPEAKER_03]: apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And NL5 was a hybrid, supposedly,
of a Hawaiian and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was supposed to be more hybrid,
like narrowly mixed in with the broadleaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville tended to like his selections
with the NL5 across the haze over like say
[SPEAKER_03]: NL1 haze or any of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so come back to this whole question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you consider it to be wide,
quote unquote, when narrow in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: variability still?
[SPEAKER_03]: So going through the NL5 that we got from
from what's his name, I'm going to say his
[SPEAKER_03]: name, but the person who supposedly
originated the line, it was quite
[SPEAKER_03]: variable, quite variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a lot of like the earthy
chocolate in it, you know, that I would
[SPEAKER_03]: expect from the Steve Murphy Afghani based
on like the NL1 and NL2.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's it's it's pretty wide in
variance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but it was it was open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the one before that was open
pollinated as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that also could be why.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to say to to to really
speak on knowing that I've seen a perfect,
[SPEAKER_03]: excellent example of NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: While I'm confident, that's what we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot factually state that,
obviously, like that would be too hard to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always some faith in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're always taking someone's
word at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as you can generalize this,
again, what traits tend to be favorable in
[SPEAKER_00]: it and that people like to see past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just in general, what I'll say is NL1,
I mean, it looks like Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like that's just what Bubba might
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's the case, Bubba has so many
amazing traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's why it's still used as one of the
modern lines constantly by people who love
[SPEAKER_03]: it and have kept it for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, like that soapy, earthy,
chocolate, just really dense, perfect for
[SPEAKER_03]: growing indoor is like NL1.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL2 is very similar, maybe a little more
stretchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to think of good examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville thought that OG Kush was an NL2
base.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush for NL2 was Neville's prediction,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was positive, at least on the NL2.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I remember him talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we would discuss OG Kush,
he'd say, that's my NL2.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my NL2, I'm sure of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by looking at it, he thought OG Kush
was a great example of NL2, which as far
[SPEAKER_03]: as traits go, people have consistently
bred towards OG Kush type plants over the
[SPEAKER_03]: past 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we ended up in this
cookie's direction, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a desirable trait to have things
like OG Kush, but desirable traits get
[SPEAKER_03]: compounded over time, then it gets a lot
less desirable, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL5, I don't know enough about him for
undesirables.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only know a few examples to compare them
to, of the NL1 and NL2.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL5, I could talk about all kinds of
undesirables in that, and there's some
[SPEAKER_03]: booths in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another one where back in the day,
when we talk about a high ceiling,
[SPEAKER_03]: low floor, it's a great example of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great example of an 80s hybrid,
where you can find some really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really nice stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the chocolatey stuff in there
is just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolate's not a common thing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did cut you off as you were about to
talk about NL5 desirables, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so yeah, the chocolate is very
desirable, but there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, earthy, low flavor, low potency,
not very resinous, kind of loose-butted
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff in NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all in there, everything from both
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: How variable was in terms of structure?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it had a pretty wide-ranging
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hybrid, so it definitely did have a
wide-ranging structure, but there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of, it wasn't so wide that you would
think, oh, fuck, does that have haze in
[SPEAKER_03]: it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a manageable indoor structure,
everything we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there things that you saw reliably
passed or tended to pass?
[SPEAKER_00]: More frequently than other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard question again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not enough data yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not enough data yet to answer that
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and then last one, as always,
are there weird things that people haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen, tried, considered yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, not enough data yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, considering NL5 was, most people
knew NL5 as a clone that Neville had
[SPEAKER_03]: selected, and we were given an NL5 seed
line that supposedly predated anything
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville touched with, because Neville
modified normal lights, each one,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Amsterdam himself, and none of that was
just pure from Greg, even though he gets
[SPEAKER_03]: upset when I say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just he modified everything,
and NL5 was no different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the NL5 that people are used to and
accustomed to that came from Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_03]: over here will be different than the NL5
that stayed in the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's also that, and we have a lot
more data on NL5 in hybrids, NL5 proper
[SPEAKER_03]: being the clone that Neville used.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the NL5 seed line is still pretty
fresh to everyone, only been around a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years being passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, since we have talked about haze
and we have talked about Northern Lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it worth going into NL5 haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, considering it's a hybrid of two
of the baselines, I don't really think so,
[SPEAKER_03]: other than to say it's a fine example of
an F5 one, roughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it tends to be what spit out a lot of
the keepers during the 90s, was the NL5
[SPEAKER_03]: haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people kept a lot of stuff from
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, when I refer to the high
ceiling, low floor, that's another one
[SPEAKER_03]: where you could get five packs and find
nothing that you liked, and then someone
[SPEAKER_03]: can grab one and find just this killer
example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very much luck of the dice on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine the NL5 haze keepers that we
still have kind of varied enough that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to draw a line through them or
generalize about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we can move on to the Durban.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to clarify here, is this Durban
poison that people talk about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I don't know what it was
originally called.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the name attributed to it,
I got to look at the old catalog from Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to say Durban poison,
when we refer to Durban, Durban poison
[SPEAKER_03]: proper, is what South Africa was producing
as their commercial, but at the time that
[SPEAKER_03]: was being grown down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was brought over by a few different
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel Frank had some and introduced it to
the population as trying to think of who
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: SSSC claimed that they had a different
accession, completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would believe that those tended to
be more terpenaline leaning, whereas Mel
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank's was notoriously more like aniseed,
like black licorice, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was just a commercial African
strain that made its way over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I mean, it's still around,
still being used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of that, I definitely
considered a baseline because it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: never gone away, even though it's not
necessarily known to be in a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still kept, still passed,
you know, in cloned forms and seed lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people still, you know,
bring seed lines over from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I doubt they're very similar to
what they were in the past as far as like
[SPEAKER_03]: being a pure Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch Passions got very famous and that
was like a Durban poison skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that went around as Durban poison as
well, which would be a Durban poison
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people have different ideas of
Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking to the version that you know,
what traits are favorable?
[SPEAKER_03]: The version that I'm most familiar with is
the terpenaline one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it adds a lot of flavor to stuff,
but the flavor also comes with that smell
[SPEAKER_03]: of witch hazel is the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you can go grab a bottle of witch
hazel and smell it, that's typically what
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll smell with the Durban that I'm used
to working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not even sure that's pure Durban,
but it's the one, the clone that runs
[SPEAKER_03]: around California the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very resinous, very potent,
adds flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the positive traits,
yields very well, good density.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finishes fast enough to be run up north.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as breeding, like it's very
unpredictable on what you will cross it
[SPEAKER_03]: with, because sometimes it will just
completely dominate and it'll be seed
[SPEAKER_03]: versions of itself mostly, you know,
at least the smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes the right partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I can say on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the terpenaline and berry
combinations a lot because I feel like it
[SPEAKER_03]: accentuates the berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like terpenaline and bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubblegum smells because I believe that it
brings out the flavor of the bubblegum a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those would be good examples of things
to breed a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sounds really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bunch of the Durban bubblegums
and bubblegum Durbans from CSI,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he did it both ways that we're going
to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not good from it that can come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, it just dominates the gift
curse.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like when Neville used to talk about
terpenaline, he would refer to it as cat
[SPEAKER_03]: piss because some people smell like that
witch hazel smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells cat pissy or ammonia to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells just like witch hazel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smell piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: He referred to it as the cat pissy thing
in haze that is like literally the gift
[SPEAKER_03]: that keeps on giving that you can't chase
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very hard to breed away from it in haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not just haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's in a lot of different lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it pop up in Afghani lines in
Pakistan and many pure lines, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: different lines have that terpenaline
trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's most often associated with Jack
Harrow, train wreck, Durban, things like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to round this one out,
there are weird possibilities with it that
[SPEAKER_00]: people haven't tried seeing considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you mentioned the bubblegum
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting take on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wanted to do... So I had what we
called the 95 centi-star bubblegum
[SPEAKER_03]: expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was supposed to be... It was
superstar from Delta 9 labs, but it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenaline and super pink bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the first time I'd seen the
combination of those two scents and
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just full on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could taste pink bubblegum all through
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the main complaint with the Indiana
bubblegum cut is it has great smell that
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavor doesn't translate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just earthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hashy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just didn't translate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm pretty confident because of what
I've seen with the terpenaline and
[SPEAKER_03]: bubblegum terps in the past that the
ticket's right there in those seed lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other pairing you can imagine
that could be cool that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: speculate about?
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the Durban bonnet, one thing I'll
say is I expected a lot of stuff like Blue
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted some more like terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you did that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know you did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Trademark Chad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's the one.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's had a few different names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to change it because someone got mad
and said that it was their name first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I changed it to Trademark Chad because
he said he was going to trademark it or
[SPEAKER_03]: trademarked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's a Chad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I named after him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, no, what I expected was Blue
Dream type stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I got was all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's even some skunky stuff in there,
which I definitely did not expect from
[SPEAKER_03]: combining terpenaline and hard blueberry
juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are unique things that can be
done with it that are unexpected that I
[SPEAKER_03]: would not predict, even in lines that I
feel like I know real well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there are still things that can
be done with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really hard to think about
things that can be done well with
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenaline and not just automatically
assume it's going to be ultrapenaline
[SPEAKER_03]: based on having used that Durban a bunch
in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is things that can be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not something to give up on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like deep chunk, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't see much value in
deep chunk, the line from Tom Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very earthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like earthy dirt,
derps, just not really great, but very
[SPEAKER_03]: resinous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a decent high to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the terps, people just don't like the
terps on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't like breeding with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's one of those lines where if you
find the right partner for it,
[SPEAKER_03]: the terps kind of set aside themselves and
let the well, I shouldn't say terps,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what would you call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, odor, scent, cannabinoids,
everything passed through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you wouldn't expect it,
but it's cool when it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that told me that maybe there are more
novel things can be done with deep chunk
[SPEAKER_03]: that people haven't really thought of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we'll be doing more stuff with
that in the future, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little shout out to deep chunk there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Hill, the purple prince.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Hill, king of purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we're moving on to Afghani number
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who introduced that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that another Mel Frank one?
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get that wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Afghani one is an old, quote unquote,
pre-Soviet Afghani, supposed to be pure,
[SPEAKER_03]: acrid, ammonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've heard people say green apple
all the way to green apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the Afghani one I saw was all acrid
ammonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some was more loose butted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't really expect that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Afghani one seed line is very not
uniform, but it is what I expect now,
[SPEAKER_03]: knowing older Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all super dense, frosty,
dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a very low selling in Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was some really cool shit in
there, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of what you wouldn't want to
see coming out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What I wouldn't want to see in Afghani
one, the smoke's very harsh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing I remember most about,
like the cut that we ran, was that it was
[SPEAKER_03]: very harsh.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people didn't like smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a pleasant smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would make everyone cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurt to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't because of bad grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a very harsh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's because of the oils
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was always super harsh,
very hashy.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of what I crossed it to just looked
like itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unless you really loved that plant,
it wasn't super desirable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Neville's quotes about it was
that it was like an uninspiring,
[SPEAKER_03]: boring high.
[SPEAKER_03]: He thought it was very bland.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was, like I said, he was into the
haze type highs, the speedy, like very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very different type of high than like a
narcotic, numbing, dumbing down of Afghani
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So over the years, like if you look at old
high times too, it wasn't just Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other people that talk about
Afghani one and just weren't really
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like Aura of the Connoisseur
thought Afghanis were going to be the end
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis, as we know it, with that
being at the spearhead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some undesirable traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Desirable traits, though, like resin
production, that dumbed down, narcotic
[SPEAKER_03]: high could be used and modified to be
something more complex, combined with
[SPEAKER_03]: something hazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many different directions you
could take Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know that all of them have
been done per se, but I don't know that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's really any good seed lines that
represent Afghani one still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your heirloom Afghani?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was from a guy named Bite Me off
of the Mr. Nice forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a dude that was a smuggler back in
Florida during the late 80s, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'd handed me a bunch of different
bags of seed, and only a few had actual
[SPEAKER_03]: labels on what they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we had Afghani, we had this one
called God, and it was predated God Bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had nothing to do with God Bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the first things I asked
when I saw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a Korean Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was like numbers one
through 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just big bags of old bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it was all the seeds he had
kept as a smuggler that he thought was
[SPEAKER_03]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have a lot of info on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Best I can gather is like some kind of
super skunk hybrid, because it lines up
[SPEAKER_03]: with that really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also has very narrow leaves in a
lot of the outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a totally fascinating one to
me, but it's also very like sexually
[SPEAKER_03]: unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually the skunkier stuff is more
sexually unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can see why people would have spread
away from that, because it was so sexually
[SPEAKER_03]: unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's one of those lines that I
felt was really, really special and kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like a little time capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I assume you wouldn't necessarily
relate it to Afghani number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, or do you think you could
still?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some theories out there that
the Afghan tea used in Maple Leaf Indica
[SPEAKER_03]: was actually Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a legitimate theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: In saying that, it would also be saying
that Neville may not have been so honest
[SPEAKER_03]: about what he used in Afghan tea,
but by the time, or in Maple Leaf Indica
[SPEAKER_03]: and super skunk as the Afghan tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But during that time, he wasn't even,
he didn't like Sam the skunk man by that
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see his ego letting him
attribute anything to Sam if he did use
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That acrid nature is definitely in the
heirloom Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's in Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a similarity there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it doesn't mean that it had Afghani
one in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been a similar type Afghani
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the Afghani number one,
again, are there weird paths that people
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't taken yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said, I don't know if the seed
line's out there to be gotten pure
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed's been selling it for a long time,
but it slowly drifted away from what most
[SPEAKER_03]: people knew is Afghani one and nobody was
really happy with what they were getting
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which it could just be taking it in a bad
direction over the years and be the same
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's one of those ones where I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's still possible to
even get a pure seed line like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that represents what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a good one to cover off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you want to say about that
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can move on to a favorite old
school blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a little debate on whether they
should go into old school or modern.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really do think it belongs just like
at that mid 90s to late 90s period kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: pushes it back into that Dutch era of
being old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I could wax poetic about blueberry
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with the basic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how wide or narrow do you think it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberry proper, more narrow than most
lines now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of DJ's approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wacky reading approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say that with a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wacky, crossing two different,
completely different opposite types over
[SPEAKER_03]: several generations will make for some
weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically he kept widening and didn't
do very much narrowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept widening and inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the two, like, I don't even know how.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the opposite intention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like from a breeding perspective,
like thinking about that way, I would
[SPEAKER_03]: like, if I tried to rationalize that,
I would be like, okay, well, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing the opposite of what I'm trying
to achieve, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, am I trying to widen it or
am I trying to make it totally inbred?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are two different directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by doing like crossing, using roughly
two or three plants and crossing Sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: looking to Indica looking in the same
line, multiple generations is literally
[SPEAKER_03]: doing opposite work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what you mean now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he it's inbreeding in the sense that
he's kept it within the family,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, but he wasn't using similar
individuals with in the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Divergent kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very interesting artistic approach
to breeding for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what traits do you like seeing past?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like seeing actual berry smells past
because the high to that is what like I
[SPEAKER_03]: always associate with anti-anxiety high
for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't necessarily ring true for
everyone on earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please don't apply it to yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people will smoke blueberry and
fucking hate it and like make some flip
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely don't want to insinuate
that it works that way for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, if I have blueberry sense,
like blueberry jam type sense,
[SPEAKER_03]: or even blueberry muffin type sense,
I know that generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be a mild, happy ride for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to yank me to a place that
like, all of a sudden I'm like in the
[SPEAKER_03]: corner going, fuck, I messed up today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have, you know, like it doesn't
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I appreciate about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I love it so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a trait that I love is that berry
scent because of how it affects me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as other traits, there's beautiful
purples in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, DJ has some of the most
beautiful, unique looking work that's ever
[SPEAKER_03]: existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does seem to have a fairly distinctive
look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can spot it in anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I really can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked with all of it enough to where
I can spot blueberry in anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very distinctive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, like I said, there's so many
different families of blueberry,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're all the same family.
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ took it like there's a blue moonshine
direction in the old time moonshine
[SPEAKER_03]: direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was flow, which isn't even the berry
selection, but it's like two of the three
[SPEAKER_03]: parents as opposed to all three parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a completely separate line,
but still related, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: still causes some inbreeding issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanaluna, which is like the blueberry
sativa direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's F13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is also another attempt at the
blueberry sativa direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his modern blueberry, like to me,
is more like a little squat Afghani type,
[SPEAKER_03]: which, you know, a lot of people typically
think of blueberry sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you grow modern DJ blueberry,
you're not going to get stuff very close
[SPEAKER_03]: to what a lot of people expect from
blueberry sativa back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you not like to see past?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of trouble I've had with blueberry
has been when I breed with it inside
[SPEAKER_03]: itself and don't outcross at all and have
no outcrosses anywhere in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of mutations.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's albinism, which is a horrible
trait, in my opinion, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaves grow out white and you can't
there's no energy for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't reflect light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a lot of really negative
mutations and recessive traits in
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I've noticed is with a single
outcross, if you use the right male or
[SPEAKER_03]: female from the blue line and outcross,
those mutations almost immediately
[SPEAKER_03]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get a lot of the great traits
that blueberry brings in hybrids,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is why its popularity, in my
opinion, took off when people were making
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the most famous lines out there,
like the blue dream or what else is a good
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have bubble berry, the original
bubble berry, things like that are so
[SPEAKER_03]: beloved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, a question that's very close to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other directions or paths that
you can see still remain to be taken?
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to cover all the bases.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, like one thing I didn't expect
when crossing it's like triangle was a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of Chinese food turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there are a lot of different savoury.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very savoury.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely savoury with no berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, there's a lot of different
directions and unique directions you can
[SPEAKER_03]: take a good, like a really good selection
of blueberry that don't even necessitate
[SPEAKER_03]: having berry smells or any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's a it's a good line for pretty
much anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exploration line is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For exploration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to I mean, like referring to
DJ's lines proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say in hybrids is their best.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say low, low ceiling,
high floor, because there aren't a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry clones kept from that are like
specifically from DJ's lines that people
[SPEAKER_03]: are like, this is my DJ short blueberry
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It rocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It rocks the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm passing it around and made it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't happen a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have DJ's 98 selection from his F4 line
that he selected that's passed around a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different blueberry clones out
there with no real good provenance,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Dabney Blue is one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's another one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even even my Riot Berry OG, the original
blueberry muffin cut was the provenance
[SPEAKER_03]: was we don't know that it was directly
from DJ's.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of blueberry cuts out there
that are like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of it's cool to know,
though, that the presumably then that the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry sent profile isn't confined to
that family necessarily that like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to see it crop up in other
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, there is a a sour diesel cross to
Irene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like I cannot prove that Irene
doesn't have blueberry in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if not, that sour diesel Irene was
some of the most blueberry cereal
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry muffin type stuff that I've ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it pops up fairly regularly in that
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think of diesel and Irene,
would you think that that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility or is that a complete
surprise?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a complete surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, oh, G Kush, some some expressions
of it you can get are almost like sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: cereal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that part I can see like almost like a
trick cereal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having it a sour diesel and Irene like
burnt rubber and Irene, I would think
[SPEAKER_03]: would pull it more towards like this burnt
rubber, like harsh OG tones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, G Kush type tones, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're there in some of those
expressions, but like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That expression was full on blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's we called it the souring 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's phenomenal, phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of us keep it still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sounds like a very cool part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've heard of people getting blueberry
from things like Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's also that, you know,
like it's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different things putting out berry
towns for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, anything else on the blueberry map?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that I own JD Short Soul.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that rounds out our coverage of
like the older generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can move on to what we
would consider some of the more modern
[SPEAKER_00]: building blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just mentioned it, but we can
start with the OG Kush, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as best we know, this traces back to
the Triangle Kush as best we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as Triangle Kush, a lot of
people think it's related to Chem 91 could
[SPEAKER_03]: be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might just be similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no like facts there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Triangle Kush seems to be the origin
point for OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best way to describe OG Kush in a
roundabout way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a very specific bud structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very low calyx leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the way it goes lower high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always forget that how that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's not a lot of stuff to trim on
an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why one of the reasons that
people loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very dense, cushy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like it depends on the cut you
have and how you grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be really soapy, piney.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be fuely, gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be earthy as fuck if it's grown
real midsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and then there's also sweet
versions of OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think for me, the high, like the
best way to equate it would be the most
[SPEAKER_03]: well-rounded high of any of the clones
that I've run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or plants or lines or any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it seems to have the best of the
Afghani type highs that people most
[SPEAKER_03]: associate with Afghanis being narcotic or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also very cerebral.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gets people twisted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it'll make it so you can't drive if
you smoke a good OG and like get twisted
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's major components.
[SPEAKER_03]: It breeds really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the reasons I think OG took off
was because it was during the early days
[SPEAKER_03]: of the collectives and it was a clone that
you could hybridize and it routinely give
[SPEAKER_03]: you over 25% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because collectives were so driven at
THC numbers, I think it was almost like a
[SPEAKER_03]: self-fulfilling prophecy that OG Kush got
used so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was the one thing reliably
passing those THC numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were bad things, or not bad,
what were less favorable traits to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The lank, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody likes the OG lank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody likes to have to stop their plants
and like, or stake it and like net it and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like having to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've almost lost my eye a thousand
times on stakes because of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'd say that is the main bad
trait from OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of bad that comes from
OG Kush, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very easy- So OG Kush may cause
blindness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many friends that have had their
eyes like permanent scars by their eyes
[SPEAKER_03]: from getting hit with stakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the flop, the lank, that's the
most undesirable trait in OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_03]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of any other
undesirable trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there really isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even in hybrids that have grown in
the S1s, you definitely see it all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very consistent for the structure,
the high, the smell, the potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think just because it made
everyone look like a professional breeder
[SPEAKER_03]: once you had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you have OG Kush, every single seed
line that you're kicking out crossed with
[SPEAKER_03]: it is upwards of 23% THC if grown,
okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: If grown midsy, it'll be about 23% block.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it made a lot of people really look
more effective and knowledgeable and just
[SPEAKER_03]: effective at breeding because they were
using OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we saw what happened with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody did the same thing and got the
same idea and realized the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we, in a sense, you could call
it like, quote unquote, a family,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really it's like a collection of
different cuts that people have kept right
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a collection of different bag
seeds of one cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a bag seed of a bag seed of one cut
that constantly kept that expression going
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to try this question for this one
because it does tend to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you go about making this into a
regular line?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I saw one person try to go make an OG
Kush regular seed line using an Afghani
[SPEAKER_03]: outcross.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Afghani outcross that he used was auto
flowering and kind of hermaphroditic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I think he had the right idea in
using an Afghani type because that'll
[SPEAKER_03]: help, help pull down some of that link.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think Urkel has made excellent
outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like maybe an Urkel regular seed line
makes excellent outcrosses to OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for just keeping OG, like OG,
I would recommend like a Bubba back cross
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get some of the structure back of
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba, Bubba Kush already has OG Kush in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're reinforcing a lot of the OG Kush
traits while bringing in some of that
[SPEAKER_03]: structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I like, I like Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because Bubba is still pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba veg is very differently still,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's squat, slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes like I, there's,
you can grow Bubba lanky too, almost like
[SPEAKER_03]: OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, it has way better
structure than Bubba if you're,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're growing it well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've seen it grown bad, lanky as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen Bubba grow lanky and be quite
lanky and in poor situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I think that's a good call though
on how that's a good approach for
[SPEAKER_00]: attempting a regular line with the OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of Bubba BX seed lines out
there that are regular seed lines using
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one with the out cross being the
heirloom Afghani, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just crossed with Bubba extremely
well made for a true breeding Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything looked like Bubba and smelled
like Bubba from the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit skunkier that,
you know, like it was pretty Bubba and
[SPEAKER_03]: that would make for an excellent out
cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any kind of male from that would be an
excellent out cross to make an OG Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last question, which I think for,
for this, for this group of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: like is a funny one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there possibilities that we haven't
seen yet with the OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've seen it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen everything with that
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I can't really think of anything
off hand that could be done with OG
[SPEAKER_03]: better, but yeah, no, I, that's definitely
one that I can't really think of anything
[SPEAKER_03]: that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought maybe we may as well cover up
Bubba since you've already mentioned it a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it's, it is kind of a
baseline.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as popular as it once was,
but like you have stuff like Kushman's,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that has Bubba in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic things, I guess, like what
would you like to see pass from the Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: and what would you not?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see everything pass from
Bubba, but I'm a Bubba freak, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like Bubba as is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, some people don't like Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Bubba a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like seeing Bubba pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a really great clone that we kept.
[SPEAKER_03]: We called Bubba Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out of Bubba S1s that were likely
pollen contaminated because this was such
[SPEAKER_03]: an outlier and I haven't seen it in Bubba
S1s again in either a CSI, but it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it had a big, what would be traditionally
more like something people would associate
[SPEAKER_03]: more quote unquote Sativa structure,
big, huge colas with the big, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: pyramid shape at the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it smelled like Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had like the high of OG Kush,
which Bubba doesn't necessarily have on
[SPEAKER_03]: its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just so fucking good and
smelled so good, like a amped up turped
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been chasing it ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking for that ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since I can't find an S1s,
it just has to be a product of pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: contamination, which means who knows what
it was, but I would really like to find
[SPEAKER_03]: something very similar again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the high, like you were
saying, I imagine, sorry, I imagine what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to say is that the high was
a better rounded high than the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just narcotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Bubba does have a well-rounded
high for the most part, but this was what
[SPEAKER_03]: I would call a no ceiling high where you
can keep smoking it and getting more and
[SPEAKER_03]: more high and higher, but it just didn't
have any of the anxiety effects that I get
[SPEAKER_03]: with stuff that usually is like that,
the no ceiling high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess we're, we're kind of in this
zone already, but are there many paths
[SPEAKER_00]: that you see are still untrodden when it
comes to Bubba?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that Bubba Sativa itself was so
rare that like the fact that that could be
[SPEAKER_03]: created from Bubba, even from a pollen
contamination tells me that there's other
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff out there that definitely could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a, a Bubba Rose Flow, which was a
old Dutch passion flow release really
[SPEAKER_03]: early release of DJ Short's flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we crossed that and on its own that
Rose Flow was not ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very sparse, not good density,
little to no resin production.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so inbred.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so fucking inbred.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every plant looked pretty identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the leaf cannibalism thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all bright red and beautiful
that way in color, but the rest of it was
[SPEAKER_03]: just not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we crossed it to Bubba and it
immediately took all the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I haven't found a bad plant in that
Bubba Rose Flow at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So taking something that was like,
that I wouldn't have normally used or
[SPEAKER_03]: kept, I was really interested to see how
it would go with Bubba and a few other
[SPEAKER_03]: things just because it was so wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bubba tamed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba tamed it really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, it was a complete like
incense-y, like really like Nag Champa
[SPEAKER_03]: incense Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's definitely unique novel
directives to take it, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that called Red Menace?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a Bubba Rose Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you'd like to say about the
Bubba before we move on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the rocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sucks it and not more people use it
or are as familiar with it as they were in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for a while it held its own kind
of like OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Bubba was in, you'd see like all
these Bubba hybrids and collectives that
[SPEAKER_03]: you could buy and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Bubba Rec was big back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was all kinds of Bubba hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nowadays it's kind of, it's not used
as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to see it injected more
into the culture because it's different
[SPEAKER_03]: than OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different than Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a personal note, when I was still
flailing around in my first couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years of growing, I grew out some Bubba
S1s and they were the best things that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: ever grown at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe my first real encounter with
growing really good wheat myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it will always hold the spot
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's also some stuff that me and CSI
talk about, or I'll say CSI talks about
[SPEAKER_03]: with me, I should say.
[SPEAKER_03]: In going through his Bubba S1 populations,
there's one that he found that he loves.
[SPEAKER_03]: He calls it like lemon head candy Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see a lot of lemon in Bubba,
but this was an outlier that does pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's other things that are more
darker colored and blue colored in Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he refers to as the blue indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a lot of stuff in those
Bubba S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people think Bubba is just Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go through those S1s and go
through enough of them, you'll see some
[SPEAKER_03]: wild, very different experiences that
stand out and are completely unique to
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else that we have out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have lemon heads candy stuff,
but the high to it is supposed to be
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have things like the bomb
threat Bubba and other, other different
[SPEAKER_03]: expressions of Bubba that are like,
you know, slightly lemony and really
[SPEAKER_03]: potent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself a pack of Bubba S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be stupid people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think CSI is doing a round of,
he's, he's doing another round of Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we can move on to another
favorite, the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already know the answer to some of
these questions, but let's just go over
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How wide or narrow would you consider the
91?
[SPEAKER_03]: Narrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would consider it very narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've mentioned it many times,
but there is plenty of circulation that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is itself in S1.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's a lot of speculation on
that, but you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to prove at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you like, what traits would you
like to see passed and what traits would
[SPEAKER_00]: you not like to see passed in the 91?
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, typically with 91, the traits
that people want to pass are the potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I've smelled 91 turned up to like a 30
volume as far as turps go in a regular
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line based on Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I could get those turps passed out
of Chem 91, that would be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't often see that because like,
well, you can see when you get to smell
[SPEAKER_03]: what probably Chem 91 smelled like as a
clone, like originally before it was all
[SPEAKER_03]: beat up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could see why it was kept around
because it was so unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have words for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause not many people I think have
hazarded, like hazarded like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: an account of its smell before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'll try, I'll try.
[SPEAKER_03]: So immediately when I think of Chem 91 and
trying to list the smell, I go for the
[SPEAKER_03]: ammonia acrid, similar to Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ammonia acrid is in there, but there is
something else in there that I,
[SPEAKER_03]: curry is not right, but it's not
necessarily off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some kind of savory there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the, Chem 91, Chem Di 95 that I was
referring to from Natalie, that was like
[SPEAKER_03]: a, like Chem 91 turned up to a 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, that was almost more prevalent than
the ammonia or any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I was like, Oh my God,
this is so fricking unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I smelled that smell in Chem 91,
but never to that volume, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's, it's hard to say like
calling it a curry isn't quite accurate,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's savory in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's ammonia, there's, there's burnt
tennis ball rubber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the way most people would
describe it first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the clone as it is now,
that's the most apparent smell is like
[SPEAKER_03]: that tennis ball, burnt rubber,
but there are other smells in Chem 91 that
[SPEAKER_03]: can be coaxed out of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those are some of my favorite
smells from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, another personal anecdote and
I'm no authority on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only grown a few S1s, but one of the
things that I did smell in my favorite one
[SPEAKER_00]: was this kind of like what I call like a,
quite a dark smell, like a charred meat
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you're describing what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very likely it's, it's, it is so hard
to describe that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as always, we're just talking in
impressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another thing that I, I recently saw
from the Chem 91 that I'd never seen
[SPEAKER_03]: before was a very soapy expression that
reminded me of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't exactly like OG Kush,
but I see why people are like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that smells like OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they would, it was a scent in that
direction of OG Kush, but I don't think it
[SPEAKER_03]: was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I see why people are like,
Oh, I can smell why that's related to OG
[SPEAKER_03]: if they come across that expression in the
91 S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, from my part, you know,
home growers impression, I did run TKS
[SPEAKER_00]: ones and 91 S1s in the same run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did see some quite interesting or
like smell or taste some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: overlaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I can also see it from my view.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very fragmentary experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: What traits would you not like to see past
from the 91?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, 91, it has the, the lovely trait of
forever throwing white hairs long past its
[SPEAKER_03]: maturation date, like long past when you
harvest, it'll keep kicking them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just ignore it and don't even
notice it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It blows my mind that some people don't
notice that trait, but it's very apparent
[SPEAKER_03]: trait to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other trait is the leaf cannibalistic
trait where instead of going through
[SPEAKER_03]: senescence and just, you know,
fading out slowly, its leaves start just
[SPEAKER_03]: crumbling off and like it's a leaf
necrosis that happens as it fades.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a good book.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not, that's not a good book at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to get beautiful pictures
of Chem 91 and flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for people who are used to seeing
modern cookie type weed and that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's their like mark benchmark for what
weed should look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem 91 would look very ugly, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it would look very ugly to most
people, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ugly to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ugly as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's an ugly ass mat, personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Puck, ugly as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem 91, ugly as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has great traits, has great breeding
traits, whereas the Puck I think has
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Chem 91 for sure has some good
breeding traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a generally, that's a
common issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shared opinion, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody in our crew who is going to Puck
all shares that fucking opinion with me
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, in terms of the frequency of
these things passing, that is also really
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the potency is consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf necrosis is consistent as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chem 91 dominance, like, I mean,
it tends to make stuff look like Chem 91
[SPEAKER_03]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because again, this is a clone,
I'm going to ask that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you think you would approach
making it into a regular line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like using the old Afghani one seed line,
not a modern one, but like the old one
[SPEAKER_03]: that the LA AFI clone that we had came
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go with that, find a regular male
in there and use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem 91 is so Afghani dominant that I
think taking it any other direction would
[SPEAKER_03]: be pointless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have access to something like
that, I imagine a common one is like an OG
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that that would just take it
in one specific direction that would
[SPEAKER_03]: muddle it up with OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to keep it Chem-y, you know,
Matt Elite did great using the Chem-D
[SPEAKER_03]: I-95, which I wouldn't have thought to use
because it was such a poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when he told me about it,
I was kind of not interested as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the poly hybrid nature,
the Chem-D and I-95 is a legend,
[SPEAKER_03]: triangle and a star dog, if I remember
correctly, is the I-95.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was thinking, well, if you're trying
to find Chem 91, why are you using all
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff that's potentially all over the
place?
[SPEAKER_03]: But Matt knew his shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He nailed it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for a regular seed line, I'd say,
and it probably is accessible for some
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did he call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Resurrection is what he called it,
the seed line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd use that all day, every day for Chem
91.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should have been my first thought,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going from scratch, I'd use like an Akron
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you want to say on the 91?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that if Natsuo were here,
he would be trying to argue how beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he can't right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're a bit more of a
contrarian, I can see it, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get tired of seeing Instagram
stuff, and the ugly stuff starts to look
[SPEAKER_00]: better, in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just because it's been in his
life for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like talking about one of his kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, wait, that is not ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a couple of times when he
obviously got triggered by you saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the last time we spoke about it,
I said, watch, I'm going to make you
[SPEAKER_03]: triggered on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did it and made him get
triggered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the predictability of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can move on to an adjacent one,
which is another big, big, big favorite,
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as we know, there are multiple
cuts, but we'll do our best.
Always have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: How narrow or wide?
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on which cut you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm referring to sour, I'm going to
refer to ECSD, Choco, the one that most of
[SPEAKER_03]: us hold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to refer to that cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one itself, there is some
variance in Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a skunk one, Afghan T.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, sour seems to breed pretty true
to sour, in my experience, as long as
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not crossing it to crazy
polyhybrids that are bringing in tons of
[SPEAKER_03]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're crossing it, for example,
to blueberry or something very true
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding for a few traits, sour can be
very, very, very uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within that uniformity, what are the
traits that people like to see?
[SPEAKER_03]: In sour, so I've talked about this a lot,
specifically the dog tongue trait is what
[SPEAKER_03]: we call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's so hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I put up pictures of it and circled
the dog tongues and people still miss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they don't get that I'm referring to a
very round, rounded type leaf,
[SPEAKER_03]: not a pointed leaf, not just any small
leaf in the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that the pattern of
arrangement of these dog tongue leaves is
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the traits of sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, how sour is easily
identifiable, these specific traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those traits are carried from Super
Skunk as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scent trait, burnt rubber, skunky all day
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: More burnt rubber than skunky,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of its other major traits is that
it has this wonderful thing it leaves on
[SPEAKER_03]: your palate, almost like thick oils on
your tongue that you can taste after you
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another trait from sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the high, it is very potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would equate it to something like
maybe closer to the OG Kush high,
[SPEAKER_03]: but more of a traditionally quote unquote
sativa type experience, more cerebral than
[SPEAKER_03]: just OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hate staining things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alongside what you call the dog tongue
leaves, it's also got those swollen
[SPEAKER_00]: bracts, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the swollen bracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's another thing from Super
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it in Giselle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it in all kinds of different
Super Skunk plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the swollen bracts and the
pattern of the dog tongue leaves,
[SPEAKER_03]: like for me, that's the telltale signs of
sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are less favorable traits that you
see sometimes come through?
[SPEAKER_03]: Stretch, just like OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: People hate the stretch of sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanky as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another thing with sour is you can grow
it, nail it perfect, and then lose all of
[SPEAKER_03]: it in the drying cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very easy to get midsy sour,
like put all that time and effort in and
[SPEAKER_03]: just lose it in the cure really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, even to people who are really
experienced and good with curing and
[SPEAKER_03]: drying, it can happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's one of the traits with
sour like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Burnt rubber can fade pretty fast and turn
into just like musty, boofy smell over
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It dissipates pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a very desirable trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it's first harvested and cured
right like that, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is a clone, how would you go
about making it into a regular line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, sour into a regular line.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of the best seed lines of
sour have been combinations of different
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush hybrids and sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush combines really well with sour for
whatever reason, like whether it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: high, the way it smells when they combine,
but like it is different than just sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very OG based when that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm going to make a regular seed
line of sour, I would probably use one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the many regular diesel seed lines because
that'll get you closer back to super skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: and double up on the super skunk trait,
which we think is a double recessive and
[SPEAKER_03]: reinforce that in all the progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I would choose a diesel regular
seed line from anyone that has that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the other obviously we just
mentioned it, but what is your take on
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel 91 like crosses?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a hard one because I think
it's great because it double reinforces a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of traits, but that would also be
presupposing that 91 has super skunk in
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does lock in a lot of the same
traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really hard to argue it
plant-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess the other quite popular
theory is that if there's no super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: in 91, there might still be 91 in the
sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's for sure 91 is sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's very debatable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there weird possibilities with the
sour that people haven't considered?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, most of what we've seen with
sour tends to be in like that sour OG
[SPEAKER_03]: direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: People trying to remake headband as they
have heard that it's made.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't seen a lot of novel sour
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, CBF did his strawberry sour,
which is one of my favorite lines of all
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The strawberry cough, strawberry cream,
which is supposedly a strawberry cough S1.
[SPEAKER_03]: The strawberry cream, East Coast sour
diesel is one of my favorite lines of all
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was because it was so unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: But taking that strawberry rubber type
stuff and throwing strawberry jam type
[SPEAKER_03]: turps on it, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's so many novel direction
sour can be taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my blue sour, I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't see a lot of blueberry sour out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of different directions
people can take it that they just haven't
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually more potential than I thought
for something as popular and as long held
[SPEAKER_00]: as that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else on the sour map that you
wanted to address?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to say that sour was probably a few
different clones early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to find the original sour is
kind of a moot point.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be considered original if they
were all kind of popped at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only note I would make on that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we move on to another favorite in
this crowd, which is the purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, real quick before we exit sour,
I just wanted to make a quick note for
[SPEAKER_03]: people in our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are able to see a kind of a sour
episode we did with Klopp and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: available to be seen if you're part of the
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't finished and it's not a like
produced, well produced or edited.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in its entirety.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're part of the Patreon,
you can see that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a very interesting piece of
content still for the nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Urkel, how wide or narrow?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wide and narrow at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say like relative to a lot of
lines, it's narrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you explore Urkel, like Urkel,
the Urkel type is about 20% of what you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: see in self Urkel, which means that
there's a lot of variability in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like if 20% look like Urkel from
S1s and there's pretty wide swath,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though comparatively to other lines,
it's probably more narrow.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorable and unfavorable traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the best grapes ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the best grapes ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of its out-crosses have beautiful
purple colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not necessarily consistent for
out-crossing purple, despite its name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even grown, there's been a lot of like
green grows of Urkel, that same clone
[SPEAKER_03]: where it just doesn't go purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grape Extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the best grapes, period.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't like its leaf to calyx ratio
kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's squat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really like its branching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Short node, like inner node spacing,
not desirable at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does breed pretty well for that
trait.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think mostly grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does well in out-crosses.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already mentioned the OG pairing
really well with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it from the point of view
already of what you're saying about its
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned the grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's its potency like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine it's not one of the more potent
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a weird one because testing
wise, 18% THC, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people don't get any effect from
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people think it's just completely
mild, worthless to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit gives me the fear every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not necessarily a potent thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a quality of the high that just
does not mix well with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that's very Urkel dominant,
I just don't smoke anymore because it puts
[SPEAKER_03]: me in bad places every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really reliable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So potency is debatable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much depends on the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned it's kind of less ideal
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other things that are less than
ideal about it or traits that it may pass?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with the 20% being Urkel types,
there's probably a good 60% that are just
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of midsy in the S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there's a lot of undesirable in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like muted grape, just not really great
high, not really resonance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the OGKB mutant type,
which most people call like OGKB,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's just basically how to explain
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's not crinkle leaves and it's not
webbed leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people refer to OGKB.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a correct way to describe it,
but the leaves overlap on each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's three leaves to overlap on
top and almost look like duck's foot type,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're not webbed or like a true
duck's foot from Wally Duck.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it has that weird leaf
overlaying trait like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see it a lot in Urkel
outcrosses and S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where like the OGKB type comes
from is from a pure Urkel mutation that
[SPEAKER_03]: can be considered undesirable looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But OGKB is a amazing stellar example,
you know, like, so while it may look
[SPEAKER_03]: undesirable in the end, that's a desirable
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apart from it pairing well with the OG,
what are the pairings with the Urkel that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've seen as successful?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem91 does well with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour did well with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubblegum did well with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The white did amazing with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The things that let that like 20%
expression of Urkel fly through real well,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the white where it just turns up the
resin production lets Urkel shine or the
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel bubblegums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all that shit was fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of like Rascal did a lot of
great shit with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of my like other than CSI who's
done the most work with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rascal's hybrids with Urkel early on were
just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I constantly reference when I
think about like awesome Urkel hybrids is
[SPEAKER_03]: Rascal's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it still give you the fear in those
outcrosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so beautiful though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the white Urkel I love to grow just
because it is so fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like picture Urkel with like the
resin of the white just cake leaf tip to
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't like smoking it just
because it affected me very negatively.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, everybody around me like smoking it,
you know, but yeah, kind of ruined it for
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because it's a clone, how would you
go about trying to make it into a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: line?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be a good Urkel outcross to
maintain the grape Skunk 1?
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, like Urkel is a combination
of something across to Skunk 1 because in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Urkel outcrosses you can see a lot of
the Skunk 1 type turps, oniony,
[SPEAKER_03]: cheesy and all that stuff's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe a Skunk 1 type outcross that is
leaning towards grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a good regular seed line
that I had that was called Kush Skunk that
[SPEAKER_03]: was super grapey and dense like Urkel that
I think would make for an amazing regular
[SPEAKER_03]: seed outcross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's still around peak
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Kush Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, that's a good tip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick, hardcore underrated company,
Peak Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get a lot of mentions except
from the old school dudes that ran it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their Northern Berry was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a lot of berry work that was
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their Kush Skunk where it doesn't have
like a fancy name.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like kind of like, ooh,
Kush Skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to give them their dues, you know,
because I don't think they get,
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't do a lot of advertising
anywhere and they're a great company.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any, any weird alternative paths that
people haven't yet taken?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you could see them taking?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of my favorite was the Urkel
Tray Dog from High and Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made something that they called Dog
Waltz.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a cut from it called the
Poodle Nuts that is still wholly unique to
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else in cannabis that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The structure, the scent, all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a phenomenal cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did have a similar structure to Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really tight inter node spacing,
but the high, all of it made up for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a little bit of a hermit trait,
but like when you have something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: special and I could smoke it, like it's
one of the few Urkel Hypers I could smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, all to say that that was a
completely wholly unique expression for
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel that I hadn't seen yet in a cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot more out there that
can be done like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people think outside of the box,
like High and Lonesome did back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of flavor were you getting from
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Grapey a lot, except there was
some skunkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the one thing that I remember most
about Poodle Nuts was when we took cuts of
[SPEAKER_03]: it in veg, it would stink up fucking,
you know, a 3000 square foot house,
[SPEAKER_03]: just taking cuts off one single mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled like skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing smelled skunkier than veg material
of Poodle Nuts ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing compares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that something y'all have said about
the Urkel as well in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a lot of skunky smells out of
it in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, even in flour, like the first four
weeks of flour, it's super skunky and then
[SPEAKER_03]: it just turns grape all of a sudden at the
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of disappointing in that sense,
but yeah, that's how she goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if it's possible that that could
be drawn out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could be coaxed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I definitely think it could.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even in that tray dog,
if you ran enough of the Urkel tray dog,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you could have done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you could find that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And High and Lonesome made a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have some old seeds of it too,
of Dog's Waltz original from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you'd like to say about the
Urkel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just shout out to CSI, High and Lonesome,
Bodhi, all the other people who inspired
[SPEAKER_03]: me to even be using Urkel in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we move on to cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: To round out the modern building blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The modern building blocks, it would be
very hard to leave cookies out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite it maybe being a hybrid of Urkel
types, OG types and whatever F1 derb is,
[SPEAKER_03]: it itself has become a very modern,
very baseline because it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: find any modern lines that do not have
cookies in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be that way with OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: When cookies made its introduction,
there was also a big boom of seed makers
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like OG, it was a plant where anybody
could make crosses with it and it would
[SPEAKER_03]: look very decent on Instagram because it
would all look like cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cookies is this very frosty,
dense, purple, black, beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it was very, it just made a lot
of people look very talented because it
[SPEAKER_03]: was very easy to make photogenically.
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there's not a lot of people who
are like, fuck, I love smoking cookies,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 10 years later, it's not like OG
Kush where people, where that high is
[SPEAKER_03]: still chased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I can also already say that in
the wide, narrow question, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely on the narrow side,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like when you get down to the
gelatos, there's not, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mean, I shouldn't say that
because some people love gelatos,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you've hit gelato and you try to
make like gelato crosses, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: usually end up with more gelatos unless
it's a very severe outcross.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most people are breeding towards more
cookie looking stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't typically see like,
like when we did the chocolate tie forum
[SPEAKER_03]: cut, we were trying to breed away from
cookies into the chocolate tie line we
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what made it unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like when you breed it back to more
cookies, you're just getting more cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the best traits of cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Low calc to leaf ratio, consistent
potency, high, high, high resin production
[SPEAKER_03]: and aesthetic beauty.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actual oils in the resin glands that are
so copious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's not that great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can have a lot of stocks and
stuff, make something look very frosty,
[SPEAKER_03]: but have very low oil content in the,
in the resin glands on the head.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you just see more cookies and more
cookies, more resinous stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wedding cakey stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: All over the place.
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even ever want to ask this
question for cookies, but I may as well
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've been doing it for the
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it's a cut, how would you make
into a regular line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Realistically, you're making a regular
line of cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you out cross to anything that is like
a short squat, little low yielding Afghani
[SPEAKER_03]: type, you can pretty, pretty typically
like pick up a easy breeding cookies line
[SPEAKER_03]: in a few steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can take into F2 or VX1,
any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that, that's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be pretty easy to make a cookies
line just because it reads so true to
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there, are there paths to take with
cookies that we haven't seen yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, probably, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, probably like, I don't think
cookies is the end of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think the like gelato is like,
I think that's the end result of cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do a gelato to try to save it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like crossing gelato to some, like,
I don't know, like a Burmese, like a 21
[SPEAKER_03]: week Burmese might be interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we're like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be really hard to find something
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, with cookies, I still think you
could cross into stuff like that and find
[SPEAKER_03]: really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you actually want to take it
someplace different, which it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not that many people have,
have wanted that for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: or tried to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like to me, most of the cookie
stuff, is like OG across the cookies,
[SPEAKER_03]: across the OG, across the cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's 99% of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people went one direction for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything else you want to say about
cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure if you, if you do some
research, you'll find out that there's all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of in cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to happen at least once an episode,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just so classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely relevant to cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag never forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never get phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that does take us to the end of our
list of modern building blocks,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're at one 38.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what else we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to shout out any other lines
that didn't lines or plants that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite make it in to either of these
sections?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a gesture towards them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything on the top of your head?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, like I said, there's stuff
like Swazi really borrowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's like Durbin tie high
flyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a tie that was used in that
there's, there's been random lines that
[SPEAKER_03]: have been used or, or accessions from
different land races that have been used
[SPEAKER_03]: and stayed for a while in lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we, when we were talking about
doing this, this list, it was really
[SPEAKER_03]: mainly trying to find the lines that have
carried on into modern times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and there's really only a few that
really, really made their mark and kept
[SPEAKER_03]: carrying on to modern, modern times that
we can identify like, oh, that's a skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: one trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's a haze trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's we've seen a lot less haze traits
in American America and haze type plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and it's sativa type plants that are
people plants that people would typically
[SPEAKER_03]: call sativa in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen a lot of the Afghani explosion
and it's kind of because of home growing
[SPEAKER_03]: situations and the legalities,
I think that it's, it's typically gone
[SPEAKER_03]: that direction in the U S so we don't have
like the big haze culture that they do in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam where, where, you know,
it's super silver haze, amnesia,
[SPEAKER_03]: haze, everything over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cookies, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And slowly we're seeing that invade over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what we're going to see
for the future with hazes, but hopefully
[SPEAKER_03]: people keep working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also thought I'd mentioned that we have
talked about all these plants before,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I should say Matt and Notso have
definitely talked about all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and lines before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to go for a deeper dive,
you can definitely find the episodes where
[SPEAKER_00]: they cover the respective plants or lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just meant to be a summary,
an overview on each of these, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: with the particular lens of breeding with
them or working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in, in a lot of the previous
episodes, it's been a bit more about their
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance or sorry, much more driven by,
by their history with some, some aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else that we wanted to
add, especially considering this is still
[SPEAKER_00]: part of our like breeding series with,
with any follow-ups to any of the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing comes to mind directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any questions from anybody that
we needed to run through?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I may just mention that,
like, I saw some really cool conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the discord in and around
those episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know Squirrels, Scientist,
and maybe Crybaby were having a discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: about the actual findings in terms of the
occurrence of actual heterosis in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously so much more beyond what
we've outlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, definitely don't take our
stopping point for the stopping point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think Matt's already mentioned
before, you know, like whether,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you can find them in like journal
articles or, you know, agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding textbooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much knowledge out there that
we are still, you know, very far from
[SPEAKER_00]: fully digesting in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like just remember everything is
from certain perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I was telling the skunk one
tale, that was all done from someone
[SPEAKER_03]: else's perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis is just a big conglomeration
of different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the best we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't feel like, like he said,
don't feel like this is the end point.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best we know currently,
but it doesn't mean someone can't dig up
[SPEAKER_03]: research that we haven't and find out
things we haven't that we don't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope people are inspired to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to mention as well, we're still
trying to get high and low tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't able to get it going this week,
but hopefully soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need more stuff on this board,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still, we still haven't had the not so
clips yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you plant seeds, you number them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed one through 300 or one through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, skunk, gunk and
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reckon we can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can diversify the soundboard,
but we'll work on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess other than that,
check out riotseeds.com for all your seed
[SPEAKER_03]: needs and feminine spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget if you want to make your own
feminine seeds at home, it's an excellent
[SPEAKER_03]: way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the instructions on the site,
three different sizes available.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our Patreon discord where we hang
out all the time and exchange all kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think tonight, I don't even know if we
have time tonight, but we may try to do
[SPEAKER_03]: like a group, like horror video game type
thing with a few of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making all kinds of friends and not
just like, you know, acquaintances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're making lifelong friends there
with people that have the same passions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's not just like awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some of it's like life changing,
you know, and I think a lot of people feel
[SPEAKER_03]: that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm stoked on it and it, and I'm
honored to even be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm happy.
