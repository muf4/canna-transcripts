[SPEAKER_03]: with be real so Yeah There we go bringing
it mr..
[SPEAKER_03]: Fletcher
[SPEAKER_03]: So all your questions get ready to drop
them Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: You finally find a place to put it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of I'm trying hold on a sec You look
handsome as ever dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I'm not very well set up for this
social media shit Okay Yeah, so pre-98
[SPEAKER_00]: bubba is that what people yeah So in like
oh four oh five I was on cannabis world
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the green bubba the purple bubba
both from Ken organ kid and then I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaw bud who is 707 seed bank his bubba
Kush cut they were all called bubba Ken
[SPEAKER_00]: called the purple fino which was
supposedly an s1 That some club owner in
[SPEAKER_00]: the in the valley made It was really heavy
yielding made like club type nuggets with
[SPEAKER_00]: the rounded top yeah the katsu cut I As
far as I know and I can't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, but I'm pretty sure that was
the cut that he sold to katsu Right and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the green fino and then Shaw bud
aka 707 seed bank his his bubba cut was
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-98 and so basically what happened
is I had all three cuts I need to label
[SPEAKER_00]: them in my room so that I would could tell
the different or you know so I could
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain mothers and know which ones which
and it just got the name pre-98 because
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaw had Received the cutting in the wood
in The winter of 97 98 so at the time it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like 2003 I'm like what had to have been
before 1998 because someone popped the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and has a clone by now already It's
pre-98 right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got the name makes it um and
that was like 2004 and then it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four years later that swerve
basically Appropriated the name for
[SPEAKER_00]: selling seeds yeah So that's pretty much
all there is to it so wasn't anything
[SPEAKER_00]: special It wasn't there weren't anything
crazy about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the difference between shaw's and
like the katsu?
[SPEAKER_00]: They all pretty much smell the same the
purple was like a little bit more purple
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling But still the bubba with the
incense and the like the smell in the air
[SPEAKER_00]: the same meaty smell The katsu they would
all turn purple depending on how you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: them right, so they're all phenotypically
variable based on environment It was the
[SPEAKER_00]: green Fino was the the katsu which um It
would just tended to be green more often,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you overferred it didn't veg it
very big whatever It put out little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: buds it turned purple at the end of flower
with cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Not a major difference the pre-98
tended to be a little chunkier more often
[SPEAKER_00]: But still the same characteristics as the
other two cuts it would still Like
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what I call like big stem small
Bud yeah, right where you've given it too
[SPEAKER_00]: much cow mag or it doesn't have a big
enough root system for the size of Potts
[SPEAKER_00]: in whatever right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you vet it look just like most bubbles
if you vet your mouth really big they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start actually producing pretty good
That's fucking awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know about bubba Glad you
said that people were asking about the
[SPEAKER_03]: face-off story That would be fucking
awesome to hear like straight from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth So the real og kushman the source
genetics Chris Chris used to live up here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Seattle in 2000 and I think he lived up
here from like 02 to 06 I met him in like
[SPEAKER_00]: 04 and He was growing the poison og at the
time which was his bad seed Fino From bags
[SPEAKER_00]: that he had purchased in SoCal the
face-off was and I think he had 12 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: of face-off bag seeds The face-off was
never actually a clone that was being
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a moniker Given to a certain
batch of og that went through the Inland
[SPEAKER_00]: Empire back in like 99 or something like
that I got six of the seeds I think four
[SPEAKER_00]: or five of them popped if I remember right
the face-off number four is the cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have right I popped it from seed So
that's the only real face-off really I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, I think there's like four or five
more seeds out there Chris gave some to
[SPEAKER_00]: cult classic seeds, but I don't think you
Ever popped them and I'd be surprised if
[SPEAKER_00]: they even popped now being 20 years old
No, and I think Chris might have a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: more seeds of it, but that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome So like so I popped
the seeds it was the number four Fino the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one two and three the number one
was like a It like the leaves turned
[SPEAKER_00]: purple it had more of like a in between
Bubba and in face-off kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah The number two was like this really
short sativa Leaf looking thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it didn't stretch at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost like a dwarf plant,
but it had a really really thin blades The
[SPEAKER_00]: number three produced like much larger
bigger colas was a little bit hermy Which
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of the main reasons I didn't keep
it and it pretty much smelled like your
[SPEAKER_00]: typical og made with like a little bit of
a gummy bear funk and then the number four
[SPEAKER_00]: and And that the number three and the
number one kind of had that similar like
[SPEAKER_00]: gummy bear in between og and Bubba kind of
Smell the number three was more og Dom the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one was like it wasn't really Bubba
Dom I would say but it was just kind of I
[SPEAKER_00]: would call it blander, but you know it
wasn't anything particularly special and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the number four was the It's that
it's that face-off smell like that really
[SPEAKER_00]: long-lasting lingering after flavor and a
real cushy flavor and the main reason I
[SPEAKER_00]: kept it too was It's potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always potent like the first time I
was smoking it I rolled up a joint was
[SPEAKER_00]: driving to town and pick up some hydro
gear This is like 2006 and I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started getting like lightheaded in the
car and I was like, all right This thing's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty potent probably And anybody that
knows me knows I smoke a lot of herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I typically don't even comment on
Potency at all because I'm smoking 20 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah a day, you know between all the
different kinds of hashes and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: else so
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's um, it's super hard to work
with I mean it's um It's a really old
[SPEAKER_00]: strain from up here in the northwest
everybody that like if you're a Round in
[SPEAKER_00]: the late 80s 90s and 2000 early 2000
smoking weed up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought purple weed and it smelled like
the purple indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this really Really not it well,
it's not I mean it's pungent but it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: if you could think of what the purple what
purple smells like the color This is
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that purple smells like And
hold on a second, I'm gonna take a toke
[SPEAKER_00]: and then
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the cut in 2003 it was the very
first cut that I got basically that It
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't come with a name either So I got it
from my friend who had gotten a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: card at the time, which was pretty hard to
get And he had gotten the cut from some
[SPEAKER_00]: organ growers I had no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing some 97 Dutch passion
blueberry seeds at the time and I also had
[SPEAKER_00]: some Some other blueberry seeds,
I can't remember what they were I think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're from Canada one of the Canadian
blueberry crock is like, yeah one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those, you know, I can't think of the
company names, but you know shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas culture magic Not like BCC depot
but like Federation seeds all those guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't remember who it was that had like
the blueberry the blueberry nl5 all that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Do you ever try peak seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember peak, but I think this was
before peak seeds I think this was God I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't remember the name, but it'll come to
me in a second But basically I was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry at the time and when you cut up
clones of The purple indica it literally
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like berries kind of right had a
very berryish smell right from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning which is kind of that purple
smell to and So I was I didn't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: it was right I just I just knew that like
it kind of looked like the blueberry shit
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of like was calling it blueberry
for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't even flowered it yet So I didn't
even know I was just like I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry something or other By the time I
finished the cut I knew that it was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple strains from up here So we had
the UW perp Seattle perps Tacoma perps
[SPEAKER_00]: ultraviolet these were all basically the
same phenos or not the same phenos they
[SPEAKER_00]: were either variations of the same variety
or Hybrids of the same variety right which
[SPEAKER_00]: was basically the old purple from up here
And it was like pretty widespread and we
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that there was multiple different
cuts because you could um You could
[SPEAKER_00]: basically Like when you bought pounds of
it you'd get some bags that all smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: like the purple indica or like Ultraviolet
or whatever, but if you got the perps like
[SPEAKER_00]: from Tacoma it have like big 20 gram colas
in it right and Whenever you grew like or
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever you saw like ultraviolet nuggets
They didn't never have big nuggets,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was always small little ounce bags
of shit Yeah, and when I grew out the the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry or the unknown cut yeah
Basically I start I grew it a few times,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was like there's no way that this is
the Tacoma perp cutting I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's the UW perp I don't
really know what cut it is because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anything to reference it by In terms
of other cuts, so I called it purple
[SPEAKER_00]: indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was how I got its name right so
it became PI right and Basically you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there never really was a purple indica up
here as far as I know it was just the
[SPEAKER_00]: perps so And it's just a really really
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not tiny It's not like a door for
anything, but it's a very tight internode
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah Afghani plant Pretty much anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's twice my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: They immediately can identify it as the
old perp From up here Kindness cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: he's one of my buddies from back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He remembers it really well, too And and
that's what the PI was and it's it's lower
[SPEAKER_00]: potency You know 15 to 18 percent and
pretty much whatever you cross it to it
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces its potency, so Yeah, it's just
hard to work with from from the
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective of trying to Try to bring a
new variety up to modern-day standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know it's Sometimes you cross
stuff in and it like like cookies for
[SPEAKER_00]: example you cross it into stuff that makes
it really Frosty and purple which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: the market likes you cross the PI and it
makes it less frosty Dark purple and not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as potent, but the funny thing is
the potency is um is So subjective yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays that like back then the purple
indica We always called it shut up weed
[SPEAKER_00]: because anybody load a bomb toke or
whatever for they immediately just sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there and zone out So even though it
always tests significantly was lower in
[SPEAKER_00]: potency They're a lot of stuff it um it
definitely Would ring some people's bells
[SPEAKER_03]: sure sure that makes sense, dude You know
I've noticed a lot of these Lower potency
[SPEAKER_03]: strains are coming around more now since
since concentrates are much more in use
[SPEAKER_03]: and available Seems like they've got a
renewed life in them Yeah, a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean you know lower potency means
lower yields yeah as well right so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people are just trying to Get as
much bang for their buck especially from
[SPEAKER_00]: an economic perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh sure sure So what are you working on
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what a lot of people like
to know about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you working on now?
[SPEAKER_03]: You make fucking amazing shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dosey dough.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to top dosey dough I Mean it's
you know it's it's all personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm actually gonna pop all my old
seeds all everything from 10 or 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago this night Next round right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm remaking All the stock right of stuff
that's already I've already gone through
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm just gonna I'm gonna go back
to the drawing board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on I can't wait to fucking see
what you pull up through your collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even imagine Yeah, I mean shit
gets boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know to me yeah And that's why people
are like oh someone else made your shit
[SPEAKER_00]: before you could it's like dude I was
working on trying to find something new
[SPEAKER_00]: Not remaking shit just because people are
asking for it, so it's all personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference You know and what your
motivation is and it's all about I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody can make your shit before you if
they don't test it and release it Right
[SPEAKER_00]: like yeah, of course exactly if you're not
gonna work it at all I mean you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: it as fast as someone can sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically yeah, so You know dosey
dough took a while to make and remake
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's the ogkb is like a type 4
hermy that thing Hermes every which way
[SPEAKER_00]: You can possibly get so hybridizing into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got it at least search through the
population and look for lower instances of
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits Yep, and anybody that's not
or even doesn't even know about that
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously doesn't even probably grow their
own fucking seeds, so Yeah Everybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be fucking bombing you about
slurricane.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you if you want to tell I mean
dude I saw I can't make purple punch cross
[SPEAKER_00]: with dosey dough, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it Especially if it's a half
your line in the thing Right well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean yeah exactly and it's like well You
know if if people are mad about the name
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever the the funniest shit is
They're the ones complaining about patents
[SPEAKER_00]: on plants, but what trademark rights for
naming shit Yeah, it's you know you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't have your cake and eat it,
too You got to be one or the other because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how patents and trademarks work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not It's I mean you know I think
Hypocrisy is the the a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: motive, so whatever it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean miseducation leads to it,
and it's all right It's what the world is
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's very true What else you guys
got for him any other questions that are
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking you got him sitting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ask fucking lame-ass shit Yeah,
who wants to talk about purple punch
[SPEAKER_03]: anyways like seriously Let's talk about
some fucking historical shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what yeah HP 13 the most common
Misinformation about it is that it's g13
[SPEAKER_03]: hash plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people think that because of
fucking retards and have looked up
[SPEAKER_03]: anything Can you tell us about your
experience with HP 13?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something many people talk about
So I got the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was the one that got it first
But I had seen it earlier for example like
[SPEAKER_00]: in you were talking about Jason King's
Canna Bible earlier So the Canna Bible
[SPEAKER_00]: entry that was my herb The Trinity crossed
with UW that was herb that I had purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: that I showed this to Jason King at the
2002 Seattle Hempfest The dog shit that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in there that was us not the humble
Outdoor pictures, but the pictures of the
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor that was my buddy cannabis reverend
yeah through another glassblower friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: ours that grew it That was the dog shit
entry that was in there The purple indica
[SPEAKER_00]: entry that was mine and then Scott Reach
also reached out to Jason King And I think
[SPEAKER_00]: showed him pictures of it, but that cut
came for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave Scott that back in the day and So
the first time I saw HP 13 was in 2004 I
[SPEAKER_00]: went to stay with a friend of mine in Hana
right and he's he was a dude another dude
[SPEAKER_00]: that was on cannabis world and He he
invited me to come out to this party right
[SPEAKER_00]: now I won't tell too much about the party
even though they don't throw it anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was basically a weed gathering
party another another couple buddies of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine that currently live on Maui And it
was basically like it was deep in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was off grid So there's there's no I
mean they had power because it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-millionaire's home that was this
thing getting thrown at so they had
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerators and all the nines,
but was actually an off-grid home and You
[SPEAKER_00]: know they had like kava leaf blunts and
fucking homemade kombucha and like
[SPEAKER_00]: homemade beer and all kinds of shit and
Jason King also happened to be there that
[SPEAKER_00]: was the first time I saw Mendo perps also
that was like 2004 I believe you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004 and So HP 13 I'd heard about it
everybody had talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some jungle-grown HP 13 That was
grown deep in the jungle there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I thought it was swag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, but it was just poorly grown
I thought it had a really unique smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it had like no stickiness to the resin
the smell I had to really mash it up
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was that outdoor shit and But
you could tell it had like a unique smell
[SPEAKER_00]: to it and then I eventually got the cut
from CSI Humboldt and I think that was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably around 2007 or eight was the
first time I got it from him and It's it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like it's a weird plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's it's pretty leafy Very
columnar growth just like goes straight up
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't branch very much small yield and
definitely her meat on the bottoms and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where like the pea or the Fuck what
do they call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The the sour pea was a sour diesel HP 13
cross That was all the same group of cats
[SPEAKER_00]: that did this Maui party every year back
then and I still have some friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: those parties that that live all over and
you know they they remember the stuff one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the one of the most impressive examples
that I remembered was the Jasmine Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: which came out of Eugene And that was it
was real hazy smelling but at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: like in Seattle Hazy stuff was like where
it was at that's why the dog shit the
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi Northern Lights haze that I made
that NL Hayes f2s the pure Malawi gold
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had the super bill all that shit
was Was super that was like what was
[SPEAKER_00]: popular like I remember when I first got
og up here from Chris Nobody even gave a
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck people were like dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just some indica bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right They didn't even care couldn't
get anything more for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really even it was it was pointless
Yeah, I just was growing it cuz I liked it
[SPEAKER_00]: right it wasn't you know like an 030 405
og wasn't really that popular or known
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah That's so dude I can't ever get
anybody knowledgeable to compact or to
[SPEAKER_03]: comment on HP 13 and it seems like
everybody who grows it or has grown it has
[SPEAKER_03]: different opinions on whether it's worth
keeping whether it's worth growing but
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty fascinating dude,
and I appreciate that Yeah the the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know it came from the people that
Jason King saw it from originally the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that put it in the Canna Bible
Those dudes were from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from New York right it is from New
York then for sure That's my understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: like I the the farthest back that I have
any experience with it and the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: it came from They had a New York
connection and that's where that cut came
[SPEAKER_03]: from Wow, okay cool Yeah, I've always
wondered because you always see it in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and Maui New York Yeah, that's why
they had the sour D out there too right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time that was all the same group
of people and You know the scene was
[SPEAKER_00]: really small 15 20 years ago, especially
Genetics scene back then because most
[SPEAKER_00]: people all they gave a shit about was just
finding one good cut Ain't running it till
[SPEAKER_00]: the wheels fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like the deal No, it didn't
really matter what the strain name was in
[SPEAKER_00]: those days because everything sold for
great money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh sure sure I've seen him fucking growing
in Maui growing fucking plants and trees
[SPEAKER_03]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking gnarly out there Yeah,
that was how that HP 13 that I first saw
[SPEAKER_00]: was grown and it was garbage Honestly,
it was pretty much garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's I would be nice about it But
it dudes Ryan's trying shit in the jungle
[SPEAKER_00]: is impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looked like I remember I would
ship out a jar weed like I shipped out a
[SPEAKER_00]: jar of Albert Walker for that party in
2004 and literally as soon as I opened
[SPEAKER_00]: that jar my buddy's house the weed got wet
Yeah, you know it was like cured perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: and was like spongy with the with the
crack as soon as you open the jars It
[SPEAKER_00]: turns into like jungle weed It's like 98%
humidity or 100% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like raining basically, so As soon as
you open the jar just takes it it takes it
[SPEAKER_03]: all on Are you doing any more dog shit
work someone wants to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing any more DS work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not popular enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's longer flowering I'll play with it
every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's actually hard to hybridize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw rich in here earlier also talking
about his dog walker and The scooby snacks
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that people like to make a big deal
out of yeah, and like every rich and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have mutual friends I didn't do it as any
intentional thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was living in LA at the time had no idea
that there was I don't even know this was
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012 so I don't even know if rich had Made
it or soul or giving it to people or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but literally I just made cookies
crossed with fucking Cookies crossed the
[SPEAKER_00]: face on I called it snooze the scooby
snacks and honestly it didn't even really
[SPEAKER_00]: sell very well, and I didn't expect I had
no idea until I moved back up to Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: And then started working with my buddy in
Oregon Did I even know that there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: cut out there called snooby sacks?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean Is that what the dog walker cuts
called scooby snacks?
[SPEAKER_00]: No dog scooby snacks is dog walker and I
didn't know that either Yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm you know, we're just still in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he can uh He can tell everybody
but yeah the dog walker, which is our
[SPEAKER_00]: walker og I'm not I'm not sure who made
that side of it And then that hybridized
[SPEAKER_00]: with chem 91 or chem 4 I can't remember if
rich found out which one it is I think he
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up saying chem 4 is what he was
Yeah, yeah, so I think it was supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be chem 91 ended up being chem 4 I
personally Prefer the flavor of chem 4 so
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah It makes even more sense why I like
smoking dog walker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my favorite question Are you going
to breed any more land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mean why are you gonna like it a land
race?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, why would I even try I'm
gonna move to Antarctica and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: first Antarctic land race
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Well, I mean if this means I have to
stop trying to Answer this shit with my
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers That would be helpful I mean,
I've tried so for you know this Matt I've
[SPEAKER_00]: tried for so many years to try to just
keep the information correct I mean it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another Guy that heard something
about the ocean grown story from fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Paradise Seeds mod John the biggest
fucking scammer ever Which can organ kid
[SPEAKER_03]: could come on here and tell everybody
about that's the same fucking dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of yeah That's him right
exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all him every story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ever told was a lie I got so many
stories about that guy because he lived in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland, and I fucking knew him
personally You know him and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew him in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Wendy I want to say Man that dude
would like I don't even know if he had a
[SPEAKER_03]: wife really you know It was a chick on
meth that used to fucking smoke meth with
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what I know Dude, he used to
have like strip like stripper hooker
[SPEAKER_00]: whores and shit around all the time like
he had a whole that dude It was a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I made him cry once, but he was
he was how I ended up meeting Ken though,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that yeah, because he was
selling Ken seeds at the time right Yep,
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that's where West Coast dog was
that great again West Coast dog was that a
[SPEAKER_03]: John creation?
[SPEAKER_00]: No that came from Ken also Yeah,
West Coast dog So So John used to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically find medical patients They get
them to make seeds for that seeds for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd take the seeds and not pay him
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so he had a couple bucks I do know
Ken who are not Ken Westfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not who we're talking about,
but Ken Ken Doe who's the guy that's
[SPEAKER_00]: posting there?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also in our circle of friends But not
the huh Yeah, I know Ken Doe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's old school too, but this this
someone was asking if it's Ken Doe that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about and the answer is no
This is totally different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and So John used to get these guys
one of the dudes name was diamond who's
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy that's responsible for the Udub
cut Yeah, that's on the long line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Udub First first of all it was a
nice hash plant, but it had no smell of
[SPEAKER_00]: any Udub I ever bought buying pounds out
of Udub There's many different strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out Udub, but none of them I
ever saw was that one So there's diamond
[SPEAKER_00]: in his buddy Jim right and Ken Ken
remembers all these guys too and so Ken
[SPEAKER_00]: gave those dudes the cuts and I got those
cuts from them and that was like the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: og the ogres The the cutting that ended up
being called the smelly it all that shit I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to know personally about who named
banana og it was a cut of og's right or
[SPEAKER_00]: ogres Ken named all that Ken named and
selected all that okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: He he had gotten Sagar Martha's 6040 seeds
As freebies with shit that he had ordered
[SPEAKER_00]: from gypsy nirvana gotcha and He liked
that and crossed it into the og and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: banana og it was a freebie packs from
gypsy It was just bulk like basically
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk number one hybrids Because that's
what I mean I think Sam the skunk man was
[SPEAKER_00]: selling like millions of skunk one hybrids
back in those days to all the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor guys yeah, and They would all
just like package it up and sell it give
[SPEAKER_00]: it away as freebies or whatever it was you
know and Yeah, it was just that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: is that cross with ogres and then Ken grit
So it's probably one of Sam's skunk one
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids as the 6040 based on the smell and
and like the way the plant grows the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it washes well all that stuff Leads
me to believe that it's probably Probably
[SPEAKER_00]: some skunk number one cross just like
pretty much Everything else that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown from that era from Amsterdam our
buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nick Vitis is asking about Norcal cap this
that's a shot one right yeah, that's job,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a high school weed from the early 90s
That's fucked up, and then the so Cal the
[SPEAKER_00]: so Cal cap this is a cut that I got from
This dude that used to go by the name
[SPEAKER_00]: Philly he used to run a lot of weight up
here There's a lot of local people up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle that will know who I'm talking
about if they were around back then and he
[SPEAKER_00]: brought me Those cut I did a bunch of work
for him And I actually heard that he's he
[SPEAKER_00]: was at the glass show like last year down
in Vegas It was like a random connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be actually have his phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant to hit him up, but You know I
haven't I haven't talked to the guy in a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, and he had some uh He had some
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put it that way with the with
the law So I you know and I was really I
[SPEAKER_00]: was always really paranoid so So you know
but but him and I filling I have some
[SPEAKER_00]: funny stories Just like of shit that shit
that happened like I borrowed money from
[SPEAKER_00]: him to get started in my first spot When I
bought my own first I had those Omega
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardens that spin around the ball the bulb
and shit Yeah, so I borrowed some money
[SPEAKER_00]: from him to get going on that right and I
ended up with like three of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but so anyways I did like some work
for them and moved some stuff and did
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and They brought me a couple big
mother plants straight from San Diego of
[SPEAKER_00]: that cut right and I remember just like
cutting up like three there was two I
[SPEAKER_00]: never I've still this day probably haven't
seen plants this healthy They were just
[SPEAKER_00]: like six inch Rockwell blocks with mats of
roots that were like three feet long right
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like they were doing that where you
cover with panda film over top of the the
[SPEAKER_00]: tray Yeah, it was just like perfect white
roots these things that just you know been
[SPEAKER_00]: in the back seat and I probably took like
350 cuts off of those two plants You know
[SPEAKER_00]: they were like covered in clones and
anybody that's grown that San Diego campus
[SPEAKER_00]: cut Yeah We'll know how branchy that thing
is I mean it puts off cuts like crazy so
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, that's how I got that cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a legendary strain in San Diego
along with the hogs breath P91 in the bull
[SPEAKER_03]: run Do you ever come across the original
bull rider?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw any of those other ones man I
only ever saw the cat piss right and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like oh For that I got the cat piss
from Philly Yeah, and cannabis Reverend
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy the dot my dog shit buddy and our
other buddy I don't know if he wants to be
[SPEAKER_00]: caught So I'll ask him in the future if he
wants everybody know who brought our
[SPEAKER_00]: brought our crew the dog shit But there's
also the the farthest back that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that the dog shit goes is My buddy down in
Portland that owns five zero trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got it in 94 and supposedly it came
from like Michigan I think Michigan or
[SPEAKER_00]: midst and it was originally called
electric Boogaloo That's a story that my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy that owns five zero trees that those
group of stores down in Portland they were
[SPEAKER_00]: the first ones that That got that cut that
that I know of and that's where that's
[SPEAKER_03]: where they say it came from and Your
thoughts on Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Only ever bought the herb from from
Eugene I didn't ever see like the I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: never see the cut or know anybody that had
the cut directly All I remember about it
[SPEAKER_00]: was really was that it had like a root
that I saw a couple different phenos of it
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what the fuck I actually saw
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of them were like very burnt
rubber smelling They weren't like skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, like that burnt rubber cushy Afghani
smell I don't remember them tasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really well grown, but I don't
remember it tasting Better than Than it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled I remember being the opposite it's
smelling really good and not really having
[SPEAKER_03]: a ton of flavor the Trinity cut that I've
been smoking that came through like that
[SPEAKER_03]: And those guys have and Caleb that one
that one kind of tasted me like the old
[SPEAKER_03]: Elvis cut which is real interesting I'm
not sure if it is the old Trinity or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I they're saying it is Yeah,
I haven't I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really don't know the Like I said the
Trinity that I remember all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled like straight burnt rubber Afghani
funk and it was pretty strong smelling but
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no sweetness at all to it there
was no fruitiness there was no like Off
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it was just basically burnt rubber I
think if people confuse that anything
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not sweet, but that's funky with
skunk I've been seeing that a lot lately
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call skunk But there's I think it
also has to do with like I know when I've
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped smoking for periods of months and
stuff Everything smells way skunk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, like og smells like skunk ken
sour cush that thing was fucking super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky I mean like if you think GMO has
that bad breath, whatever smell to ask ask
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask about the original sour kush cut that
organ kid can put out there that thing was
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Ridiculous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean comparatively it shits on GMO in
terms of that Wow raw Palatosis og funk,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is totally different than the
burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean It's just experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to have Seen it to know
the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's everything Blue dot
707 seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows more about that than anybody I
mean that was like a club cut that used to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the third floor in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I remember about it I've seen
some blue dot over the years, but whether
[SPEAKER_00]: or not it was like The blue dot that
everybody talks about I have no clue right
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that I saw wasn't that impressive
So it leads me to believe that either
[SPEAKER_00]: people are smoking BAM or weed or I got
the wrong I saw the wrong shit You never
[SPEAKER_00]: know Yeah, well, I mean I've been fooled
before so yeah, I think all of us have at
[SPEAKER_00]: some point Yeah, or someone said
something's really awesome and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: see it and you're just kind of like never
mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah See what else you guys got the Maui
Pog you familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything with about the Pog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a HP 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say the Yeah, I mean I've heard
like a bunch of different stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've never really seen enough about it
the Oregon pineapple someone said I Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember buying that herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing the pineapple DS I
remember it reminding me of the Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica shit that was going around Yeah,
and that's what it rumored to be and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that you know that Hawaiian Indica
line was like pretty popular there for a
[SPEAKER_03]: few years What here's a good one and we
can end with this this thing's almost over
[SPEAKER_03]: What what project are you most proud of
like looking back on what you've done to
[SPEAKER_03]: this point?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you most proud of oh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm just one cog in the wheel like
I'm not I just was preserving genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: because I thought it was important and at
the time A lot of other people were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of everything because it was
starting to become like a marketing game
[SPEAKER_00]: right it used to be able to Grow dog shit,
and it's still sell in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the most in-demand product Yeah,
ten years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the opposite right nobody wanted a
long farm sativa's and people didn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking them anymore It had become more of
a marketing type of cannabis market than
[SPEAKER_00]: it was before right Yeah, and so for me is
I I'm just happy that I was in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: place at the right time was able to get a
lot of these really good cuts and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: put them all in one place and make sure
That they they stuck around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's it One more quick one your
collab the tie with with with costas Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was Chris's brother's cut he lived in
Portland Chris gave me that cut when he I
[SPEAKER_00]: think when he moved back or actually I
think I got it from his buddy up here a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years after he moved back to LA
something like that and I Seated it up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never sold seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But I made seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Albert Walker face or Albert Walker
manic crossed with that tie also And I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave Chris a handful of those seeds And
he's gonna work it just partly an homage
[SPEAKER_00]: to his brother that tie was really
interesting it definitely it was like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like bubblegum and burnt onion or not
burnt onion, but like like a really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting onion smell and Bubble gum and
like a little bit of the super silver haze
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah hazy back end, but not not really
like when you smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly that like a tropical cut onion
Type of smell so it's pretty unique then
[SPEAKER_00]: oh It's super unique and it was it was
stunk and I mean it did like the classic
[SPEAKER_00]: little bananas all up the calyxes up the
top colas when it Finished up just like
[SPEAKER_00]: the milling too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep Well, hey, dude, we actually did this
