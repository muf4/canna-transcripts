[SPEAKER_03]: Quick 999 donation from Carl Bobby's got a
question for you Danny and it's has mr
[SPEAKER_03]: Sheehan personally seen enough evidence
Testimony to be convinced the UAP issue is
[SPEAKER_03]: extraterrestrial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can he say anything about the most
convincing evidence?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks amazing show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely There are two there are
two specific things that have that have
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced me the most One of them was back
in 1977 when I was asked by the
[SPEAKER_00]: congressional research service science and
technology division to be special counsel
[SPEAKER_00]: to their their investigation of the UFO
and ET phenomenon at the request of
[SPEAKER_00]: President Carter after he was elected that
he was denied access to this information
[SPEAKER_00]: and by George HW Bush who was at that time
the director of the Central Intelligence
[SPEAKER_00]: Agency and President Carter Commissioned a
major secret study to be done by the
[SPEAKER_00]: congressional research service the science
and technology division I was contacted by
[SPEAKER_00]: Marsha Smith who was the director of that
project and And asked initially if I could
[SPEAKER_00]: Get at the information that was in the
Vatican Archives because I was legal
[SPEAKER_00]: counsel the Jesuit National Headquarters
in their office of social ministry their
[SPEAKER_00]: public policy office When that when we
were unable to get that information I was
[SPEAKER_00]: later asked by Marsha to go and deliver a
closed-door three-hour presentation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top 50 scientists of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory the SETI program on the
[SPEAKER_00]: theological implications Of contact with
an extraterrestrial civilization because
[SPEAKER_00]: of my position at the Jesuit headquarters
in that context I asked Marsha Smith if we
[SPEAKER_00]: could get at the classified portions of
Project Blue Book So I could use that to
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare this this presentation that I was
asked to make to the top scientists in
[SPEAKER_00]: SETI and it was in that context that I
actually physically got access to the
[SPEAKER_00]: classified portions of Project Blue Book
and I saw photographs not just photographs
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sky of some bright light jiggling
around or not even a Some kind of a craft
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like you could kind of doctor
it in the sky, but this was a crashed UFO
[SPEAKER_00]: Saucer there wasn't any doubt about it
that it had the photographs of I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: several photographs of it plowed through
this field that was covered with snow was
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck in the side of an embankment and it
was it was actually being photographed by
[SPEAKER_00]: US Air Force personnel and with cameras
and stuff all around it in the photographs
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was actually Able to trace the
markings on the side on the dome part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this saucer that were nothing they were
not any kind of planetary Language at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a set of symbols that were on
the side of the Dome of this craft and so
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that and so I knew perfectly well
that that was true and I brought it back
[SPEAKER_00]: to Jesuit headquarters and I showed it to
Father William J Davis who was my Jesuit
[SPEAKER_00]: superior at the at the headquarters of the
Jesuit order and He reached down and slid
[SPEAKER_00]: open a drawer in his desk and took out a
little Manila folder and handed it to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and I unlatched it and I pulled it out and
it was a little Eight and a half by eleven
[SPEAKER_00]: the black and white glossy photograph of a
UFO You know perfectly clear that it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: UFO and I said where did you get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said well my sister Doty gave it to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, where did Doty get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: She said her husband Michael gave it to
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the air traffic controller up in
Seattle, Washington and his best friend
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a commercial pilot took this
photograph out of the cockpit window of a
[SPEAKER_00]: UFO that was that was tracking his plane
in and He the pilot didn't want to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: any trouble about this by reporting it
officially So he said look I'm gonna bring
[SPEAKER_00]: it to my best friend Mike who is the air
traffic controller here in Seattle?
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave him the copy of the photo and
Michael didn't want to get in trouble by
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting it So he took it and gave it to
Doty his wife and he said here Doty Take
[SPEAKER_00]: this and give it to your brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a priest So Billy Billy Billy kept
this in his desk and then when I showed
[SPEAKER_00]: him what I had found in the art in the
project blue book He showed me that photo
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the two instances in
which I was convinced that this was real
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one was it Roswell that I had I
had Must have been 1995 96 something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the process of representing dr.
John Mack and Harvard University who was
[SPEAKER_00]: in this well-known confrontation with the
Harvard faculty over the fact that he had
[SPEAKER_00]: published this book called abductions
Human contact with aliens Etc in that
[SPEAKER_00]: context I was invited to go to the
International UFO Congress out in
[SPEAKER_00]: Laughlin, Nevada To do a presentation to
give them an update on how we were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the litigation And so a guy came up out
of the audience and said to me mr Sheehan
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to meet with you about something
really important and so I did I met With
[SPEAKER_00]: him with another fellow and I sat down
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said look I think I have found the
photographer who took that famous
[SPEAKER_00]: photograph of general Ramey You know
kneeling down in form of that the balloon
[SPEAKER_00]: wreckage, you know, the weather balloon
wreckage He said and I had noticed in that
[SPEAKER_00]: that that photograph I kept saying look at
what is that that Ramey has in his hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some kind of a telegram or
something in his hand and and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about that many times and when the
guy said look I think I found the
[SPEAKER_00]: photographer that I said look at If you
can do that find out if that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: photographer and see if there's any chance
that he still has the original negatives
[SPEAKER_00]: of the photographs that he took that night
on July 9th late night of July 8th and
[SPEAKER_00]: early morning of July 9th in 1947 if he
still has them I know some people we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get some financing and we can digitize
those negatives and get them blown up and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see if we can read that telegram
that Ramey has in his hand and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: turns out that he tracked a guy down and
it was the photographer he did have the
[SPEAKER_00]: negatives we got the negatives digitized
and blown up and you could read the
[SPEAKER_00]: telegram and we actually subjected it to
to a computer analysis so where some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the places where there were creases in the
in the telegram that you couldn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: tell what the letter was in the work that
we subjected it to a computer that could
[SPEAKER_00]: tell whether it you know it was a
consonant or a vowel or whatever it was
[SPEAKER_00]: and we reconstructed that and it said you
know take the disc to right field and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the the bodies of the crash victims
and it said that in the telegram that
[SPEAKER_00]: Ramey had in his hand not thinking that in
a thousand years that anybody would ever
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to read it and the dumb guy
brought it with him and got the photograph
[SPEAKER_00]: taken of him standing there holding in his
hand so I said look at here are the two
[SPEAKER_00]: things these are the two most convincing
pieces of evidence I can tell you this if
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that evidence in front of an
American jury the jury would conclude
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond any reasonable doubt that the UFOs
were real and that those bodies that were
[SPEAKER_00]: recovered there in in Roswell were from an
extraterrestrial civilization so those are
[SPEAKER_00]: the two pieces of evidence that I thought
personally were the most convincing for me
[SPEAKER_03]: okay so real quick Andy wanted to ask a
follow-up question on something he said
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we've got a five dollar donation
that has a question for John and I also
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to get John's thoughts on whoever's
phones going off if you could silence it
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be great no worries either way
I know people are busy but real quick John
[SPEAKER_03]: let's bring you in because I wanted you I
wanted to hear sort of your rebuttal to
[SPEAKER_03]: the the two pieces of evidence that Danny
found it would be you know the most
[SPEAKER_03]: convincing and then we've also got a quick
question here for you well you're muted
[SPEAKER_02]: John so we definitely know it's not your
dings I laughed at rebuttal that you
[SPEAKER_02]: automatically assume that I guess so
you're gonna so there's a lot to unpack
[SPEAKER_02]: there I I'm gonna start with the latter
piece of evidence first and I'm gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask for a respectful reminder on the
first part the letter walking into a
[SPEAKER_02]: courtroom with a artificial intelligence I
would say filling in the gaps you know to
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of quickly summer it Danny I've
known you a long time so I mean no
[SPEAKER_02]: disrespect and to say that I would
respectfully disagree with a an attorney
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm not an attorney makes me a little
uncomfortable but I think I would
[SPEAKER_02]: respectfully disagree in the sense that if
you showed a jury that that you had to get
[SPEAKER_02]: a computer to fill in the blanks they
would say you'd have to do better and and
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we would need to really
dissect the claims of you know what it was
[SPEAKER_02]: about Roswell but sadly I think there are
so many holes in the Roswell story at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point we've lost all the witnesses so now
we're going on messy second third and even
[SPEAKER_02]: fourth hand information of he said she
said that's challenging in a courtroom and
[SPEAKER_02]: and I often often liken this debate away
from Roswell but UFOs and UAPs as a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: as stepping into a courtroom improving
your case and I I've had to do that in
[SPEAKER_02]: FOIA appeals now hundreds and hundreds of
times I've done 10,000 plus FOIAs in 25
[SPEAKER_02]: years appeals I have no idea to be honest
with you how many I've done it's
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely not thousands though just just
simply because it took me years to realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that the appeal process actually does work
and I always recommend people to do it so
[SPEAKER_02]: I've appealed a lot more but when you get
to the appeal process then you get into
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially making your case when you file
a FOIA it could be a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: phishing expedition when you do an appeal
process you got to sit down and lay out
[SPEAKER_02]: the evidence of why you're challenging a
final determination and so the very wee
[SPEAKER_02]: little experience I've had with that
aspect of it that's just where I would
[SPEAKER_02]: respectfully disagree about that latter
piece of the evidence happy to address the
[SPEAKER_03]: first part but I'll be honest with you I'm
just drawing a blank on what the appeal
[SPEAKER_03]: process is all right well there was two
things that kind of came up in the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation between everybody that just
went is remember that there's two
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of lies that you're gonna
deal with with the government you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be ones that are blatant just to cover up
some a blunder or some type of mishap or
[SPEAKER_01]: just something they just don't want to get
out then you also have lies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately actually necessary for
national security and things like that and
[SPEAKER_01]: these lies are just to as you know counter
espionage things like that so you know our
[SPEAKER_01]: job is to be able to pick through that
data find what's not gonna cause the most
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible horrendous things and then you
know get our answers and the other thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is is Danny said that he had access to all
the there the project bluebook files along
[SPEAKER_01]: with the pictures did you have the access
to the associated documents with those
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures to get a clear work with it and
the reports that describe the crash in
[SPEAKER_00]: detail yeah no it's it's a it was one of
those mistakes I've made in the past one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them once I got the photographs and I
saw the different photographs there were
[SPEAKER_00]: like three or four of the photographs from
different angles etc and and you can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: that the that the Air Force personnel that
were all around them were kind of stunned
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were taking these photographs in
this kind of excited way about this crap
[SPEAKER_00]: and as I say the key was that the symbols
that were around the edge of the dome were
[SPEAKER_00]: symbols that were were not anything they
weren't any kind of English or Russian or
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese or any kind of hieroglyphics or
anything they were a completely unique set
[SPEAKER_00]: of symbols that were all around the edge
of this this the dome of this thing which
[SPEAKER_00]: led me to believe that look this is not
any language that I've ever seen or
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere near anything on our planet
that's what caused me to to think that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then one of the problems was that once I
they told me that I was not allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: take any notes or or anything else in the
in the room with the documents I did and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of an infamous story now but I
had this yellow pad with me that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: under my arm I I opened it up in on the
inside cardboard of the yellow pad I
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced the the picture from this film
film strip thing that I had this from what
[SPEAKER_00]: they call this little machine the
microfiche machine that that I was losing
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the the documents and what I did is
I traced the exact letters that were in
[SPEAKER_00]: this around the dome of this thing and I
closed it up and because I knew that I I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: done something that they were I was gonna
get in big trouble if I tried doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: what I did is I I put it under my arm and
I walked out of the place really fast to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of there because I thought that
this was kind of dispositive and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked myself a thousand times between
then 1977 and now I should have stayed
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I should have started taking
some notes on any of the documents that
[SPEAKER_00]: were around they referred to that but I
didn't so I I had the I saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs and I saw the the letters and
I copied the letters and then I left and
[SPEAKER_00]: so the the the short answer to that is I
didn't go digging into all the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: documents not only that there was tons of
other stuff there I mean it was a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room like by you know maybe 20 feet wide
by 15 feet deep and they had these these
[SPEAKER_00]: folding tables with these boxes these look
like big shoebox sized things with these
[SPEAKER_00]: canisters of microfiche and then it was as
soon as I hit that particular set of
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs I since I was able to copy the
letters around the top of the dome or the
[SPEAKER_00]: edge of the dome of that that crap that I
just got up and left and that was a big
[SPEAKER_03]: mistake is that is that tracing available
anywhere have you made that yeah have you
[SPEAKER_00]: framed that I brought it back to the
Jesuit headquarters and I put it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: files with the Jesuit headquarters and
when I left the Jesuit headquarters I took
[SPEAKER_00]: my files with me and when we we left we
were doing the big Iran conflict case this
[SPEAKER_00]: big case that we had dealing with the the
off-the-shelf enterprise and there there
[SPEAKER_00]: was an attempt on the part of Jack
Singlaub who was the president of the
[SPEAKER_00]: World Anti-Communist League and and and
Green and these other guys that were the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers for Oliver North and the other
guys they were trying to get a hold of our
[SPEAKER_00]: documents so what we did is we we stacked
up our documents in this big 18 wheeler
[SPEAKER_00]: and moved them to California and actually
put them in a in a a storage facility out
[SPEAKER_00]: there out by the Inland Empire here in
California and there was this huge massive
[SPEAKER_00]: storm this sounds like one of those dumb
fucking excuses you'd hear is someone on
[SPEAKER_00]: the stand and you turned in Durango yeah
right you know but but the fact is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was this big flood and they flooded
part of the documents that we had stored I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know for years which ones they were
but when we took the documents out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there and moved them to Jackson Brown's
ranch where we had them for years when I
[SPEAKER_00]: finally went looking for that particular
file a whole section of our Jesuit files
[SPEAKER_00]: are the ones that got flooded out and then
the people at the at the storage facility
[SPEAKER_00]: had just thrown them out and never even
told us about it never even gave us an
[SPEAKER_00]: option to look at them but I've concluded
over the years that had to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the documents that got flooded out
so we don't have them but Jamar I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring you in here real quick because I
haven't heard that beautiful face yet of
[SPEAKER_02]: what I want to add to that though is the
fact that there is such a counter
[SPEAKER_02]: intelligence value to the UAP topic that
regardless of if there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: extraterrestrial connection or not and I
and I do believe that that's a big
[SPEAKER_02]: possibility for a portion of what we're
dealing with the stuff that is not
[SPEAKER_02]: extraterrestrial connected can absolutely
be utilized by the intelligence community
[SPEAKER_02]: and counterintelligence operatives
whatever you want to say as a way to muddy
[SPEAKER_02]: the public perception of what we are
dealing with and it costs the government
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing because the general public will
take just a little tiny nugget and blow it
[SPEAKER_02]: into something that it's not so the the
answer is it extraterrestrially connected
[SPEAKER_02]: or not then becomes irrelevant because the
portion that definitely isn't they can use
[SPEAKER_02]: it and start throwing things out there
like oh yeah we're totally we're totally
[SPEAKER_02]: clueless and I point to the official
inside communication of the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: Air Force obtained through FOIA that
talked about the all with clearance
[SPEAKER_02]: holders and public affairs offices and so
on it was the internal communications that
[SPEAKER_02]: the Navy put out the statement to me in
September of 2019 that they had no idea
[SPEAKER_02]: what those videos were first time they
ever acknowledged that and then when you
[SPEAKER_02]: juxtapose that with the Air Force
internally and again these were not public
[SPEAKER_02]: statements I had to fight for the
documents internally the Air Force is
[SPEAKER_02]: going yeah the Navy says they're
unidentified but we're talking about UAS's
[SPEAKER_02]: and drones and the media turns it into
UFO's and aliens and it really gives an
[SPEAKER_02]: insight that number one military agencies
don't really know what the other one
[SPEAKER_02]: thinks does or they agree with each other
but number two look at the value of that
[SPEAKER_02]: because now we don't know as the general
public we just don't know what to believe
[SPEAKER_02]: is it alien is it not could it be could it
be do they have the answers do they not
[SPEAKER_02]: and again that CI value the
counterintelligence value of this topic
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not it's alien is something
that they're going to utilize so that I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe Jamal if that that answers your
question that they will use that to their
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage because in the process it
confuses Russia it confuses China it may
[SPEAKER_02]: confuse Iran it will confuse all of the
powers that either we are trying to play
[SPEAKER_02]: nice in the sandbox with or we're not it
confuses all of them to wait a minute does
[SPEAKER_02]: their intelligence community really not
realize that that's a balloon or that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: drone or wait a minute that's us they're
really clueless again it's that confusion
[SPEAKER_02]: from the CI perspective that I think is I
mean is what's going on capacity to to
[SPEAKER_00]: seek information that is classified and
they can seek the authority to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: declassified so they can have access to it
and and this was undertaken by the
[SPEAKER_00]: congressional research service science and
technology division at my request as
[SPEAKER_00]: special counsel to them and that Marsha
Smith who was the head of the science and
[SPEAKER_00]: technology division of the of the
congressional research service when I put
[SPEAKER_00]: the request to her to have that get access
to the classified portions of project blue
[SPEAKER_00]: book she just came back to me a couple
weeks later totally surprised that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had agreed to do this that when I asked
her to see if we could get access to it so
[SPEAKER_00]: I could help prepare this presentation to
the SETI program at the Jet Propulsion
[SPEAKER_00]: Laboratory in Pasadena California we she
didn't think they were going to agree to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it and so she was surprised that they
had agreed to this and so she simply told
[SPEAKER_00]: me yes I had a right to come and see this
I had to bring two forms of photo
[SPEAKER_00]: identification and I went over to the the
Madison building which was the brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: wing of the Library of Congress and they
had delivered this these files and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were in this room downstairs in the
basement of the Madison building and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was nobody even there it wasn't even open
yet it was brand new it just been built
[SPEAKER_00]: and so when I went in there were two suits
that were standing in front of the door
[SPEAKER_00]: when I arrived who checked out my passport
and my driver's license and then I was
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed into the building and I went down
the hall into an elevator they pointed out
[SPEAKER_00]: and went down into the basement and there
were these other two suits in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: this room and and I don't I don't know you
know exactly what agencies they were from
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know you know but I've never got a
clearance that I because Bob Fink who was
[SPEAKER_00]: the the chief investigator for Bella Abzug
who was the congresswoman from New York
[SPEAKER_00]: who chaired the Senate or the House
Judiciary Committee subcommittee on human
[SPEAKER_00]: rights always said to me said do not ever
accept a classification security clearance
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can find out virtually
anything you want to know without doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got the kind of contacts you
got the kind of access to people you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have that because what they'll do
is attribute everything that you've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered from any other source they'll
attribute it to your security clearance
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll stop you from talking about it
publicly so I've refused to accept a
[SPEAKER_00]: security clearance you know and so that I
didn't get a clearance to see I have to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask so if you didn't because I know judges
and an attorney sometimes get the
[SPEAKER_02]: in-camera clearances so if you shut that
down okay how can CRS divulge or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: agencies were in the hallway divulge
classified information and that's okay
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't I did well no they they
brought classified records to you right
[SPEAKER_00]: you said boxes they brought them they
brought them to the Library of Congress
[SPEAKER_00]: they were over the Library of Congress at
the Madison building downstairs in the
[SPEAKER_02]: basement and I do again I my interview or
part is taking over I'm just curious then
[SPEAKER_02]: how could they allow a civilian to go in
attorney legal background or not without
[SPEAKER_02]: the proper clearance to just open up and
see a picture of what you said was an
[SPEAKER_02]: alien spacecraft from the classified files
of blue book like how I don't know I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know I don't know whether they temporarily
declassified the files or what they did
[SPEAKER_00]: all I know is they brought them there and
there were there must have been 20 20 25
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes of these these these light green
shoebox sized things with these
[SPEAKER_00]: microfusion them and they were all in this
room on these folding tables in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: downstairs in the Madison building and it
was like must have been I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: February March or it was I don't believe
there was even snow I think it must have
[SPEAKER_00]: been after March or so of 1977 when they
did it and that's where I saw the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: all right Gary then we'll go to Andy sorry
I know you gotta go sorry sorry Andy so I
[SPEAKER_01]: just got just two real quick questions all
right so since you actually physically saw
[SPEAKER_01]: the symbols have you tried to replicate
them and then without reading the
[SPEAKER_01]: documents included with the pictures how
can you be sure of the context of the
[SPEAKER_01]: photos you know even a TS project could
make soldiers say what the f so I just was
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering those two things okay yeah no
that the the that the I was always very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful because the the I copied them
traced them literally in the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence that those symbols were were
there at the base of the at the base of
[SPEAKER_00]: the dome but I'll show you I don't know if
you can see this you see here where am I
[SPEAKER_00]: here yeah I just put a pop prop it up
there you go yeah see I'll show you I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show you exactly what they look like but I
don't know what the sequence is I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the exact sequence they were in
but they were they were like this I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to see how close my guess was because I
drew some stuff what did you draw it okay
[SPEAKER_03]: what does that mean Andy now I
[SPEAKER_03]: see this yeah a little you know what let's
let's let's hold on a second there let's
[SPEAKER_00]: blow you up real quick Danny okay that's
that's that's what they they were a series
[SPEAKER_00]: of straight lines like that pointing
either from the lower left to the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: right or from the upper left to the lower
right and they had these these a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: series of dots in in little little
u-shaped things like this right right here
[SPEAKER_00]: in dots like this different sequences of
dots and they were all around the the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the dome of the of the of the
craft like this they were they were along
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of the dome of the craft all
right I lied I got one more question all
[SPEAKER_01]: right so that's very that's very similar
to cuneiform have you have you tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: match it based off of different dialects
of cuneiform yes I have is not cuneiform
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not cuneiform it was not it was it
was these things here and that that all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of physical structures have some
similarities to other physical structures
[SPEAKER_00]: but these were these were unique they were
they did not match when I was at the
[SPEAKER_00]: headquarters we checked it up they did not
match any other kind of communication hmm
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy that did that answer your question
