[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_05]: counterculture that is Canna.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_05]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be joined by members of the Canna
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_06]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_06]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_05]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the underground.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your support.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Matt, here with Breeders Syndicate,
and today we have Chuck E.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pollins with us, co-hosting, and we get to
have back the, what would you say,
[SPEAKER_06]: the legendary, I think he hits that
status, Mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's here.
In my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wizard.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a wizard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark wizard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we're going to talk today about
Mad Jag's journey with something we like
[SPEAKER_06]: to call Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: What he's done with it since, what tests
have been done on it, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we're all pretty stoked about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's great to have you back,
Mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell us about this MEX 40.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did the journey start?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent most of my years in the Verdean
Valley of Arizona, which is about the
[SPEAKER_01]: center of Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the four towns there are Jerome,
Cottonwood, Camp Verde, and Sedona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lived in Cottonwood, but I got to
know a lot of people in Jerome because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the hippie capital of Arizona from 19,
late 60s to present, more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's gotten a lot more fancy
people there in the last 20 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back in about 1974, 73, I was in
Jerome and I went into this store and met
[SPEAKER_01]: this lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had her own store.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was an artist and she carried other
artists on consignment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduced myself, we got to know each
other a little bit, but many, many years
[SPEAKER_01]: went beyond that because shortly
thereafter I got married, had two kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: whole world changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she kept her store going for over 30
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she and I both have had serious tragic
events in our lives four years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly four and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going through all this stuff in
my shed and I found this huge drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about two and a half feet wide by
four feet tall, all pencil drawing of an
[SPEAKER_01]: early girlfriend I had in Jerome named
Linda Goy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'd be happy to be famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's her next one minute of fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a photo of her, a drawing of her
from the side nursing her daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd been carrying it around for years
and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it from another friend who had died
and I inherited it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, I'm going to take this back to
this lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called her up on the phone and said,
hey, you know, is it right if I stop by?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stopped by, gave it to her and she
was so happy because she didn't have,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was from 1973, 72 when she drew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had no artwork of that magnitude from
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a, she was very happy to get it
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked for three hours,
hadn't seen her in roughly 35 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we exchanged histories and talked about
all the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been in Jerome since 1973.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's never lived anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is the, she knows every human's
history there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the people that I knew and some of
them that aren't around anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: One famous guy who was a grower in one of
the canyons, not far from Madjag Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was walking home from the spirit room
or Paul and Jerry's the two bars and he
[SPEAKER_01]: had a six pack and he tripped and fell on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it pierced his, his liver and he died
on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she filled me in on all these details
and I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I said, well, do you smoke still?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, well, I didn't for many
years, but I started a couple of years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was growing on a rooftop in,
in some containers, but she was still
[SPEAKER_01]: paranoid, even though it was legal in
Arizona now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she, so she, she says it's an old
habit cause she got busted in college and
[SPEAKER_01]: swore that she would never ever get busted
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't have to worry anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she told me that when she closed her
store about three years ago, she moved her
[SPEAKER_01]: giant safe to her home and she was going
through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she found this baggie, the old style
baggie that you had to lick to roll it and
[SPEAKER_01]: close way before ziplocks or press locks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And said there was a bunch of seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she, she remembered her friend who
this lady friend of hers, who was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a low level dealer, you know, when some
good herb would come into Jerome,
[SPEAKER_01]: she would get, you know, like five ounces
or something like that for her friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was 1984, roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when Sinsemea, everything
suddenly became Sinsemea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no more seeded weed coming from
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they suddenly realized where the
money was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 10, 20 times more expensive than
brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, and she believes,
she remembers that they would take,
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever there was some Sinse that came
through, there'd always be a few seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that someone would find and they'd keep
them, treasure them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And judging by the look of the seeds,
when I looked at them, I would say there
[SPEAKER_01]: was three varieties here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably three different loads that hit
town and then found five seeds in this
[SPEAKER_01]: load and 15 on that load and not in loads,
but like in what they got, maybe just
[SPEAKER_01]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kept them and they went into this
baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the seeds were, you know,
typical, like we see today marbled with
[SPEAKER_01]: nice shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was these really tiny seeds that
were the size of sesame seeds and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were perfectly dark black, round,
roundish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, wow, I haven't seen any
seeds like that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was some immature seeds,
kind of tan or couple that were white too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they knew better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she found this baggie and she went,
wow, I wonder if any of these would grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she took five of the marbled seeds,
planted them and to her surprise,
[SPEAKER_01]: they came up and they grew up on her
rooftop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when she went up to check and she
knew about how to, you know, sex males and
[SPEAKER_01]: females, she saw one was a male and she
pulled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had met her at this point because it was
2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I met her, it was late 2022 and
we got together and she pulled out this
[SPEAKER_01]: herb for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have two ounces of it in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a little too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: She took it too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still had nice, you know, crystals and,
and, but it wasn't, I said, what were the
[SPEAKER_01]: percent of the, you know, pistols were
that turned red or brownish?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said about 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She took it real early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, that's how that started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, um, are you a grower still?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh yeah, but it's been in my
backyard mostly in recent times or in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico at this other place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, oh, well, I have some seeds
and she pulled them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at them and she said,
you can have the rest of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got about 30 seeds from her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as you know, five, I sent 10,
I sent to you five for you and five for
[SPEAKER_01]: your friend who is the germ cell germ
specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't plant that year, but last
year I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided since the wet paper towel
method didn't work and whatever the German
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist was doing didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I had nothing to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't keep track carefully of the
ratio of which were the little tiny black
[SPEAKER_01]: ones and which were the marbled ones,
but I planted them both and six seeds came
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first seed, it took nine days in March
in Arizona when it was in the eighties in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine days just to poke up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other five, it took two or three
more days up to 11 days, which I had given
[SPEAKER_01]: up basically at about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went, you know, I don't know,
but I, I kept waiting, watered them and I
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up with six.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two females or males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that came up first must've been
one of those separate loads because it has
[SPEAKER_01]: super it was really strong and grew nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned out to be a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's, let's segue here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this company in Washington,
DC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent one of a little clipping off a leaf
today and I bought 10 tests for this
[SPEAKER_01]: season and they sent back that I had two
females and four males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one with the most vigor and it was
growing the fastest and came up first was
[SPEAKER_01]: a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had them in one gallon root maker
pots, hard plastic, and eventually they
[SPEAKER_01]: were put into five gallon root makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't put them into the big a hundred
gallon sock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two hundred gallons and two 30
gallons two years ago in New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I sat them on top of the old soil in
all these pots, let them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it looked like a bad storm or
something was weird going on, I just carry
[SPEAKER_01]: them into the green room inside,
set them in the window and they'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that all the way till I moved back
to Arizona in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I brought all six of them home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during the summer, when I had my
annual party on Labor Day weekend,
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend from Germany came over for a
month and another friend dread 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came over for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives in Monaco of all places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we met in person at Spandex in 2019 in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met 10 people in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, in fact, is Dredd.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just goes by Dredd and he's an
American.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's lived in Spain for like over 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked with Charlie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Erlen Grower, who went by Mustafunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met all these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came for a month and I had never
cloned anything before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never grown indoors either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had him show me how we bought one of
those little boxes that would hold I think
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 slots for clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cloned a bunch of cuttings off the
female that was so vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I ultimately seeded with
the last flowering of the four males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I seeded it just in time to get seven
weeks for the seeds to mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost all the seeds matured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are just a little lighter color,
which I separated from the perfectly
[SPEAKER_01]: mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure the lighter ones,
none of them were white or tan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I took four clones that are
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I had three other males,
I took their pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They each kind of pollinated about a week
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I separated their pollen, took one of
the clones, pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these clones were basically one bud
this long, one colon out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even have time to get
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were females from the mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, you know, here's three
different pollens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not pollinate one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one of those yielded about 40
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only this long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the big female, which grew to
about two feet tall, two feet wide,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it had, I haven't counted them,
but 200 seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about some of the taxonomy of
these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were there some that were more broad than
the others that finished way earlier that
[SPEAKER_06]: you could tell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the clones were all clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking about the two females,
they were entirely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one smaller female that was half
the size of the large one that I used,
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave to my friend Satva in Boulder area.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been growing for, I don't know,
four decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows more about Mexican strains and
Colombian strains than anyone I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen on any forum.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves Punta Roja.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's his favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he won't smoke anything that has
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's purely sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything he does is sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, my favorite fudge that I indulged
in now is he made with Cambodian cross
[SPEAKER_01]: with Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls it Campbellumbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so wonderful, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure sativa, two old strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did he have to say about his
experience with this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one he took, he said, this one is
talking to me, which is good because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to keep the larger one for seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was starting to get purple stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only 10 inches tall, maybe 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, this one's talking to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, then you should take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crossed it with Cambodian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the results right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to Argentina for three weeks with
his wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: He travels someplace new every year in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year younger than I am, so he's been
around a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his wife, she's a widower,
a widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like a stepfather now,
but he's such a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And stoner, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant he took was very similar
looking to the one I kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no broader leaves on the two
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, now that I've taken the pollen
from the last pollinating male of the
[SPEAKER_01]: three and pollinated the female,
I have a seed growing right now that's
[SPEAKER_01]: five weeks old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has broader leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've asked a couple people,
have you had the experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using T5 LEDs, not fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought one of those fixtures that holds
three and three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six, and it's four feet wide,
two feet by four feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have the four mothers under it right
now and the one plant growing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's broader leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked friends on forums,
is it your experience that under close
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs like this, it's 6,500 K.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the vegging light span.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the flowering light span.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, oh yeah, they're always
wider at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going, oh, so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're not indica looking,
but they're that in between kind of South
[SPEAKER_01]: American, Central American, a little bit
broader leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did any of the males have broad leaves at
all?
[SPEAKER_06]: You saw?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or were they all pretty narrow,
too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look at a photo.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you said you had four and then you had
three clones of a female, or you had a
[SPEAKER_07]: mother and then three clones of her,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That you hit individually with each male?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had more than three clones, but I gave
them to Sapa and a few others just because
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But initially I had two females and four
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with one big pot, which I didn't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I had a male right in with both
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the parties, people said,
no, you should probably take that male out
[SPEAKER_01]: and get rid of this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I wish I hadn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had three males after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one flowered like a week to 10
days later than the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last flowering one is the one I
used on the mother herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: The earlier two I used on two clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of those clones were like stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find them right here for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you got a chance to smoke any of this
stuff or sample any of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I especially the ones that my lady friend
grew, which there's a person involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: Ivy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just call it Ivy's mother.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a question from high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's one of the main dudes from our
discord.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you know anything about
him, but he was just asking and kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: curious, you know, how does that how does
I guess Ivy or how does how does the
[SPEAKER_07]: Mexicans that the Mexican stuff that
you're working with now compared to the
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff you were growing back in the canyon?
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for the very first year of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have anything identified as
Mexican, per se.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Oaxacan, which was sold to us.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK, let's step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: The earliest Hawaiian was Oaxacan brought
to Hawaii that most people believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: cross with Thai that was brought to
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friends in Hawaii sent me the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indirectly, I think was Oaxacan,
at least half Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of our plants were we planted a
shitload of Colombian because my best
[SPEAKER_01]: friend back then was Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had no idea that it wasn't going to
be ready till like Christmas.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was snowing on the rim above us
on Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these they weren't ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs were the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of my little fingertip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the huge plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they it wasn't very good smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we we sold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was sad because it needed to go to
least a Christmas at more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was true equatorial, you know,
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oaxacan mix, the Hawaiian,
they called it grew to 12 to 14 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we were also speculating
possibly Thai.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Thai grows so tall for the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just a very that's the second
year I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the very first year in Magic
Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that, we had some seeds left
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's about the time I met Robert
Clark and bought a bunch of skunk number
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nineteen seventy nine for the 1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 1980 is when we had two gardens
going and it was virtually all skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good thing I bought a lot
because I wish it saved a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I bought a lot because it was we
had foot tall plants and we came back in a
[SPEAKER_01]: week the first week of June and they're
all gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a plague of grasshoppers that
year and they ate hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants down to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the roots were still there and we kept
watering and most of them came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we replanted also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oddly enough, by by flowering time,
the ones we replanted the first week of
[SPEAKER_01]: June caught up with the ones the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lucky deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had bought three thousand seeds and
we started a little seedery seed area like
[SPEAKER_01]: four feet by five and just fill it with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had mesh over it like screen so
that no bugs could get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they started growing up,
we'd just stick our hands in the mud and
[SPEAKER_01]: pull one out, stick it over here in the
mud, walk across the garden, stick in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and they all survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's such a hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they truly are.
[SPEAKER_01]: People we said they truly are weed because
it's hard to get rid of weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, but they they had they were
leaning more towards sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the skunk number one,
the width of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had none that were like maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Tom Hill's maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that looks big and fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them were like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did get a few seeds of Afghan number
one, Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were fat as heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they just gave me a gift of 50 of
them, I think, because we bought so many
[SPEAKER_01]: of the skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have been interested in those just
to see how they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember actually even planting
those 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up with 275 females across two
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every week we went in for three days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even imagine how much work that
would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 28.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my partner was 29.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were like so fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drank tequila by the fire at night and
go get up and hike to the next garden a
[SPEAKER_01]: mile away and then walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would only water after the sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never watered when sun was in the
canyon because we did all kinds of tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was go up to the rim while the
other person started watering before the
[SPEAKER_01]: sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like mirrors where the water was
flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next thing, because we had
open little plots, we did a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like it was shining in the
morning, you know, the mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of us went up to the top,
sat up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looked down and it was like mud
mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started piling up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge piles of oak leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we watered before the sun
came up, we spread the oak leaves over the
[SPEAKER_01]: mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't see a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they grew up into big plants,
they were touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, you couldn't see any
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually pulled off one or two
waterings at the end of the year,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just like the hour before the
sun went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started getting help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little chilly.
[SPEAKER_01]: October.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back then, I mean, growing up,
you know, doing stuff in the black market
[SPEAKER_07]: myself, there was always like an edge of,
you know, nervousness or a little bit,
[SPEAKER_07]: always a healthy little bit whenever I was
up to something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I couldn't imagine back, you know,
in the 70s or the 80s doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, did you, did you ever get
comfortable with that kind of,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, doing what you were doing in
that lifestyle or whatever?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or did you, did you, was it every day you
were just like, this could be the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of it, my, I had two,
I had a partner who would smoke when in
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had, we had a third partner who just
helped us here and there, like prepping at
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was from Switzerland and he lived in
the Verde Valley for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the year, he,
he lived in the garden for three weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: straight and he'd get high all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never got high.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all, ever until harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would have one puff by the
fireside and just to see what it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what skunk like, you know, but I always
wanted to be straight enough so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could hear and not be too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would let them, it would,
it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one time we were asleep in our tent
and I heard a voice and I was up in growth
[SPEAKER_01]: in less than 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I didn't have my boots on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went up the tent and it was coming
from up on the rim above us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hunters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, and then we heard a rifle shot
and they were after a deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the closest and the scariest
call of all, that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys didn't carry weapons,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I carried a big throwing knife.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never knowing you need a throwing knife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say, I don't deal in
black market shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I live in Michigan now, so it's legal,
but do you ever miss that kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of, I don't know any kind of
excitement from that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: back then, do you ever miss that kind of
excitement?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that it's legal, there's a bit of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of not as cool or fun to you
or to me, at least there was something fun
[SPEAKER_07]: about just doing something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you shouldn't be doing and getting
away with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of miss that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had enough of it, so I really don't miss
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just so happy that we can be open here
in the Southwest, except for Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada is legal now, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utah is not because the Mormon aspect,
but all these others, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona,
California, Washington, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan, Illinois, New York,
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: My sister lives in Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: My rasta friend, Ricky, lives in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the black market is still big there
because at 300 to 350 an ounce in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries for New York, people go,
that's ridiculous, you know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what chemicals are being
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone still has their old friend
that's the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you visited any of the rec stores,
like the recreational weed stores?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've visited five in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one was a co-op before it was even
legal medically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys were like, wow,
running on a shoestring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I parked like 500 yards away in a shopping
mall and walked to their store because I
[SPEAKER_01]: knew it was being watched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was like 2010 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was I went in and they had a giant
safe inside that they kept everything in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought some what's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from Ace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Malawi Tiger?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not Malawi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something Tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was they classified as super
sociable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was laughing gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he just laughed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool that they had that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of like I've never seen that
in a rec store ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two grams from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And walked around the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in case I was followed, they
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what ever happened to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been to about five regular
recreation stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my medical license in 2012,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could go to the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I went to a couple of dispensaries
and one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually gave the guy some weed and we
were going to work something out where he
[SPEAKER_01]: would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was presently at that time getting
all his food from California and not
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd drive over in his pickup truck and
get a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he'd get a better deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he'd buy 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in Globe, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was going through the Arizona,
California checkpoint like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, some Halsey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Savage.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are mean there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you want me to grab it?
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being this is the stuff that she took too
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see the shriveled leaves are
really small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could definitely tell it was a bit
early, but, yeah, I know it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: developed and a little little color on the
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not purple purple, but it's not green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see there's plenty of resin on
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took I did a one toe test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I did a three toe test, which is how
I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one took I didn't feel much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went, huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I didn't calculate in my mind that,
hey, THC was five to seven percent back
[SPEAKER_01]: then on good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took two more puffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 15 minutes later, when I was
going, gosh, I guess it's not even that
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's we used to call it creeper weed
where you take a bunch of hits and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you go, huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it just creeps up
on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a nice little buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really reminded me of Mexican from
the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first year I grew in 1976 was
with seeds and my friend who was a dealer
[SPEAKER_01]: in Tempe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for two years, he took the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kept seeds from the best loads that he
sent through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sold a lot of weed to the campus
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Tempe and.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your pictures?
[SPEAKER_01]: You found them.
[SPEAKER_07]: What flavors did you get on that or
profiles as far as the smoke?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you said it's a little early,
probably wasn't super developed,
[SPEAKER_07]: but is there anything you can describe
about the way it tasted?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been that good with aromas on
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't make me cough or gag or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever she did, the way she she said,
she put it in paper bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was fairly slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just sitting out in the sun like
some people.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are these are my photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are comparison photos of plants that
were posted on ICMAG, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you how do you think it fared in
comparison to the Zacatecas?
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks a lot more narrow leaf and.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks a lot more narrow leaf than the
Zacatecas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it reminds me, yeah, just even
growing some H&L's mango, like the outdoor
[SPEAKER_07]: shit I grew.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks a lot some not, you know,
obviously the same or anything,
[SPEAKER_07]: but that kind of narrow leaf look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also an email that came with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That talked about.
[SPEAKER_06]: The primary aromas, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is it is cinnamon,
pine, hops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, from the term.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So beta carofaline, alpha pining,
alpha humuline, beta pining, carofaline
[SPEAKER_06]: oxide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beta transosamine, terpenaline and beta
mercy.
[SPEAKER_06]: What if that would end up smell like like
a slightly different super silver haze?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a how many weeks are you looking
at when you're talking about flower in
[SPEAKER_07]: these?
[SPEAKER_01]: See this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see the one that just posted
shared screen?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is I can't see it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother plant that was much vigorous
than the others, and that's that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: width of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: These leaves are wider than my lady
friends that shriveled up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are what I would call in between.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was typical Mexican looking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the background are coneflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Echinacea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Echinacea in medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's great medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can page through these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing aerial photo down on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up close.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's cool to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see if they meet up or don't meet
up the Echinacea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The serrations at blueberries back there
to your blackberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now I see how this is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'm going to open another file and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first week in November when I
brought them back before female clones
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm I was grooming to be mothers and
there'll be plenty of clones able to come
[SPEAKER_01]: off these.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the beginning of November.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to show you a photo photo
from two days ago and.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took two of the bulbs out, so there's
only four bulbs because they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: growing too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one gallon pots, I took them out of
the pots three weeks ago and trimmed one
[SPEAKER_01]: inch off the root ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them back in with build a soil 3.0
fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they love that, but it's just making
them grow faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't need them bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need them in your hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, keep the lights right touching them.
[SPEAKER_06]: About the best you can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep cutting off the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's high above them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let him get all root bound.
[SPEAKER_06]: All kinds of things you can do alright.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever got tile magic, you gotta come
to one of the events that Matt and the
[SPEAKER_07]: guys put on dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get him there one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so.
There's.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they look like now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little guy in the little girl in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how broad them is are so
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the mothers two of them are very
kind of yellowish green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only exact same soil and these two
are deep green and huge and because I I
[SPEAKER_01]: prune them all back when I did the root
burning too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just have tons of little fresh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant right here could probably
create 40 clones right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, without even it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I'm terrified of root pruning.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing I like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've tried it a few times and really,
really like shoot up the main tap root.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: After that I was like, I'm not cutting
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how the leaves the actual width of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the size of my index finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's only since September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all clones of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all clones off that mother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, and that one's just not liking the
soil for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or the light or something something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know the light identical
soil building soil 3.0 is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the mom directly in the center or more
in the center than the other ones?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you know with H&L some of his
hazes, I think the AM it doesn't like that
[SPEAKER_07]: direct light.
[SPEAKER_07]: It likes to be on like the outskirts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother's long gone from the six
original plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seeded her with the last male and but I
took clones off her before I seeded her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are her clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are her babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are identical plants to the
mother genetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, typically the way they're
growing, they look slightly different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why cannabis is a motherfucker
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's the more the more you grow
clones of each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: The more you grow clones in volume,
you'll see that happen all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's what we run into when making
feminizes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, 20 clones of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spray all of them to reverse the same
exact way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And eight of them will reverse and 12 of
them won't.
[SPEAKER_06]: That happens very, very commonly.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, here's.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the little clone box.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is from September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they all look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four, five, like six
clones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave to Satva and others, and I kept the
four of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these these are the big plants we just
looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each of them is a potential mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, easy for cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice little clone dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't fill it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a nice one, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never even seen one look like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had like nine branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take away too much from her because I was
planning on seeding her within the next
[SPEAKER_01]: week or two after that, so I could get at
least six to eight weeks of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't want to do all this work
and end up with a bunch of unmature
[SPEAKER_01]: immature seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've been talking about releasing
some of these seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: On the site or through the discord somehow
making them available to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it I think there'll be big
interest in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hope credit card processing goes
back up soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Credit card processing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it just went down this last week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's the same one most seed people
use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, they went out for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here I'm going to show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can always edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of editing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, leave that one in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave the edit part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, do you think you think Rob Clark's a
more heavier partier than you,
[SPEAKER_07]: Mad Jack?
[SPEAKER_07]: You think he parties harder than you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to open those first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you link to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just want to just open.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see the one I just opened?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to reshare the file.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fairness, I did just drop this on the
last second as far as like him sharing the
[SPEAKER_06]: file.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we used it a year and a half ago,
but I don't remember it from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: So good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the female that yielded the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what she looked up close.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was just starting the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are two males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the other female that Sapa
ended getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're sitting on top of a hundred
gallon tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it held 12, one gallon, one cubic
foot bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of expensive, but I had to.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that's that's been for seed
making.
[SPEAKER_01]: It created these monsters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I I set these out every day in the sun
and and until it got to the point where we
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to get some cold rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's late September in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I just brought them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're near enough leaves,
definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's interesting is there's a
lot of similar looks to with that in
[SPEAKER_06]: blueberry, like you just blueberry,
which also has the Mexican in it,
[SPEAKER_06]: supposedly as best I knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, DJ Short was using Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I won't tell the whole story,
but I introduced Rob Clark to a friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine that owned land in the Ozarks about
1978 and 79.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were going to do something there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't comment on comments on it
because I don't really know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he they sent me a photo or two of the
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like, man, swamp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet the Ozarks.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What in the hell would you even do in the
Ozarks?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from Chicago and he bought from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave an ounce of magic to Mick Jagger
at a party in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fame never heard about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, he had our sticker on the
side of it and everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyway, you've seen a little bit of
you can't use these photos anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, they're going to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the test results from December
4th.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Chuck, where do you go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's Internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always on a phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of my sample, I put in from from that
female, that two foot female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not my girlfriends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will share the screen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ivy number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was six point seven percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and also the terpene profile compared
to the other one is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how that corroborated that
there's more than one load from Jerome
[SPEAKER_01]: from 64, 65 involved in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: She stopped smoking in 1985.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stopped smoking in 85 because she was
pregnant with her daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when she put the seeds in the
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they came from 84, 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now when I got this test done,
it showed that, yeah, there's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: two strains or varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least if not three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested to see now that I'm growing
one of the seeds to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to get it to flowering and I don't
know how to do that actually under the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless I get the mothers to you and then I
can just use the lights, I can turn it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so I can get a couple of flowers
and then I can have them tested and see
[SPEAKER_01]: how they compare to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder I wonder if the THC remains the
same.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people that that are newer to
cannabis think that THC is and I'll be all
[SPEAKER_06]: like that go shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, number one was something like 12
percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or 14 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a woman walk out of the bathroom
after two tokes into a table, do a front
[SPEAKER_01]: flip, knock all the drinks over the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: My best friend and I and two ladies and we
got caught by the head dancer and we had
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they finished the maybe they had three
tokes, but she she couldn't even walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would suck trying to dance after
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were sitting there and they went right
past us and into the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just mainly wanted to point out
that low THC isn't the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is more of a breeding tool,
something something to have the building
[SPEAKER_06]: block.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the it's the beautiful terpenes that
that's what I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aroma of these plants now is right
back to the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like someone just took me to
an early garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just beautiful aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to compare it to,
but it's definitely high in the lemon,
[SPEAKER_01]: limey, terpenaline side.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I need to ask Satva because he loved
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his favorite that those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenial, pineal and limonene and lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks for those because they were all
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their effects are up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He only wants up weed, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his Campbell Lumbo is definitely up
for a man after about an hour after I've
[SPEAKER_01]: taken it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dance, fix energetic weed, my car,
whatever, you know, clean the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of reminds me of the Coke days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was like, I know what else does
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: What else does that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Brings it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except it's it's a more of a dreamy edge
than, you know, now when I'm cleaning the
[SPEAKER_01]: house, it's more like nice.
Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to try to make these
available ASAP for everyone and see how it
[SPEAKER_06]: goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked to see people's results with
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything else you wanted to
cover?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just I wanted to ask you this because I
probably never get another chance.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if you'll even be able to
fucking see these, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the beaver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beaver Britt, you know, Rob Clark gave a
bunch of these out to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you knew anything about
these.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're basically the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a brief period.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was after I grew, you know,
Sam Scunkman, Dave Watson, he collects
[SPEAKER_01]: labels, he collected and I sent him Madjag
labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we got five loads of 500 kilos,
a thousand pounds, we got five thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: pound loads from Mexico in 1984,
roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one we got had labels on
every 25 pound cellophane wrapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that the guys it was
meant for were in California, but they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the last load.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they gave that load to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was loose labels, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sent some of those to Amsterdam to
Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was very happy to get him there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on ICMAG in his media collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you can see his label collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a hundred different labels,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that he just passed away last
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one was they weren't beavers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were they were they weren't skunks
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: The raccoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were raccoons in a wagon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember seeing those on the ICMAG page.
[SPEAKER_01]: A load of weed in the back of the wagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is another label, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew he loved them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sent them to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob Clark invited me every year because he
was we go to Amsterdam for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just last time I was there was 1969.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first place at Club
Paradiso in ADAM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't smoke cigarettes, so I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a hit and coughed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some guy came up and he had a shoe box
full of Turkish weed for fifteen dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at it and I just went,
no, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a sugar cube size chunk of hash and
I brought it back to the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't smoke it till a few months later.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first two joints I bought in 1966 from
the only hippie in our Chicago suburban
[SPEAKER_01]: high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he I stashed them for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still not quite sure if I wanted to
smoke them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really didn't get high till 1969.
[SPEAKER_06]: That probably would have been Colombian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, something Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Chicagoland.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my my grandfather was getting weed
from Mexican Mexican brickweed from down
[SPEAKER_07]: there, I guess, around that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's in up northern Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could be possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not too far from Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it's more likely Mexican than it
is Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because the Colombo connection,
I think, came after Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico was sending weed in the 40s to the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were sneaking it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when that whole deal of the
freaky movies about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll make women get raped and just silly
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the name of that famous movie?
[SPEAKER_07]: Reefer Madness?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Reefer Madness, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the 30s, 40s, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Reefer was in inner cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely probably out west in the hills,
too, because you could just hop on a horse
[SPEAKER_01]: and ride across the border back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no walls or fences even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they if you had to prove you're an
American, they just ask you and if you
[SPEAKER_01]: could speak English.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'm from Tucson.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd say, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started going to Jamaica,
all I had to have is a birth certificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had my original birth certificate,
but it was almost tattered from folding so
[SPEAKER_01]: many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would accept that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rob Clark met me in the grill for two
or three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to go on a seed hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't really ever happen because other
things were extenuating in certain senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a good time together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he was married then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met his wife was just this really
cool hippie lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember her name.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just got remarried again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think last time we talked to him,
he said he was getting married or
[SPEAKER_07]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: He got remarried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see like a hash church, I think,
or some different interviews on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've caught him over the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a couple different people interviewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was like an hour long.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to party for like two or three days
and fish and a bunch of the guys,
[SPEAKER_07]: H&L especially, and a couple other guys
brought a bunch of good weed and just had
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I could not keep up with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time he came to see skunk number
one in our garden, we hiked him in and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, you're growing it out of dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, what do you mean dirt?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, where we grow this in
Northern California, it's fluffy black
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ours was hard packed brown dirt that
we had turned and then planted and then
[SPEAKER_01]: watered and it compressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had this little zip case when we
were in Cottonwood and he zipped it open
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had Thai, he had Colombian,
he had Mexican, he had all these separate
[SPEAKER_01]: little vials with pre-made joints in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd pull one out, split it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took one hit off and I was laying on the
floor in the room and he could smoke the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole rest of the joint by himself.
I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was never on that league.
[SPEAKER_07]: He partied.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one night, I think all of us
maybe slept a total of like two hours and
[SPEAKER_07]: then we got on a boat at like 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: and fished for eight hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then did it again the same night.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like the energizer bunny,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend from Columbia, I saw him smoke
an ounce in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen except for Rastafarian or
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just basically chain smoke all day,
joint after joint after joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chucky style.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, I'm excited to see people
plant this and cross it with various
[SPEAKER_01]: plants because these are going to be all
new hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a missing link for 40 years
that has a chance now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't mention this, but I'm pretty
sure the reason why my lady friend
[SPEAKER_01]: succeeded and I did in germinating these
was mycorrhizae because we both use really
[SPEAKER_01]: good quality soil that has some
mycorrhizae in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do the wet paper towel method
or the germ method, there's no mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took nine days for that one to
first come up because older seed coats are
[SPEAKER_01]: thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was kind of in stasis over all
those 40 some years in the safe because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was never touched, never got any human
germs on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she pulled them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she put the baggie back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year, when I met her, she gave it to
me and I was like, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_01]: a baggie baggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the wild part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the missing link in germinating
old seeds is mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put it in real soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use building soil 3.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: She used something she bought on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said it had mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing that made it
unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cheap, but it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the name of it somewhere because
she kept the records.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really like the guys that build the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten to know them over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought 40 bags at $30 a bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said $3?
[SPEAKER_01]: $1300 each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was $1300 for 40 bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three and a half hour drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those 200 gallon ones took 12 each,
12 bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 took three and a half each.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had like four left over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's an expensive seed making
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one plant was close to 12 feet
tall and the other one was it was my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend from California, from Davis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was his old seeds from old collectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Acapulco gold crossed with
Santa Marta gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was Pyrrativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number of people smoked it and said
it's one of their favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one was from ET.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it ET spells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a special.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got the four different varieties in it
from he grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a hippie child.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew up in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: His parents had a poster shop during the
Ashbury days.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew up knowing all these people,
all the people that were the early.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew people in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brotherhood of eternal love.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me some of these seeds that were
really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plant was like eight feet tall
and eight feet wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Centimia, but I found three
seeds on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manicuring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're in the collection here,
ready to go this year.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk about how to get that from A
to B, because I'd love to bring you the
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you had to get a bathtub
installed first.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bathtub's right where everything else
needs to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could it be moved?
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs to be installed, is what it needs
to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take three, three-ish weeks
to get it done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, get it done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: And tiled.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not just the bathtub though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all got to be re-tiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to trim these four
mother plants then again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take another two inches off them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll sprout back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got one of those cabinets with me
that's unassembled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be glad to give you if you want for a
cloning cabinet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has 20 slots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only used six or so that time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That little cloning thing, I'm used to
just regular domes, throw pearlite in
[SPEAKER_06]: them, 10-inch by 20-inch tray,
and a seven-inch, six-inch dome.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that looked like it was all profesh,
a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a strip of Samsung LEDs across the
top, two strips.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that AC Infinity's product or is that a
different brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: AC Infinity.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bigger one, this is their smallest
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make one little hole, I think 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that looks nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only like $50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought two, and one's in the Mexico and
one's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you the one that's here
because it's not assembled yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a timer on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can set the time for how much light
you want on the cloning box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what my friend chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 hours?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound right or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it worked very nice in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had them out of there and into the
one-gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks like it has a temperature
sensor control in there or environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a separate little one I bought
and just put in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, those are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can hurry along here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I shall do my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people would like to get these for
this growing season coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in your state, I'd say probably March
is when things are happening, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: April at the very latest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll work out how to get this done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to just drive over with the
seeds one day and meet you and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't trust the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mail can be smirly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're too valuable to take that chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't any more of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did keep five of the original seeds from
my lady friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the marbled ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in the refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually start from scratch if
we wanted to at some point.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I shall get to editing and have this
up for Friday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: What time do you usually air on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_01]: 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that'd be 7 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have this reggae collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this company called Reggae
Collector in Japan that advertises on
[SPEAKER_01]: Discogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sent them this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took two days to write down the name of
every album I have in 12 inch,
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sent them an entire list and I
haven't heard back from them in a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I realized I need to call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're open from seven o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: My time is when they've been open for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I accidentally called them about right at
the dot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy who answered spoke only
Japanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I send them a link from like a Dropbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use mega.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had it all on there so they could
just click on it and read it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 45 I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real 45 is a small one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The store I bought them from stamped.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's eight stores in Kingston and
McGill, Savalamar, Mow Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought them all in like 1978 and 79.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're pretty collectible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they used to hand stamp them and like
try to sometimes they'd write on the top
[SPEAKER_06]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some of them where they stamp the
actual record.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the inner with the giant circle right
next to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's funny is all those old
reggae 45s when I go through big huge
[SPEAKER_06]: stacks of them, most of the time they look
like someone used them as a frisbee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they are rough.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of mine have never been plain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 12 inch 45s I played them once
just to see if it's worth recording.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make it digital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're flawless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to sell this whole collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said if it's if you have over 100
records, they will come to wherever you
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, you know, if they read them,
then that's what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, hopefully they hit you back
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told them I can go as far as Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phoenix or Tucson, I'd be glad to meet you
if you didn't want to come to my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'd be kind of fun to have them show
up at the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there are other people in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: that are on their team, you know,
because they have to be able to evaluate
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's there's a lot of reggae
collectors in England, too, that'll come
[SPEAKER_06]: out and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any other sources of
information, please send me a link to my
[SPEAKER_01]: not my phone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: Emails are the way of old people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, texting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything goes back in circles,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't be surprised if we were back
emailing here soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can be hitting each other on each other's
pagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, man, I have a flip phone,
so I don't have a smartphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a 4G.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made by Kyocera, but it's rubberized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's waterproof, not resistant,
waterproof feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can drop it in a creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly used by people in construction
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an orange button on the top side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a push to talk and it turns it into a
walkie talkie.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have someone else who has one and
you can just talk instantly, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a browser, but the browser is
this big, tiny little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried using it once for Google
Maps and it was worthless.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a QWERTY board.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to press three times to get a C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to just do a text, it's a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_07]: That T9 is what I think they call it or
something like that, whatever they call
[SPEAKER_07]: that back then.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how you had to press three things
or whatever to get the... Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although there's a couple that have four.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the very end, there's four choices.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you used to be really good at that
shit as a kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason I've kept to this,
I don't want to carry and be bothered by
[SPEAKER_01]: emails in the day when I'm... Emails are
for my laptop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a laptop that hooks up to Verizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm traveling, yeah, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my life, I like to sit down at my
laptop that's plugged into a 24 inch
[SPEAKER_01]: screen and do everything here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Text, I don't mind if someone sends me a
text and it's text, but if they send me a
[SPEAKER_01]: link, I have to hand copy the link onto my
computer here, like HTTPS slash app.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write it all down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you would send it to my email,
I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the regular guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any other punk stuff you're looking for
or old ones, I've got the first Black
[SPEAKER_01]: Sabbath album in its pristine condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was surprised to see the Cockney rejects
in there though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, that's real punk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never heard of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're punk punk.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're British from Cockney.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a lot of the early football
anthems, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something they played yesterday at the
Superbowl, something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe just a little more punk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just a tad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't watch the Superbowl either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't watch that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Olympics, seeing people trying
to break the record for pole vault or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a pole vault when I was in grade
school, seventh and eighth grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm too short.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need bamboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the rug store and get these blue
poles and we tape them on every joint and
[SPEAKER_01]: we could get those to bend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like the fiberglass poles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did it once.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chuckie told me he wasn't going to watch
the NFL yesterday because he doesn't like
[SPEAKER_06]: the clothes on the men.
[SPEAKER_06]: He likes them to be oiled up and pulled on
each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a jockstrap in wrestling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm still young.
[SPEAKER_07]: Buck.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was hoping for a nip slip or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: But from what I understand, it didn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was an exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was fucking with just re-up potting all
night or all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then today I was up potting until just
literally I hopped on here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm fucking worn out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go upstairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to carry all my soil up and
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a shit ton of stuff going on right
now, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my friend who helped us air drop our
hoses, two inch rubber hoses and 50
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon, 50 pound bags of blood meal and
bone meal into Mad Jack Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got together with him a few weeks ago
and two other people from that era up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Cottonwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all had breakfast together,
talked about stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't fly much anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's four years older than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: But boy, the stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kicking pipes out of a helicopter down a
canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took the airplane.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Cessna.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took the door off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the back seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took the front seat out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had these bags piled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wrapped rope around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mummified them because the first time
we dropped them, just with lots of tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bone meal exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the blood, the bone meal, when it
exploded, made a giant white circle about
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we got back to we raced out there and
went down in the canyon and spread dirt
[SPEAKER_01]: over it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we mummified them with cheap sisal
rope so that when they hit, the most they
[SPEAKER_01]: can do is break a hole maybe this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little would squirt out the side,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dropped probably 600 pounds between 300
of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took three flights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got good where I could hold the rope
and push it just at the last minute and
[SPEAKER_01]: hold it in the air, 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd say, now I just open my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we lost one 100-foot roll of two-inch
hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found it two years later in a juniper
tree on the ridge where it landed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we even hiked up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we never looked up in the trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started to be on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you doing this all in your robe up in
the plane?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have your robe on while you're
dropping them out the back?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was our future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought that we would do a movie or a
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first wife made all those costumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She used to make costumes for bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she made those long robes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we became the wizards of the rim.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are what attracted me to the story
was seeing these pictures of these guys in
[SPEAKER_06]: wizard robes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also hired a guy from a local photo
shop and camera shop in Phoenix that we
[SPEAKER_01]: got to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought him in for three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he shot 30 rolls of 35-millimeter
film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one who took a lot of those
photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took him up in the dark and drove
four miles out the four-wheel drive trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he didn't know exactly where we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't really necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were just being smart in case he
got busted or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to develop these photos at
the company he worked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Chuck, where do you live now in
Michigan?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm originally from Kentucky, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Kalamazoo College for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not too far from Kalamazoo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm up on the outskirts of Battle Creek in
the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's great, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I moved up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I moved here from an old lady to do some
school and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, I wanted to grow weed
legally.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in Kentucky still.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just went medical last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of great to be able to do
what.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, New Mexico went legal last April for
recreation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, you could probably speak
on this better than anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do my thing no matter what.
[SPEAKER_07]: But not having to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you mentioned your friend talking
about how she was on the roof,
[SPEAKER_07]: still kind of hiding out and still had a
shock from, you know, years before.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I moved up here, it would freak me
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just my plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a couple of plants outside or when I
was smoking, dude, it would freak me out a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit still for a good solid,
like six months every time a car.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tell her, get out, get out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've given away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like those giant plants from New
Mexico to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've slowly but surely given away all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did trade a little bit to a friend who's
a distiller and makes his own whiskey and
[SPEAKER_01]: wine and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but, yeah, it's it's just fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no one's after us or it's just I
love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think I'd see it in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, really, I mean, fucking long time it
took.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a common a common like easy access
to good genetics, like through the guys
[SPEAKER_07]: and the discord and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like even the equipment,
like like you were showing earlier,
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's like the best time to be a young
dude or anyone really in starting to grow
[SPEAKER_07]: and get into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's there's still good stuff
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up head grower on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you did you check that, Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's got a beautiful greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: His father-in-law goes by the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you, Larry, but you, Larry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know who that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming up with or they already
have come out with that as a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you, Larry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got labels made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his head grower, he was interviewed by
James Lowe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowe Lowe, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: James Lowe about something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: About five interviews ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he looks like he's straight from India.
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably has hair down to his knees and
he wraps it all around and it's all on
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sadhus wear their hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got a beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, he looks like he just came from
India.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it is budgler friends with CSI,
too?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you, Larry, is that someone different
than Budular?
[SPEAKER_01]: Budular is different than Budular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, for years with some on ICMAG
under a different name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't met them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my friend from Davis, he comes to the
party in New Mexico every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, Chuckie, if you want to
come to New Mexico for Labor Day weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, we had seven states represented
and Germany and Monaco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a total of 20 people from seven
different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all the youngest grower there
was 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: All been growing for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all if they could, they brought
some of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and when they leave, they leave it for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I in turn, then take it back to
Arizona and or in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give it all away.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the guys is from Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He and his wife drive all the way from
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've come every year for four years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bring the bomb and the bomb is active
from seven in the morning till midnight in
[SPEAKER_01]: the green room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's testing each other's and
oh, well, you should try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I take them on little four wheel drive
excursions in the area up to 12 miles from
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado border.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's several passes that go through
to Colorado into really remote areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go to Trinidad, which is the first
town in southern southeastern.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have 30 rec stores in a town of seven
thousand people because it's closest to
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but now that New Mexico is legal and
they're popping up like weekly they've
[SPEAKER_01]: lost I bet they've lost 10 of their stores
already in Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all you have to do is drive across
from from El Paso.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's 10 stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can buy two ounces a day in that's
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: The limit's one a day per store in New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy two ounces at once,
go out the door, come back in and 10
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes later, buy two more ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could literally buy two pounds
from one store by just going back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth in the day into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't keep they don't take a photo of
your license.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't keep records.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if you're a medical patient,
then you have a limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a record patient,
it's so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're sucking all the sales from
Colorado, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they just here they just literally
went from and when I moved up here,
[SPEAKER_07]: you could go in and buy two point five
ounces, walk out, come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now they got it to where you just they
have to it's a separate receipt or a
[SPEAKER_07]: different order.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you could stand there now,
though, and literally just get as much as
[SPEAKER_07]: you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there might be some kind of limit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, I've went in there and got
more than I needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been to Ann Arbor, but it's the
boulder or Berkeley of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been kind of the activist
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll bet some of the early weed that I
had when I was at Kalamazoo came from Ann
[SPEAKER_01]: Arbor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's where we had that little
party with.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't too far from there, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you know, St. The lake was St.
Clair, Lake St. Clair that we went to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or any particular fish?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's walleye.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a small, small mouth is why we
were there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, there's large mouth and
some other shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a yellow perch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Walleye pike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not real familiar with those
particular fish, but we were there for
[SPEAKER_07]: small mouth for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have enough to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk with you in the next few
days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And find out how to get the seed seed
within the next week, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk to you soon.
