[SPEAKER_01]: I like it, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the provenance dives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of which, Dragonfly is asking
about the HP 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that one again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the Hash Plant 13 that's
prominent on Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say any specific names,
but basically... He'd love to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about it, he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is... The cut is still held down
within Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get access to breed with it,
but Grayskull the Grower, a well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: person, he got stuck up on Maui because he
didn't follow the instructions on what
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted him to do with the HP 13 and
Skunk Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he had the Maui Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Skunk Dog is an actual mainland bag
seed variety found on Maui that people
[SPEAKER_00]: still grow and love, but the dog was
pre-that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from the 70s, 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically like a licorice gas
variety, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Grayskull the Grower had the dog,
Maui Dog, and HP 13, and I told him,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still friends to this day,
I told him, I'm like, dude, those are cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to fuck around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have those, and they catch you
breeding with those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pull up on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he got pulled up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people know that story,
but it's kind of a bad look, in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, for Hawaii with the weed game
doing that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have a lot of proud guys that it
is what it is, and it's like, I'll explain
[SPEAKER_00]: it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know guys on Big Island, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Knotsodog, I believe the guy's name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and him don't really like each other,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But him and CSI are friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me he bought hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of Purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Oracle work from Caleb's CSI, and he
couldn't ever find anything like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then me and him were talking,
right?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mad Farmer's gonna jump in,
he's gonna lose his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just listen, this is all truth right
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I happen to believe it or not,
small enough world, my best friend growing
[SPEAKER_00]: up's dad, his brother is the original farm
Purple Oracle's out of, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, if you look into it,
me and this guy, we're talking stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a couple of podcasts back in 2018
or 19 talking about Hawaii strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically was trying to set me up
because he wanted to get the cherry pie
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that I had that he knows Purple Oracle
dominant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he tried some of my flower on Big
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: He already knew what time it was,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right there, I tell him,
look, I don't want to trade for this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want HP 13 and I want the dog and I'm
gonna breed with it, but I need permission
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm considered a white boy,
Holly out here in Hawaii, but I'm born and
[SPEAKER_00]: raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like on my island, ain't nobody
can tell me shit because they know I
[SPEAKER_00]: earned, I paid the dues to be respected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically he didn't want to make that
agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't want to make that trade,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I called him on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you should breed with it then
and release that seeds to the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out I went and talked to the people
that are actually well connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even supposed to have those
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they can't really seeds of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're not going to get rolled up on
and have them taken from them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's why the seeds aren't out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's just people that don't
want it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know them, but like they don't want
me to do it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that's something that I do
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't comment on the, you know,
interbreeder stuff, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to Hawaii, there are a lot
of people who are proud of the cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: they have and they're not willing to let
them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I've definitely
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final point I want to make on
this is if you look into it, CSI is now
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to acquire a cut of cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: From dungeon bolts genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I know all of this is happening
this way because we're been dominating
[SPEAKER_00]: that purple cherry line for a long ass
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Matt farmer's killing it too,
but I'm saying some of these other guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these other guys that be saying
they got this and that it's all about the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf, um, serration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't have the double serration on
it and the right darkness to the color
[SPEAKER_00]: where the leaf's almost like a blue to it,
it's not the real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, listen, man, we, I'm a,
I'm a big fan of what you're putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely don't want to get in the
middle of, uh, you know, the, the breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: conflicts.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not bringing your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not bringing any drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I just stated right there is
actual true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not publicly aired because I get
deleted off of every platform that I'm on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people who speak the truth,
what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did notice that you'd lost your
Instagram again, but, um, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different person.
