[SPEAKER_09]: So we're pretty excited today.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we've been doing a lot of early
breeding talk, trying to source some of
[SPEAKER_09]: the history of how we got to where we are
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've talked about breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about a bunch of early eighties
and nineties seed banks.
[SPEAKER_09]: We focused on Neville quite a bit because
he was one of the largest seed banks in
[SPEAKER_09]: the eighties.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're pretty excited today because we
have the other largest seed bank of the
[SPEAKER_09]: eighties, the Super City of a Seed Club,
which was next to Neville, the biggest
[SPEAKER_09]: seed bank in Holland at the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And lots and lots of famous strains like
Williams Wonder and Beatrix Choice and
[SPEAKER_09]: things of that nature came out of their
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're lucky in that the founder is
still alive and well and was excited to
[SPEAKER_09]: talk to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to bring you a couple stage
interview with Correll, who is the owner
[SPEAKER_09]: and founder of the Super City of a Seed
Club.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to be asking him a lot of
questions about the eighties, the style of
[SPEAKER_09]: they were doing things, how he got certain
strains and really all the areas of
[SPEAKER_09]: interest we can think of.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is kind of like the second big
piece to eighties seed banks and modern
[SPEAKER_09]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prepare yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pronounced Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cattle, cattle, cattle, cattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're you're a legend in this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of us would love would love to
have this opportunity to speak with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it easy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a guy of flesh and blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's it's really cool to be able
to have this opportunity to ask you some
[SPEAKER_02]: some questions about the history of SSC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where would you like to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a long time ago already,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1985, we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were squatters and we were like
you are, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were activists and our idea was to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because in those days in Holland,
it was not legal to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was like a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not a big deal to do it and not to
not many people did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, we started to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, we learned about growing and
the metal hell out of life from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who went to the States and they saw
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in those days in a coffee shop
and a friend of us, he went to the States
[SPEAKER_01]: and and he saw how you guys did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody did in those days did this in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought, yeah, let's give it a
try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we were the first in Holland
to to grow under the metal highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, it was that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were we were we're looking to
live close to to the big horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: center of Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Westlands, because in Holland,
it's really we are the number one in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world horticulture and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we decided to start this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem we had, we didn't have
any seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so how do you start sourcing your
seeds and your lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes you choose what you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because the thing is, in those days,
the cannabis was only from the tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all seeded with a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you tried those seeds in Holland,
they didn't they didn't they didn't flower
[SPEAKER_01]: in time because we are quite north.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those the certificate are from
the equator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we didn't have success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but one of the guys, he went to the
States, one of our friends, because we
[SPEAKER_01]: needed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went to to New York and he had to a
certain office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet I don't call the name because it's
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said, No, man, we don't have
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he he said, Yeah, but I come from
Holland and I came specially to you to to
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after one week, he said, Okay,
okay, okay, we will give you some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were the William wonder seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those came out of New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we started to grow those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had quite not a big success,
but a little bit success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a while, the famous Sam the
screen man, you've heard from Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came to live in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and he contacted he contacted us
because he thought, when I live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland, I have to be in touch with the
seed guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those days, you had Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were the second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were basically two seed banks in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sam, he came to we became in contact
with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told us, Yeah, now I come here to
live in Holland, but I don't have a place
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you can help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I have a nice collection of
seeds, because he did a lot of breathing
[SPEAKER_01]: already in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as as his number one thing was skunk
number one, it was really the yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first variety in the world that really
somebody took the effort to to inbred it
[SPEAKER_01]: and to to to to make a selection out of a
big group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, so we were we were very
happy with those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had something from his private
stash as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, This is my private thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are only 20 seeds left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he yeah, he gave us a seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were the hayseeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hayseeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sold you some of the original
hayseeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had 20 seeds and he gave 10 to us
and he gave 10 to Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were from the same batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the same batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said those seeds that were already
like 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, this is really we need to
germinate them because because and I gave
[SPEAKER_01]: it to you because you understand how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can save the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were not really we tried the
hayseed, but we did not like it because it
[SPEAKER_01]: took too long to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very small birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, we were very glad
with the skunk number one seeds because we
[SPEAKER_01]: were used to the fluffy sativas that were
from South Africa, from Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_01]: from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were really happy to see the big
buds of the skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The density and the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was really a lot of resin and a lot
of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we decided to make a cross between
skunk number one and one of the hayseeds
[SPEAKER_01]: we had left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from this cross, we made a big
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were very happy to find one
with the smell and the taste of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hayseed and the bud structure of the skunk
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really happy that we could
grow hayseeds and dig fat buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nice thing about this,
I still have this plant and it's now 35
[SPEAKER_01]: years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's our flagship thing, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have now based a lot of crosses on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made it with this old school hayseed,
we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it smells like cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really a dark, earthy taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's a very uplifting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really a really nice plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to grow because if you
make a mistake, if your room gets too hot,
[SPEAKER_01]: it starts to flower again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really a matter of, yeah,
it's a difficult thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe that that's still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're still using it in your current
breeding program?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stopped with the Super Sativa seed clip
after about five years because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: really too, it became a little bit too
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those days, it was really,
yeah, we were a bit afraid of,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronald Reagan, the war on drugs was going
on really strong in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we quit the Super Sativa seed
club, but I kept on growing and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and all different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like three or four years ago,
my two sons, I have two sons, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: growers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, ah, let's do it again,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody knows you and some
people think you are the legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's now quite successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in Holland, we are also getting a
situation of legal growing because in
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland we have also always been on the
forefront of the growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we lost a little bit because you
guys are doing it very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, of course, now in the states and the
legal situation in a lot of states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Holland can't stay behind, man,
because we are the ones who built how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do the cannabis thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we are looking, we started a lobby
in Holland and we also tried to to change
[SPEAKER_01]: the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically wrote a law together with the
Dutch government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there is going to be a big like a
trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Dutch government has given out 10
permits to grow legal for the Dutch coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were we were lucky to one one of
the permits because 150 people applied for
[SPEAKER_01]: the permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only 10 permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and like from from 150 people,
100 didn't make it because the plan was
[SPEAKER_01]: not good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were not because you needed to to
to comply in a lot of rules because you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to know about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have to grow and big scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to do the contacts with the
coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we are very happy because then we
can do our breathing really because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have done the breathing all always in the
illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, same here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine that it's for us
difficult because we like to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also a little bit difficult to
see that people like exotic Mike,
[SPEAKER_01]: exotic genetics is really they can they
can work in the legal situation now for
[SPEAKER_01]: over three, four, five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, he has a lot of people making
seed from everywhere all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and then in Holland,
we still have the like the the strange,
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult strains to grow with the special
to profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's what we want to offer
something different because it's cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cookies everywhere nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I surely hope you guys stick with some of
the base old stuff, because that's what we
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants cookies anymore over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's tired of cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because over here it's still new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's still new over there,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like a strange, but also a comic
situation in that we went to the States to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a lot of breathing and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we sold it back to the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the States is doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have to go to the States again
to take seeds back to Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we can help there in that
situation, because we have everything over
[SPEAKER_02]: here and you don't have to fly out to get
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice that it's going all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of the super sativa seed clip
was because we were very politically
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our idea was to help the States is a
little bit strange to say, but we were in
[SPEAKER_01]: this position that we could do samey legal
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those days you had a lot of people
coming back from Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were our clients, you know,
because they ordered the seeds from us and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were the ones who really did a lot of
earlier farming in California where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still going in the same place where it's
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our idea was when we sell the seeds to
a lot of different people in the US,
[SPEAKER_01]: there will be a lot of refrigerators
stocked with seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the government, it's quite
difficult to stop this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's spreading everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those days, you didn't have the
internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you live in a certain city,
okay, you can spread the seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: give it to your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit difficult when you live in
California to make sure that also the
[SPEAKER_01]: people in Texas or Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our idea was to spread it everywhere
with the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not going to stop anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it's a beautiful idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Johnny Appleseed, modern day
Johnny Appleseed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we did, we were not in for the
money because we really were in for the
[SPEAKER_01]: love of the plants and we still are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the money was nice,
but because our business model was a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit strange because people from the
States had to send money to Holland
[SPEAKER_01]: without knowing who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had to trust us that we sent
the seeds back to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first few years, people were a
little bit reluctant to send us money
[SPEAKER_01]: because yeah, maybe who are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knew.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at one point, people from high
times, they came to came to interview us
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were in high times and they
thought, oh man, this is really,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they make it, they made a nice cover
story about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from those days, it's really,
yeah, it really exploded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got, we got like people from
all the, from everywhere in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: ordering seeds and we thought,
ah, this is really getting too big and we
[SPEAKER_01]: quit and this is because it was getting a
little bit out of hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got a little hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people from Japan,
from Australia, from Canada, from
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, they start to order seeds
because it was really the first,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really were the first ones to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a big, big success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were Robert Connell Clark,
you know him as well, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told also always the wisest thing you
did is quit with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw what happened with Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ruined his life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's really, uh, and now,
um, now we're still going strong and we
[SPEAKER_01]: are still loving the plants and we,
we are still very happy to, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to make combinations with the new
things from the States with our old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, a lot of things turned out very
well because we like to have, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: we like the layer taste, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do something with Hayes,
we can keep the Hayes taste, but also we
[SPEAKER_01]: can combine it with, uh, like Corellia
glue or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it really a thing that we
like that it's not one taste, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different tastes in one variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, and, and we are not so
afraid of doing things like, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, a lot of people are afraid to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are, it's, it's difficult,
but it's really, uh, we're waiting a few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: Americans are finally, um, being more
receptive to long flowering strains as of
[SPEAKER_02]: the past, maybe two or three years,
I've noticed Hayes are finally starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up in the U S whereas they were never
a staple here, except in, in Santa Cruz in
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, late sixties, early
seventies, mid seventies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but nowadays people want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want a little bit of that,
that tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have, we also, uh, we,
we work together with H seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know H?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, these are our friends as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're a really good company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, they are really have like,
uh, this super strong that's Sativas and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and now we're like in,
in, um, in the legal situation in the U S
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not understand why people are afraid
to from a longer flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have the space to do this,
yeah, I can imagine in the illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: situation when you don't have much space,
it's a bit, um, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can imagine that you, you want to
speed up things a little bit, but what I
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen always is, uh, it takes four
weeks longer to, to finish, but the,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the yield in there is 30, 40% more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, your results are
exactly the same as when you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short flowering varieties, because the big
the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, what we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how long to always say the,
the, the, the modern American strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: they lack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lack weight, you know, that's why we
try to make crosses with the new American
[SPEAKER_01]: strains to, to, to, to get to make plans
with a bigger real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a TV as you know how they,
how they flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The birds are arm length, and in the
cookies you have a bird, 20 centimeters
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have anything, and another bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice, but it doesn't bring weight in
the scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is very low yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high doesn't last too long either,
so a good haze hybrid with the cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring a much better high to cookies that
isn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some questions for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a lot of good memory for where
you sourced certain things or the history
[SPEAKER_02]: of certain strains that you put out?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a bit of a problem because the
old school haze clone we still have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in touch with, in Canada, a lot of
people still have the Friesland Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: People told me that a lot of people from
50, 60 years old now, that when they
[SPEAKER_01]: started to smoke, they all started with
Friesland Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I talked with somebody from Canada,
and he knows a guy in the US who still has
[SPEAKER_01]: the Beatrix George and M33.
[SPEAKER_01]: In so many years, a lot of things
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I lost a little bit of track
of where everything is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, we basically, Sam,
he provided us with seeds and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds we just took from the bags of wheat
that we bought in the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, in Amsterdam, we had a
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Durban Poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only sold cannabis from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a lot of crosses with the Durban
Poison because South Africa is also far to
[SPEAKER_01]: the south in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowering period is more or less the
same as we have in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was very nice to make crosses between
skunk number one, Durban Poison,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we gave it a nice name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was our variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not a big deal because we took the
seeds from the bags and we grew them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pollinated the one that we liked best.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a new variety because in those
days, it was not really inbredding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not really do that because,
to be honest, the demand for our seeds was
[SPEAKER_01]: so big that we even didn't have time to do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's been happening in the US
the past maybe 15 years since I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: around, I've noticed there is a,
and this is unfortunate, seriously
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunate, but every two or three years,
someone will come up and pretend to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: big collection of old SSSC stuff and then
sell it and it's all fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just happened with Beatrix Choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone just popped up with fake Beatrix
Choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably what you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not anyone's collections over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who Beatrix is, yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've studied your strains for so many
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Williams Wonder clone is still out
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That clone is still available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every once in a while, you'll find
Williams Wonder seeds that are pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: M39, still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Freesland, still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a famous one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because in Canada, I went to visit
Canada and then a guy showed me the
[SPEAKER_01]: Freesland Indica and then I was really
like, there is of course a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in all those years and the
reality is becoming better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not really very proud to see the
Freesland Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, this is not really what we like
in those days and these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think it's more special are the
Haze things because the Haze is really
[SPEAKER_01]: something different and it's also for me
as the owner of the Super Sativa C Club,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's sometimes funny that people tell me
things that I myself even don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine that because we had a lot
of different varieties and for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's different than for the collectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really like it to hear that a lot of
people are still trying to find the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: from cannabis because it's basically,
even Neville, he of course did a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: than we did because he was really the
first one and we were the second ones and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all a heads up for Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not anymore with us anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was friends with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the nice thing is also that we got
some of his last work in clone form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have the Outback Haze and that's
the one he made in Australia when he lived
[SPEAKER_01]: in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, King Atiba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ian made all those for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all working together during that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have the Haze C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have also the NL5 times Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clone that he selected from a lot of
plants, I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so like I think it's the A5 or C5,
A5?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The A5 and the C5 we also have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you do have those two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because I'm from Holland and in the
south of Holland, there is a group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who still have all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the Haze world, it's still a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody owns this, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like we are like activists,
you know, we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe in owning screens and
owning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody agrees with this,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not everybody does agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: When somebody puts a lot of effort in
breathing a strain or working a strain
[SPEAKER_01]: like many years, then he can then I
consider it that he owns it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's long bred and selected and a lot
of work put into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, Gorilla Glue is going after
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also at the point where when somebody
is selling in a seed bank, a regular seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I own it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he sells it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're buying it, you're buying the
genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because and if you don't want to sell the
genetics, you have to feminize it or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even then, I mean, if someone
feminizes your your feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you just ask shit out of luck because
you sold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I'm not really busy and protecting
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe because I also want to ask
you questions, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because do you think do we see things
happening in the states like that people
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to protect strains or genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are trying to patent feminization
techniques that they had nothing to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with creating.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are trying to patent strains as
quickly as they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trademark strain names like Koji Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But names, it's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the plant varieties were we can't
patent patent them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are many people at the forefront
of that trying to get it the second that
[SPEAKER_02]: it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll definitely be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they trying to do then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in Holland, you have like because
we have a lot of horticulture flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can you can patent if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can own a strain as long as it is
different in a lot of aspects than any
[SPEAKER_01]: other strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second thing you have to do,
you have to be able to reproduce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means if you have hundreds of
seeds of this strain, all the plants have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be the same uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an IVL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next time you show them,
they have to be the same again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think anyone in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: except for maybe CSI Humboldt and a few
others, 707 Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only probably two or three people
who are capable of even producing seed
[SPEAKER_02]: lines like that, let alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think many people are really
going to be getting the patents.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some breeders up in D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been doing it very seriously and
big for a long time that will probably be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for that in their country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to give you an example,
if you were like in Holland, we have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of big seed companies, tomato seeds and
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you if you buy a kilo tomato seeds,
you're buying 50,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you grow those 50,000 plants,
they are all 100 percent the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is not one marijuana strain
around that is uniform, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's and I don't know that marijuana
can be brought to uniformity because
[SPEAKER_02]: environment takes such a big factor in
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, of course, because of the
multi-multi-multiple hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for sure that in the cookies,
there is something from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for sure, there is some skunk number
one in it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skunk man always told me every seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we know exactly what cookies is
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very it's a simple, simple little
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to break it down to its base
components, it's going to be something
[SPEAKER_02]: like skunk one Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the smell and the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really want to say good work to the
guys who did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is, of course, difficult to make
this uniform because in the cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say the cookies, there are maybe
like 25 different varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were like the skunk number one
is all is already those already have like
[SPEAKER_01]: five, six varieties in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you bring in more parents with
all their backgrounds and grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hybridization is like there are one
million swings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep it to the in my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to keep it to a baseline like a
base effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani or a base, something like that,
you know, and cross it to it may be a poly
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it brings that down dramatically,
you know, like it's easier to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And line breed from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the Super City for Seed Club,
we are not really putting a lot of effort
[SPEAKER_01]: and inbreeding and everything,
because what we like is when I buy seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we make a cross with our age,
then you will find a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the plants is really something
special, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big LPs, they try to sell to buy
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they think then we have a uniform
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always tell them, please,
man, do phenohunting and look for a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: mother and go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have a quick question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some myths and stories over
the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the stories that came up recently
and someone made a seed company off of was
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that they were breeding for you in
Virginia to make your skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think it was true, but I had to
ask because it's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam, the skunk man, he made the skunk
number one, and he made it in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was really the first guy in the
world to grow in a big greenhouse and to
[SPEAKER_01]: do real breeding, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically the skunk number one,
the original one, there are basically two
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes, one with a pointed bird and
one with a round bird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smell and the taste, they were all
really quite uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Holland in those days, all the
breeding was done with skunk number one
[SPEAKER_01]: because it gave you a big, thick bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really skunk number one in the
80s and 90s was in every plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we ask you the history on Beatrix
Choice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, you brought it up earlier
and it's one that people like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a certain history on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is, to be honest,
I really I even don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clothes that we made.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is that we remember why we
put the name on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the name from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because Beatrix is the queen of
Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought in those days,
like you like your T-shirt, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like this in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had one Victor Barne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know Victor Barne?
[SPEAKER_02]: Victor Barne, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a nice story to tell because
in those days we had in Holland a Lockheed
[SPEAKER_01]: affair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Lockheed, that was like the
company who built airplanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Lockheed, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Lockheed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the husband of our queen was Prince
Bernhardt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like a naughty guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a lot of different wives and he was
doing a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made a deal with Lockheed and he
said, I will make sure that the Dutch
[SPEAKER_01]: government is going to buy your airplanes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pay me 10 million dollars for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Lockheed, he did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Prince Bernhardt had to use a fake
name to open a bank account to let
[SPEAKER_01]: Lockheed put this 10 million dollars on
his bank account.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he used the fake name Victor Barne.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was like a little bit like this
with them, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're telling that we can't grow wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're doing this kind of things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very politically active here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our government is very, especially in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain areas of California are still very
illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they think California, they think
legal state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a part of California that's the
Bible Belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So despite any laws, our county has
overridden the laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get caught growing,
you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so we're still very politically
active here trying to fight a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's still done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very clandestine black market in most of
the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very good friend with the people of
Humboldt seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always tell me, I mean,
everybody thinks it's legal, but still
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not legal at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scary in some places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now for me, the circle is a little bit
wrong because I started this thing more or
[SPEAKER_01]: less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm very happy that I'm part of
the group that got the permit to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: legal in Holland, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's like the circle is wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what you just saw there was you saw the
first part of our interview with Karel
[SPEAKER_09]: from Super Sativa Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt, I wasn't unable to make it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Matt did the first one.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a series of follow up questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And ideas.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so Karel was kind enough to come back
and chat with us again.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's possible this might be ongoing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, we have a two part series.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first was Matt.
[SPEAKER_09]: The second will be primarily me,
although Matt might be in it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: And after that, we'll have some commentary
where we talk about what we learned and
[SPEAKER_09]: what we were excited about hearing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt and a lot of others, you know,
we read the we read the catalogs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk and talk about various things,
but we're all a little younger to have
[SPEAKER_09]: actually experienced like basically you
and the seed bank kind of starting off
[SPEAKER_01]: like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of like, you know, you and Neville at
the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_09]: You two kind of started off what we
consider to be like the modern seed era.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like before you, we were really curious as
to like certain questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, for instance, you know,
you mentioned before, when did you when
[SPEAKER_09]: did you first start seeing like Americans
come in and bringing their seed lines like
[SPEAKER_09]: skunk one and and the Durbin or Afghani
one or these different things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started in 1985.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, after one year or so,
Sam the skink man, he came to live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he wrote us a letter because we
were running an ad, an advertisement in
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Neville, the seed bank did it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sam thought that when I go to Holland,
I let's hook up with those two guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's talk about seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met last time in those days,
we didn't have much seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only seeds we have were from the bags
of seeds that we bought in the coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all Sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, Sam the skink man
brought all the seeds from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the next one was Robert
Connell Clark, a friend of Sam the skink
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, a few more came.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nice thing about the seeds came
from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we started to send it to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's again that we look into the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy seeds again from you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were first more liberal than you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1985, it never has been legal to grow
in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 1985, in the beginning,
not a lot of people knew about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, we could do what we want
because nobody knew about it and nobody,
[SPEAKER_01]: even the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let us do what we wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Amsterdam, there were a few more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Werner Breining, of course, he was really
the first one with the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he didn't, it's international.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only for Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was really, yeah, he's older than
me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also started the first coffee shop,
the first grow shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the Positronix?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Positronix, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the coffee shop is the Mellow Yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: He invented more or less, not a Rick
Simpson oil, but yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls it made weed, made weed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, he has a good, he really does a
lot of good work because he basically
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced to the Dutch patients how to
make your own oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to teach the people how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants that everybody is an independent,
an independent from pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to make your own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fully agree with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to come back to the question,
Sam, the screen man, he's really the man
[SPEAKER_01]: who brought everything to Amsterdam,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any interactions with Kees
Hawker from Lowland Seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kees Hawker, he's older already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the thing is, they tried to push
the as we call it, the native weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically grow in your own backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were more, we thought the Dutch way
is to cold and to rainy and to wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's go indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw it happening in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were readers of High Times
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were lucky enough to have the
American bookstore in The Hague where we
[SPEAKER_01]: lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went there every month to buy the
newest copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were sure what in America was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's more or less how we started.
[SPEAKER_09]: For us, skunk wand and haze and those type
of things are very, very famous strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they kind of became like the backbone
of what you guys were doing over there for
[SPEAKER_09]: a while.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it like to do those things at
first?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were very happy, especially with the
skunk number one, because we were not used
[SPEAKER_01]: to see this kind of big buds and stable
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, yeah, you can imagine if you grow
outdoors and all Sativa strain from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It flowers in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in December, it's cold and rain and
snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't see we never ever had seen
even buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a big game changer when he
came with his stuff and especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk number one and the haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave us 10 seeds, the last seed he
saved from his favorite variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave the other 10 seeds to Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we didn't pay too much attention
to the haze because it was long flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: and only very, very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really we were so happy with
the skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost forgot about the haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily enough, we made crosses
between skunk number one and haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because we had 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, two times we were busted by the
police and they took all our hazes and we
[SPEAKER_01]: had only one left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even don't know anymore if it was if it
was a boy or a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we already made the seeds with the
skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still have a lot of seeds that we
made between crosses between our 10 hazes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to germinate it and it really
doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem was I kept them outside the
refrigerator for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I put them in the refrigerator and I
now I still have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe be some of your listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in my opinion, the seeds,
when there is only one cell alive still,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, basically you could reproduce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the government, I don't think they
want to help us with this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they find a seed of wheat in a pyramid
in Egypt, yeah, we'll make sure that this
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to work again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with cannabis seeds, I still we still
have to find somebody who can help us
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think the you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, tissue cultures from life
somewhere in those seeds still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it would be nice to germinate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave it to a few people who told me we
will manage because I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a pity, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to come back to your Durban
poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, we had an Amsterdam coffee
shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing they sold was wheat
from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the names anymore,
but the major thing they sold Durban
[SPEAKER_01]: poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we had quite a few crosses
in our first catalogue with Durban poison,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we bought wheat from them and
together with skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the crosses with skunk number one gave
us more early flowering, bigger and a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was basically a winner combination
with skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what any of the smell
profiles of the different skunk number
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that you popped back in the day were
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the skunk number one was really like
the name tells it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stinks like skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so back then it actually smelled like
skunks, like North American skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I never have smelled the
skunk anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was more about that it was so
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really strong, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my local haze that I have, you can
still smell in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smell the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strong smell of the skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then together with the haze,
the old school haze is a very funny plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you make an analysis of it,
there's only a protein that's the only
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene that's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not too much as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you smoke it, it's really the
strongest smell and taste that I have ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a big mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our knowledge about terpenes,
how is it possible that the plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: only one and not a lot of it can smell so
strong and taste so strong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the answer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, when you first got it,
it was skunk number one was an early
[SPEAKER_09]: finishing big bud, very pretty.
[SPEAKER_09]: It smelled like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it smell like did it smell like citrus
too?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more the dark side of the like the
earthy, woody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not, no, no, not any sweetness,
not any citrus in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what we're familiar with as
younger people is skunk number one smells
[SPEAKER_09]: like floral.
[SPEAKER_09]: It smells sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: It smells.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're saying that what Sam brought
over first is very different than what
[SPEAKER_09]: ended up being common in Europe later as
skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because skunk number one, there are still
a lot of seeds being around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think or they know, I don't know,
that they still have skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is no skunk number one anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only skunk number one that is around
is very diluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing to compare with the skunk number
one anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe when Sam the skunk man listens,
he tells that I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have never seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no real skunk number one anymore
around.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when he went there, he gave seeds
to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: He gave some seeds to Neville.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like he gave some seeds to
Wernard from Positronix, Smelly Yellow.
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the community in Amsterdam then?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did everyone know each other?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is we didn't live in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't live in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Amsterdam scene was more about outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we were the first ones in Holland
to grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam taught a lot of people how to grow in
a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since Sam arrived in Holland, people
started to grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do it without a lot of trouble
because nobody knew about how it smells
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the first five years that Sam
was around, a lot of greenhouse growing
[SPEAKER_01]: was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically teached everybody in Holland
how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't grow in a greenhouse because in
our opinion, we thought it was better to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it indoors and nobody can see it and
it's more safe to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, all the greenhouses
were always busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could do one crop, maybe second crop
was already busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland is a small country and there is no
countryside at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greenhouses are always close to a
village, close to a town with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people around.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people live in one square mile.
[SPEAKER_09]: In half the country, it seems like you
reclaimed from the sea.
[SPEAKER_09]: Besides haze and skunk, what else did you
get from Sam?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not get anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville got early pearl from Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early pearl and a few other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were not too much in touch with Neville
because Neville's approach was different
[SPEAKER_01]: than our approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were underground people and we were not
really too fond to receive a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People we don't know in our house.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, Neville had the cannabis
castle and everybody more or less was
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you came with a lot of
money to buy seeds, everybody was welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were always more like, let's try to
keep it underground and let's try to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a more or less safe way because we
didn't want to get caught and we wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: go on in this business forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville was more of that devil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who came to his house
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't know if he knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of Americans in those days,
they came to Amsterdam and everybody was
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome at Neville's place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were more careful too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Besides Sam, where were some other
sources?
[SPEAKER_09]: In the previous conversation you had with
Matt, you told that a lot of stuff you
[SPEAKER_09]: got, you were getting off seeds from buds
out of coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there any other people or sources?
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you started making Super Sativa Seed
Club, were people coming to find you and
[SPEAKER_09]: trade seeds with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were coming to find this,
but they couldn't find this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only one who could find this was
Rosenthal and George Cervantes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: chief editor of the High Times,
Stephen Hager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the only three people who could
visit us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understood what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That leads me to another question.
[SPEAKER_09]: In your catalog, you have something called
Oakland Indica.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just curious as to where you got that
or where it came from.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of clients and we received a
lot of letters in those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few times people sent us seeds,
but only a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Oakland was somebody from Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, we got like 100 letters
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really fun for us to read all those
letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we asked people to help us to
distribute the seeds in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just reading the letters and
thought, this guy is a nice guy because he
[SPEAKER_01]: understands how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really nice job for me to read
all those letters and to answer them as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, we still get letters from people
from all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, nice to see you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that we bought this and
that from you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started again a few years ago,
we got a letter from somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, nowadays, Mother Nature is legal
in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really thought a guy who writes a
letter and says, Mother Nature is legal
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be illegal, but now we are
happy that it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the letters that we really
liked of people who understood how crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: it is to make Mother Nature illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got about the Durban Thai High
Flyer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that was one of your most famous
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still see it around today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any memories surrounding it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this was a very sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure sativa, of course, and also because
Durban is so in the south of the world
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's almost in the same latitude than
Holland is, but in the north.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowering times, they are more or less
the same than our flowering time because
[SPEAKER_01]: our harvest, our autumn starts in
September.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also the harvest, it's getting
colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were lucky to have the Durban flowering
so early.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Durban is the one sativa that's an
early finisher, so it worked well in
[SPEAKER_09]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The combination with the Thai,
because the Thai is a very, very late
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, then it's finished like half
October or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice for us, of course,
because in October, sometimes when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: lucky, the weather is still good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but our main customers in the US
were the people from California,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Vietnam veterans, people back from
Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started to do the guerrilla farming
and they made money with it as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they send us nice amounts of money.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: From our perspective back then,
especially Indicas and things like that
[SPEAKER_09]: were pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though California and America,
there was a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: People didn't know each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the most interesting things about
what happened with you guys for us is
[SPEAKER_09]: that, like you were saying before,
a bunch of stuff flowed from America over
[SPEAKER_09]: to Holland and went everywhere in America.
[SPEAKER_08]: It went to the South, it went to the
Northern New York, it went to the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we did this, because we thought
in those days, there is no internet,
[SPEAKER_01]: so your friends live close to you in the
same town, so you can swap seats with your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, but it doesn't spread the whole
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we were starting, we got letters
from everywhere, Alaska, Texas,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought when all the refrigerators in
the States are filled with seats,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a difficult thing to stop this
movement.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about the Kuiper or the Kuiber Pass?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we called it the Kuiper because the
plant was not upright, but it was laying
[SPEAKER_01]: down more or less.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's why I always assumed it was the
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was not about the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really about the morphologic
aspects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, a plant is more or less like a
Christmas tree, but this one was like
[SPEAKER_01]: bending over and laying down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like this kind of plants because
they give you a big harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they get a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's room for buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kuiber, we crossed it with an Afghani,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Holland, the hash from Afghanistan was
really very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where we got the seeds from.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you guys ever grow flowers for coffee
shops or did you just focus on seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were growing for the coffee shops as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They liked our indoor wheat because it was
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, we were worrying a little
bit about the fact that our wheat was
[SPEAKER_01]: green because people were used to buying
marijuana was always brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half-rotten wheat, as we call it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our indoor marijuana was green.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought, oh, nobody's going to buy this
because the only green marijuana we knew
[SPEAKER_01]: was the native wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the wheat that we grew in our
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't have buds, it was only leaves,
and it was green.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were afraid that people thought our
wheat was a native wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to make it brown to be able to
sell it, but after a year, everybody said,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, the green one is the best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much better than the brown one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about the color, we buy it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were really worried about the green
color.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were really worried because the part
about that is that everything was so new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it was new.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Zins Emilia that I saw in
Holland, that was somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: One year, we were lucky enough to have a
good September in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, it's raining in September
already, but in this September,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the coffee shop where I worked,
somebody came with a garbage bag full of
[SPEAKER_01]: big buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not primped at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, where does this come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time we saw a green big
bud plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was also, I think, a Durban poison or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was lucky to grow some Durban poison
seeds in a year that we had a very nice
[SPEAKER_01]: September, so the plant was safe to
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really the first time that I saw
Zins Emilia, as we call it in Spain.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the ways you got into weed was by
working in a coffee shop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I worked in a coffee shop when I was
like 18 years or 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then one of our customers came to me and
said, I'm a reader of High Times magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw how they grow plants already because
Ed Rosenthal was one of the first to start
[SPEAKER_01]: all this, I think, in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy said, I bought a metal hell out
lamp because we have a big horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: center here in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days, the greenhouse grower,
they used it to grow cactus, the metal
[SPEAKER_01]: hell out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went there to buy a lamp and he said,
I want to grow it and I want to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, I live in a squat house and
let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it started because this guy,
he was a reader of High Times magazine and
[SPEAKER_01]: saw it in High Times.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of Super Sativa Seed Club's work was
all done indoors, whether you were growing
[SPEAKER_09]: buds for coffee shops or whether you were
making seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: You kept it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too cold in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a greenhouse, Holland is too crowded to
grow in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody got caught always in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you growing in garages?
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you growing in bedrooms?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you convert it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had garages and at one point we bought
a house specially to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were squatters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what squatters are?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a squatter, you always have a
house.
[SPEAKER_09]: You squatted in the house and then you set
up some lights and you set up some rooms
[SPEAKER_09]: to do breeding and grow weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: You sold the weed to the coffee shops and
you sold seeds, catalogs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were squatters, but we earned a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were not in it for the money,
but it was nice to have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of money came to us, of course,
but it was not really the basic thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The funny thing for us is that now there's
so many seed companies in America and
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a lot of seed companies in Europe
and everything like that, but when you
[SPEAKER_09]: guys started and when Neville started,
there was really only you two out there
[SPEAKER_09]: that was easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you said, if you went to Positronix,
if you went to Holland and went directly
[SPEAKER_09]: to certain coffee shops, maybe you could
get some seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in order to order things, there was
only two.
[SPEAKER_09]: That your company stuff and Neville's
company stuff got spread so far and wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when Neville stopped, Sensi Seeds took
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bought basically, that's how Sensi
Seeds started.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bought Neville's stock and then they
started in the name Sensi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ben Dronkers, the guy who started
this, this is really a big thanks to Ben
[SPEAKER_01]: because he was really the guy with the
biggest balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went on where we started, where we
stopped.
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you think that did Neville sell his
company to Ben and Alan because of the
[SPEAKER_09]: trouble he got in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the community back then, was it a small
enough community that you were close to a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of these people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but the thing is, I said before,
we had our own group of people and we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't live in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't live in Amsterdam, you lived in
different... Yeah, we lived in The Hague.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's close to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, we tried to stay out of all
those groups.
[SPEAKER_09]: You tried to keep your head and stay
quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that was the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were not behaving like rockstar or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just squatters running a cannabis
seed business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how did Jorge Cervantes and Ed
Rosenthal, how did they find you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they write you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they sent us a letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they write it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in those days, you wrote letters
to people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put a stamp on the envelope and
then you put it in the mailbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a good idea that we go back to
this kind of communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nobody can listen to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they bring seeds, too?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or did they want to just come up?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they didn't bring seeds, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a nice anecdote about Jorge
Cervantes, because he came to visit us and
[SPEAKER_01]: he asked us to show him the Dutch
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in those days, the Dutch
greenhouse, they were growing under HPS
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had greenhouses with 10,000 HPS lights
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't ever see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we gave him a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he showed up in the tour with a nice
T-shirt, cannabis, USA, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put on some different
T-shirts, man, because we can't show you
[SPEAKER_01]: around in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wearing this T-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, oh, why that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legal in Holland, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not legal at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody thinks it's legal, but it is not
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to teach him a little bit how to
behave in Holland.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the same issue in California,
where I live.
[SPEAKER_09]: When medical first happened 20 years ago,
a lot of people thought it was legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it really wasn't legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of like Holland.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was permitted, but you still get in
trouble any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people from California,
and they always tell me it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was still whether or not the cop wanted
to be nice to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: They could treat you any which way they
wanted.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was kind of the same about Holland,
I'm sure, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It all depended on the attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we tried to keep it a
little bit underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we wanted to go out with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a family and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that type of guy who wants to be
in the big picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me either.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel you on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So after you started breeding at
Supersativa Seed Club for a while and you
[SPEAKER_09]: realized that you got popular,
did you start keeping a lot of breeding
[SPEAKER_09]: males and breeding females?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we had like a nice collection
of males and females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those days, we did not do the
feminized breeding that didn't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was not so very difficult to
breeding that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sometimes did a little bit in
breeding, but not too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically did female hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best ones we liked, we crossed
with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was happy with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for a lot of people, our
customers, it's either nothing or
[SPEAKER_01]: something from Amsterdam that really gives
you nice flowers, nice buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people sent us photos and sent us
letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the photos they sent us, they were
really nice photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people were involved in your
company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had two people and like four or
five people helping us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a little collective.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the biggest part of it, how many houses
did you have or how many different places
[SPEAKER_09]: were you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like five, six different places to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did not do that because in those
days, there were also people who really,
[SPEAKER_01]: after five years or so, a lot of people
that came in, they rented big warehouses
[SPEAKER_01]: and put 200 lamps in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did it on a smaller scale because
we were not growing that much wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were more growing seeds in those days.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a lot of, you could call
them American seed companies these days
[SPEAKER_09]: that exist just like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's some basement.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a few bedroom house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I see a lot of people,
they have some clones and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses and a new seed company is born.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really old.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: How long does it flower for?
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 weeks and then the better do with one
week of 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 is better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how did it, I mean, 35 years old,
I'm always fascinated by how things
[SPEAKER_09]: survive because for us in America,
it seems like every five or 10 years,
[SPEAKER_09]: the seed game reinvents itself and you
can't get what you used to be able to get.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it just such a nice cut and there's
such a nice plant that various people
[SPEAKER_09]: saved it and passed it around?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it something?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been always in like two or three
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, it was more like a
group of people we worked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's still around and we let
them, we have our mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's like three or four months
old, we take a new cut, we throw away the
[SPEAKER_01]: old plant and we start from with a little
clone again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few friends of mine, they have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, because you can imagine in
35 years, there are lots of things
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are proud of it to still have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are now working on trying to breed
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working with a few American
varieties because we like from those days,
[SPEAKER_01]: we like the big firm buds with a lot of
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes it lacks a little bit of
flavor, a little bit of taste and smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we are trying to put the smell of
the old school haze and the high
[SPEAKER_01]: preferable as well and the taste into a
new and into the American varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that takes a while, but it's really
interesting to see a plant that grows like
[SPEAKER_01]: a cookie or something American style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with the old school haze,
taste and smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a thing that we are working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe people, some people tell you,
why do you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You try to keep it like it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to, because at the end of the
day, a lot of people are working
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice to have a big yield,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also a fluffy bud is nowadays
considered like bee quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't understand that at
the end of the day, you grab your bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: you put it in a paper and you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't really a big deal how the bud
looks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big deal is taste and how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you agree and I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people, the eye also wants
something.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the way that social media works now,
a lot of times the only things that people
[SPEAKER_09]: see of different buds are pictures.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might look very ugly, even though it
might work wonderfully and make you very
[SPEAKER_09]: happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it might take great.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't tell that through the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because nowadays if you have like
five different varieties, four of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: American things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is a Sativa thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody says, the Sativa thing,
we don't want to have it because it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially because I'm 63 years old
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally, I think it's normal that
younger people like other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also want to show things from the
past.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, for instance, it's really
interesting because for us, skunk one,
[SPEAKER_09]: to bring it back again is very,
very, very different from what you
[SPEAKER_09]: experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I've experienced skunk one
like you remember it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The time that we got a hold of it,
what you remember was gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that happens a lot where if you don't
have old things or people aren't saving
[SPEAKER_09]: old cuttings or you can't get old seeds to
sprout, then the way people remember
[SPEAKER_09]: something, it's just gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: How long ago did you get excited again
about maybe you could restart Super Sativa
[SPEAKER_09]: Seed Club in a new form?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we already started it, but we don't
sell in the US anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those were the wild days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, it's not a good idea to sell
something in the US for a moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could change.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're slowly moving in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, have you ever heard of Ditch
Passion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because we were together with Ditch
Passion, they are friends of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are really a very successful seed
company, but they don't sell one seed in
[SPEAKER_01]: the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know that half of the visitors
of the website comes from the US.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't sell one seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, that will change in the next
four or so years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like America... It's complicated
in the US, man, with those federal laws,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's really not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe one day things change and then
we can... Because it's of course crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: that half of the visitors of a website,
it comes from the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want the wild seeds, but we don't do
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, you're making stuff for the
Holland market now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the European market.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were talking in the previous interview
you did with Matt, you were talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: how you sort of like recollected some
other hazes besides... Yeah, because now
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a good position, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people and I know all the
haze hats from Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, you're certainly of that
generation that probably known these
[SPEAKER_09]: people for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we are happy that the haze people
always are the people who really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how important it is to save
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is still a lot of stuff around,
because we have like five different loans
[SPEAKER_01]: still.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which ones are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the old school haze, we have the
NL5 times haze, and we have the haze C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the haze A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the boy as everybody thinks,
but because we have the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the Outback haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the last thing Neville made.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last thing he made.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the haze C is the famous boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is there is a lot of confusion
going on always about the hazes,
[SPEAKER_01]: boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we have is the haze A and the
haze C and it's both girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you have the A5 and C5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't have it, but my friends
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really when we want to use it to
make a cross or something, we can have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a group of people and everybody
knows each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from the start.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you're talking about the girls
that are A and C, you're not talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: A5 or C5.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really especially the haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I like best is the Outback haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Outback haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because the Outback haze is really
the incense smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the incense smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes you high, totally high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really when you smoke it,
then you think, hmm, I'm not stoned at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then half an hour later, you think,
huh, where was I?
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't do anything, but where was I?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a female you got from friends or is
that a female and a C?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I don't think you know them.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's called Miska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miska is a famous activist here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's from France.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an older lady and she's really an
activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was the best friend of Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Neville gave this to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since she passed away, Neville passed
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave it to us also because he's quite
old already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like what Sam did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave it to somebody who can handle it,
you know, who knows how to save it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you planning on doing some breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing breeding because we are now
doing breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's feminized breeding because when
you have two girls, there is no man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to do feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have now two and still,
yeah, I think it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: successful project because when you're
breeding, you have to establish a few
[SPEAKER_01]: girls already, not too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our goals are all the high,
the smell and the taste.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are my top three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice when there is a lot of resin to
be seen, but we don't go for a flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: time or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, because now we also can do some
breeding in legal situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we don't have to worry about the
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because a lot of people have DNA
genetics, you know them, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they are also friends of us and they
said, yeah, it's nice what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's going to be a problem to sell
those seeds because nowadays people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to spend 12 or 13 weeks waiting for
their harvest anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're growing legal like you
guys can do this there, why should you
[SPEAKER_01]: bother about the flowering time?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: For a long time, they were right.
[SPEAKER_09]: People didn't want things that went longer
than eight to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they have to run with the
police on their heels and make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes in fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a lot of people now that are
willing to do 12, 13, even 14 week strains
[SPEAKER_09]: if they're nice enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are getting excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also regarding weight, the extra three
weeks will give you a 40% extra weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best yielding varieties are the Sativa
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all love a little bit about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sometimes making a little bit fun
about the new American strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like them, but they don't yield.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's a lot of them that don't
yield.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: So your skunk haze, the haze in it is from
one of the 10 seeds that Sam grew a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing closer to the real haze
than the skunk haze that I have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it seems like most people in
Holland ended up using a lot of Neville's
[SPEAKER_09]: hybrids of haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those would be a lot of the cuts that
got saved.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as a result of that, that means that
most haze is only from one or two plants.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have haze that's not even his,
which is pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the difference between our haze
and Neville's haze is Neville did all his
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses with Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did it at skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Northern Lights, you can also see in
like A5 and C5 and all those, it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Northern Light in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Northern Light is not really a plant
with a nice taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a metallic taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really not, the turps and the
crosses that Neville made are not so nice
[SPEAKER_01]: than the turps and the skunk haze,
because the skunk was a really turpy
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were ready that our line is with
skunk number one and Neville's lines are
[SPEAKER_01]: with Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Northern Lights came from the US.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there coffee shops and stuff like that
where people can still get your skunk haze
[SPEAKER_09]: on any kind of basis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still available.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if people were to go to, you could
find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a few people grow it because it's
complicated to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really need to have your climate under
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in an illegal situation, it's not so
very easy because then you need to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with airco units, you know, because the
skunk haze, when the temperature rises
[SPEAKER_01]: above 28 Celsius, then they start to run
the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means then it gets very fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you get like thin branches
and then you start again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when this happens, after eight weeks
of flowering, again, 12 weeks of flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're talking about 20 weeks and
that's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a very difficult plant to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have too much nutrients,
they start to scratch and they start to do
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy things.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do it the right way, it takes 12 or
13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the right thing is not one hour
above 28 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have one day, when your airco
breaks down or something, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what excites you about your new venture
with Super Sativa Seed Club?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you working with your son or are you
working with... I work with my son.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and also we are very close to get
the permit to grow in Holland legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because now the Dutch government
issued 10 permits to grow legal for the
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shops in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were lucky enough to win the
lottery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lottery.
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 people applied for the license and
only 40 went through the first round
[SPEAKER_01]: because you need to be able to grow a lot
of wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have the skills to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have the contracts in the
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically there were 40 people
left and then they made a lottery and we
[SPEAKER_01]: were lucky enough to win one of the 10
permits.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you win it, does that mean that at
some point in the future, like Matt and I
[SPEAKER_09]: could fly to Holland and we could buy
Super Sativa Seed Club weed at coffee
[SPEAKER_09]: shops and it would be branded and we'd
know it was from you and you grew it in a
[SPEAKER_09]: legal facility and then you'd sell it to
like Damkring or somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's got to be very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a government investment, so it takes
a little bit longer, as you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are waiting, waiting, waiting,
waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a few weeks or months we will get the
permit and then we do it in a peaceful
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lifetime of waiting for that,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because for me especially it's very
nice because then the circle is round.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, California is the same way.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just become legal, but a lot of
money, a lot of rules, a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations, a lot of government involved,
a lot of permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were lucky enough to have the example
of Canada and the US to tell our
[SPEAKER_01]: government, if you want to make this a
success, don't make the same mistakes as
[SPEAKER_01]: they did in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in Canada, people from the black
market can't be involved in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here in Holland, we told the
government, without people from the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market, this is not going to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people from the black market,
they know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, where does the government
can get information from?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't read the information about these
kinds of things in the paper, so you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk with people from the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically helped the government to make
this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did, you worked with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our government is wise enough to
understand that they can't do this without
[SPEAKER_01]: the black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then if they make it legal,
will you mostly be going in greenhouses
[SPEAKER_09]: like traditional gutters?
[SPEAKER_01]: We will do a combination of greenhouse and
indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And indoor growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: All organic, we work 100% organic,
huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you call it bio over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's bio here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's called bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and then the circle is round.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, if you want to wrap it up here,
that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was wonderful to hear these stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's keep in touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an amazing interview, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
All
[SPEAKER_02]: right, that concludes Nato's part of the
interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we're going to go over some
of the highlights of the interview,
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we picked out and thought were
very, very unique and otherwise important
[SPEAKER_02]: to highlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about some things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, probably in no particular order,
but one of the really interesting parts
[SPEAKER_09]: for me was hearing him talk about the
imported weed from South Africa and
[SPEAKER_09]: Durban.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that, you know, you and I have talked
a bunch in the past about how we thought
[SPEAKER_09]: most of the Durban in Amsterdam came from
what Mel Frank gave to Sam Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: We thought that's what proliferated most
of what was being used back then.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so while certainly that was
proliferated over there and plenty of
[SPEAKER_09]: people sold it and bred with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we find out that there was literally a
Durban poison coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then Carell and others were getting bag
seeds from seeded cannabis from Durban.
[SPEAKER_09]: And using in their own work.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it significantly widens the gene pool
of what we thought.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it also could lead to where,
you know, Mel talked extensively about how
[SPEAKER_09]: his Durban was much more anise,
much more licorice in flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's not sure why the Dutch bred it in
the way that they did.
[SPEAKER_09]: But with that tidbit of information,
it's possible that his was anise.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's an anise side to Durban,
but then there's also a more turpentine
[SPEAKER_09]: leaning Durban that came from South Africa
and was found in seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that could account for the vast
differences between those two Durban
[SPEAKER_09]: families.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's all kind of gotten the same
classification.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as we know, just because it's from the
same region doesn't mean it's remotely the
[SPEAKER_09]: same whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was that was pretty amazing
information because we've us and others
[SPEAKER_09]: have assumed for a long time that most
people were selling the same Durban
[SPEAKER_09]: poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the one of the points that I
thought was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that's been kind of
mythical ever since SSC kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, moved away from the scene in
that, you know, there was a lot of rumors
[SPEAKER_02]: building up about why that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people coming out and saying,
I worked for SSC and I was SSC America or
[SPEAKER_02]: my uncle, you know, or my uncle's bred
certain lines for SSC in Virginia or
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was fascinating to hear
that there were no Americans involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: SSC because that's been a rumor that's
built up and many a few at least companies
[SPEAKER_02]: have been started off that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, certainly there's more than more
than one person has had claims of that
[SPEAKER_09]: level.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was interesting to hear that while
they did source stuff from America,
[SPEAKER_09]: like apparently, as we heard, Williams
Wonder came from New York, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_09]: cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd never heard that part before.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I had neither.
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously he talked about all skunk
coming from California and the Sam Robb
[SPEAKER_09]: group, you know, to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does seem a little bit like
Neville.
[SPEAKER_09]: They collected they collected some things
and he he talked it was pretty cool how he
[SPEAKER_09]: talked about people would straight write
him letters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's how he met made most of his
American connections was people like Ed or
[SPEAKER_09]: whoever writing them letters and wanting
to come see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine just being able to write
in a letter, being like, hey, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_02]: come visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, bam, you're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're at the gas.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are sending in seeds or buds.
[SPEAKER_09]: So America certainly contributed to what
they had to offer.
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently, I mean, he said,
you know, all their breeding was done in
[SPEAKER_09]: five or six homes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you know, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other little tidbit that's not really
like seed specific, but makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: sense was, you know, when he talked about
how easy it was to get busted in
[SPEAKER_09]: greenhouses, because all of Holland is
highly developed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so a greenhouse is in a neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And living in Mendocino County and anybody
that lives in the western part of America,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're pretty spread out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's lots of remote rural areas.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's lots of places you can do things.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy property where you can get
away with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was pretty it was interesting to
when you think of a society that's so much
[SPEAKER_09]: older than ours.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've just populated every good part
of the land.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's really nowhere to hide.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for them, in order to not get busted,
it was I mean, he basically said it was
[SPEAKER_09]: like you were one and done at most of
those places.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite parts was when you were
interviewing him and he was talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you can go over it a little bit more
because you were doing the interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when he was talking about the green
bud and not being able to sell green bud
[SPEAKER_02]: because it wasn't what they were used to.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you see my face on the video,
I think my eyes are probably as big as
[SPEAKER_09]: saucers because one of the things that's
interesting in talking to like the you
[SPEAKER_09]: know, what we've talked about is like the
pioneer generation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we is, you know, like Rob Clark
and some of these guys that were writing
[SPEAKER_09]: the Bible for breeding is just how new it
all was.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to think that in the mid 80s,
as they first grew weed for themselves,
[SPEAKER_09]: that was the first time any of them had
seen green bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because brown and gold or red or various
kinds of cure or whatever, that was the
[SPEAKER_09]: standard.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no other color.
[SPEAKER_09]: They might not even know that it looked
that way when it was fresh.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they grow homegrown and it comes out
the way homegrown does.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not even sure they're going to
be able to sell it because no one's ever
[SPEAKER_02]: seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they didn't even know if it would
get them high when they first looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: it, if it was so different.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I mean, so that just goes to
speak to the level of pioneering that they
[SPEAKER_09]: were trying to have to figure all this
stuff out.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other part that's just a little
tidbit, but I found like endlessly
[SPEAKER_09]: amusing, honestly, is that obviously in an
American weed culture, we can kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: trace a lot of strains back.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then there's like a nickname,
you know, where NL five skunk one doesn't
[SPEAKER_09]: stay that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets nicknamed something else.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something maybe this NL five haze gets
nicknamed dog shit or electric boogaloo or
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, we have this whole
countercultural thing in America of
[SPEAKER_09]: relating our strains to various pop
culture stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's current for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to hear that whole story about
Victor Barn and the way that and the way
[SPEAKER_09]: that they that whose name it was and this
hustle and how they had to have a name to
[SPEAKER_09]: deposit all these millions, obviously not
knowing Holland, you know, culture like
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I never had any idea that that was related
to anything like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does tie in to the fact that we
people have always had kind of a knack to
[SPEAKER_09]: pick funny tongue in cheek kind of names
for wheat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that was kind of like the fuck you
to the Queen of Holland.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So punk rock is that, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, so both those things, both those
names that traditions has continued
[SPEAKER_09]: throughout the decades.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are always coming up with clever
plays on the culture that they're in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so while, you know, Holland weed
culture and American weed culture is
[SPEAKER_09]: obviously quite different, it was pretty
neat to hear that they should be share
[SPEAKER_09]: that sort of, you know, and on top of
that, too, I'll just say as a general
[SPEAKER_09]: sense, everything he said about his
attitude towards weed and their approach
[SPEAKER_09]: towards things and all that, like I pretty
much agree with.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was obvious talking to him.
[SPEAKER_09]: His heart was in the right place.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were pretty countercultural people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were trying to get away with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were trying to overgrow or change
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my my favorite part that
endeared me to him was his little activism
[SPEAKER_09]: nature.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, even even for I mean,
obviously, there was a financial component
[SPEAKER_09]: for him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in a way, it started a countercultural
revolution.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why people are so interested in
Super Sativa Seed Club is because so many
[SPEAKER_09]: legends exist of weed grown in Canada and
America of those strains by people that
[SPEAKER_09]: they bought from them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they played a pretty big role.
[SPEAKER_09]: Them and Neville are really the two groups
that started spreading all this seed
[SPEAKER_09]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that that's pretty important because
they laid the foundation for what came
[SPEAKER_09]: after.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's also it was also interesting
because we've already you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: we we always wondered.
[SPEAKER_09]: But hearing how when they saw what
happened in Neville and they saw Green
[SPEAKER_09]: Merchant and they saw the international
police pressure, that that's what made
[SPEAKER_09]: them decide to disband for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And not continue because they saw,
you know, the price that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_09]: pioneers paid had to do this kind of
stuff, you know, was was pretty intense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing I want to mention just
before I forget and that this might be
[SPEAKER_09]: really pertinent because it's kind of
experiencing a resurgence.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, when he was talking about
his skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So first of all, that's another piece of
evidence that, you know, there was at
[SPEAKER_09]: least three people that seemed to get haze
from Sam Skunkman when he came over to
[SPEAKER_09]: Holland the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have we have Bernard,
Neville, and Correll.
Correll.
[SPEAKER_09]: And and, you know, they all, you know,
their stories all are all similar.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was interesting to hear that that maybe
there wasn't even that many haze seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: given out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, maybe that leads to the fact
that he didn't bring over that that many.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kind of hesitant, you know,
and only wanted to give out so many before
[SPEAKER_09]: he could make his own breeding and
increase it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we were able to talk to him about
it, it would it would actually answer a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully in the future, he'd be into
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing that I think for all the
modern haze freaks out there, because with
[SPEAKER_09]: the A5 and C5 sneaking out and a lot of
people breeding Cuban black haze and NL5
[SPEAKER_09]: haze, I think is having quite a bit of a
resurgence as PIF or church or different
[SPEAKER_09]: things like that is how we talk to about
how this skunk haze that they've had for
[SPEAKER_09]: 35 years, if you grew it under,
you know, in America, in American terms,
[SPEAKER_09]: 82 degrees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you grew it cold,
it only took about 12, 12 and a half weeks
[SPEAKER_09]: to finish and it formed nice buds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let it creep above 82 for even an hour
or two.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've got a running long sativa,
20 plus week.
[SPEAKER_09]: They would add another eight weeks,
a couple months.
[SPEAKER_09]: So wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they, you know, it was really
interesting to hear that because there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of people playing with hazes right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that holds true, I wonder if people
ran rooms in the low to mid 70s and were
[SPEAKER_09]: militant about keeping it that low.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of people that run CO2 in
their rooms.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of data out there where you
might run your room in the low to mid 80s
[SPEAKER_09]: to get VPD, you know, or to get more use
out of your CO2 and try to rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that might be the exact bad approach
for running some of these old hazes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe if, you know, people are
listening and interested and you have
[SPEAKER_09]: hazes, try running them in the low to mid
70s and see if they form a little
[SPEAKER_09]: different and see if they finish faster,
because the difference between 12 and 20
[SPEAKER_09]: weeks is a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, so it's also interesting in
that, you know, maybe we can eventually
[SPEAKER_09]: get to work on some of his stuff over
here, but most people's haze stuff comes
[SPEAKER_09]: from the plants that Neville found.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it was crazy to hear that the skunk
haze that he has is a survivor from a haze
[SPEAKER_09]: seed that he found.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not haze A or haze C.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not haze A or it's haze C.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another haze that is now trapped in
genetics that maybe could be used.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the issues with haze are
inbreeding because there's only a parent
[SPEAKER_09]: or two.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you only have a couple of parents
being used and mostly C, A is still way
[SPEAKER_09]: more rare to even use.
[SPEAKER_09]: A third parent adds a lot more genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it sure does.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good direction and potential.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, you know, he's been talking about
during that interview, they're starting up
[SPEAKER_09]: the company again and they've got some
initial work coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that made me quite a bit more excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_09]: About anything that uses that plant
because the other thing, too, relative to
[SPEAKER_09]: that plant is I thought his talk about how
different skunk one was in the mid 80s
[SPEAKER_09]: when it first arrived than what it became
later on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people have considered that skunk
one has been this consistent thing and
[SPEAKER_09]: we're used to citrus or grapes or,
you know, maybe some cheese or funk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he said it was kind of rank when it
came over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that does, I wonder if that holds true
to stuff that Sam, Dave had said about
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding out skunk, breeding out the
actual skunk, skunky smells, I should say.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's not that many people we
can talk to that were growing skunk in
[SPEAKER_09]: 1985.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, the other interesting part about
that is that obviously that skunk haze
[SPEAKER_09]: that he talked about contains that raw,
more raw skunk one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in addition to a double and another
haze.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other side of it is this, you know,
maybe before it was hard selected in that
[SPEAKER_09]: direction that we're all so familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be like closer to something like
an Afghan haze that could be really rank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it was it was interesting tidbit
because you have so few people you can
[SPEAKER_09]: talk to about what was mid 80s skunk one
like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: He obviously bought it and bred it and
sold it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a big part of his catalog.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the years they were in operation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hearing his opinion about how mid and
late 80s skunk was vastly different than
[SPEAKER_09]: what came later was to me, at least
confirmation, you know, that that,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the state that things were in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was I was pretty cool when I
think we were talking about Friesland,
[SPEAKER_02]: Friesland, Indica, where he was very
honest and said he wasn't really stoked
[SPEAKER_02]: with where he's seen Friesland been taken
now as as it's been grown and bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And F Gen, like he wasn't really stoked
with the current offering of Friesland out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, I understand from his
perspective, like one thing, one thing
[SPEAKER_09]: that's certainly true is with Instagram
and other forms going on these days is
[SPEAKER_09]: that that's the way that a lot of people
interact with a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: They never get to try.
[SPEAKER_09]: So looks have become incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and, you know, so you you go to
the local books of some of those 80s and
[SPEAKER_09]: 90s strains are pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's some of them a little rough.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_09]: They might not be the most resonance.
[SPEAKER_09]: They might be kind of leafy.
[SPEAKER_09]: They might look kind of fugly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put that next to like, you know,
some kind of very modern, very gorgeous
[SPEAKER_09]: looking plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by looks alone, it kind of looks like
you're you know, you're drawn in squiggles
[SPEAKER_09]: or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Finger, you know, but but it also
reiterates that like you can you can't you
[SPEAKER_09]: can't look at effect with your eyes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it could be a super.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of haze out there that's
kind of ugly, but it works really good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a there's there's famous
haze in New York that gets sold brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in modern times, it's not very easy to
sell brown weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but that name tells it that name.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it also it tastes great and it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the smoke is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the fact that it I mean,
even so, you know, you know, we had this
[SPEAKER_09]: we had this cut that, you know,
my friend helped make that the the
[SPEAKER_09]: chocolate diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it and it was a combination of
chocolate tie cross to the 91 and then
[SPEAKER_09]: cross the sardines.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crazy, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he it was legitimate old like 80s
chocolate tie smoke then types.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And eventually it got lost because it was
super potent.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like top super tie, super chem.
[SPEAKER_09]: It knocked you on your ass, but it cured
brown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And people hated it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: For that look, that look even chem four
chem four can sometimes cure to like a
[SPEAKER_09]: very light brownish.
[SPEAKER_09]: It still looks the resin and all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the butt itself looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people don't like brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old clockwork orange mom was the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We called it orange not because of the
flavor, but it's more because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual color of the plant when it was
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was more of a golden orange
brown look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unique in that sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: But really, I mean, you know, you talked
his interview is not that much different
[SPEAKER_09]: than what a lot of us have who have bred
in various houses in various ways and
[SPEAKER_09]: tried to get away with it here and there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and they were just grabbing the
best stuff they could at the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them were straight strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them were bag seeds that they
found out a good weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And coffee shops is how a lot of breeding
in America happened to later on as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bag seed has ruled the game for,
you know, and and so it's cool that things
[SPEAKER_09]: are opening up and we can talk to people
like that who have such a vastly different
[SPEAKER_09]: experience of starting then.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, maybe we can get some more,
you know, if things open up a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: more in America and over there,
there could be some actual like more
[SPEAKER_09]: closer collaborations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because obviously there's been a lot of
illicit flow back and forth between the
[SPEAKER_09]: Dutch and America and Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would be neat to be able to one day
to actually do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we each have some pretty amazing
things and we have some different lines
[SPEAKER_09]: and we have some things that's segregated
from each other over time.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you talk about him being able to
go to Canada and there's there's some
[SPEAKER_09]: super sativa seed club stuff that still
exists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they might be able to get it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, that brings me to
another part, though, was when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to him and this might have been
actually a private conversation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was it was talking to him about the
people that have made whole companies off
[SPEAKER_02]: of selling illicit, not illicit,
but like unreal reproductions of super
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa seed club just to market on the
name and move seeds fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he was talking about resourcing
genetics, that's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an actual issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, so many people have made different
super sativa seed club repros,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's going to make sourcing a little
harder for some of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've talked about this on previous
podcasts in the sense that it's really
[SPEAKER_09]: only the last maybe five or six years that
there's been a massive resurgence and
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to find ancient and original beans.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a big era where everybody wanted
new new.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the old stuff was most of the stories
were pretty honest because nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, now that things have legalized and
things have opened up and lots of people
[SPEAKER_09]: have kind of the same things, there's been
this massive explosion of I found these
[SPEAKER_09]: seeds in my old connections dresser,
my grandma's freezer, my this,
[SPEAKER_09]: my that.
[SPEAKER_09]: These have been faithfully reproduced and
not just SSSE, but every legendary line
[SPEAKER_09]: you can think of.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's dates associated with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them are super early.
[SPEAKER_09]: Too early.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it makes it really hard to sift
through and find the real because there's
[SPEAKER_09]: there as people get more excited about
weed and people get more excited about the
[SPEAKER_09]: history and stuff, they're going to
they're going to want this like we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to want to try some old pure
lines.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would love to dig through
everything from the seed bank and SSSE now
[SPEAKER_09]: being my age and knowing what I know now,
it would be amazing to dig through all
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so and so people pray, you know,
it's kind of like the roadkill skunk thing
[SPEAKER_09]: where there's a there's a market demand
for certain things now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's a market demand for old.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully, some of his old stuff
legitimately did exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know I know a few reproductions are
out there that that are legitimate for
[SPEAKER_02]: some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just goes to to say that it's cool
that that people are are getting so into
[SPEAKER_02]: researching cannabis to the point of
really getting into provenance and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it combats that because if stuff like
that doesn't sell, if these if these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: who are doing these reproductions that
you're it's pretty obvious usually when
[SPEAKER_02]: these guys are working.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really obvious about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be obvious to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be less obvious to others
depending on, you know, how how in tune
[SPEAKER_09]: your scamdar is or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that for most people,
you know, there's a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be frank, like I went to a lot of
Amsterdam trips.
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought a lot of seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of it was not keepers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I did find some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly others found some elites that
have survived to this day off the same
[SPEAKER_09]: lines that I bought.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But even back then, it was a total crap
shoot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was there was a lot to not be
impressed by.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, him looking and being honest
and being like, oh, the Friesland,
[SPEAKER_09]: it wasn't it's not so nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But still, if it is real, the cool part
about it is, is that opening up the gene
[SPEAKER_09]: pool and adding genes that have been lost
over time and aren't being used,
[SPEAKER_09]: we have too much overuse.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Too few lines and cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of 80s and old things by
themselves might not be all that great,
[SPEAKER_09]: but they could widen the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you never know what they might pop and
out process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we, you know, we just,
you know, see us I who knows where the ABC
[SPEAKER_09]: work will go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_09]: As you start hybridizing it with things
and adding those genes in and making poly
[SPEAKER_09]: hybrids with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to me, some of the most if anything
from the 80s or early 90s survived,
[SPEAKER_09]: even if by itself, it's not that great.
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have traits or things that you
add into something really inbred.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get something surprising.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know how terpenes will modify
other terpenes or thiolic expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with new and novel expressions,
or maybe they weren't new and novel in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 80s, but they're back to being new and
novel now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that you never know how that'll change
and modify snow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, one of the things about
breeding is you tend to get good results
[SPEAKER_09]: when you cross things that are very
dissimilar to each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so taking something that hasn't been
really worked with much since the 80s or
[SPEAKER_09]: early 90s and isn't in a lot of this Kush
skittles, cookies, whatever blends of
[SPEAKER_09]: things, it might pop some new and cool
things in that regard.
[SPEAKER_09]: So all in all, I thought he was a wealth
of information.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Super engaging and pleasant.
[SPEAKER_09]: He seemed like an older version of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that made it really fun and relaxing to
chat with them about everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: He seems willing to maybe do some more.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm sure there's a lot of history
and experiences that he's seen that's
[SPEAKER_09]: right up our alley.
[SPEAKER_09]: So no promises, but we'll see what comes
of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in closing, I think we learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there was a lot of things that
weren't very well publicly known that he
[SPEAKER_09]: clarified.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so not only from a historical
perspective, but for the current,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was really a good interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was really, really stoked to be
able to speak with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those few times where it's
someone that you've always wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: interview and speak to, and they weren't a
complete disappointment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was absolutely an honor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope everybody enjoyed listening to
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's a little bit strange.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's two part and we'll see how things go.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we hope to be able to bring you some
more of some of the pioneers and cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: and their view on things and how we got to
where we are.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, thanks and peace,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
