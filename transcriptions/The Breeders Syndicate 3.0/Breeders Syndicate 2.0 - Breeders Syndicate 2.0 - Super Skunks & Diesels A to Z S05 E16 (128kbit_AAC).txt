[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dog, Breeder and Grower from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, I think this is working.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're live, so I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think we're good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can rock it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tonight we're going to do the diesels A
to Z.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we've covered it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes ad nauseam, we cover super skunk
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I think this is going to be a
good way to do it with our new platform
[SPEAKER_04]: being able to illustrate with pictures and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to be able to do kind of like
a documentary style thing with pretty much
[SPEAKER_04]: not so narrating as we go along and
covering what we can of the diesel story,
[SPEAKER_04]: which means we're not going to touch as
much on the.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you lost the not so, which means we're
not going to touch on as much of the chem
[SPEAKER_04]: story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I still here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this still live, everyone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, just making sure I have no idea what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was my fat thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, we'll put that up to a fat
thumb mistake where I hit the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: button.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, see, we're live again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you guys know we're live this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we wanted to cover it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to jump as much into the
chems because we've covered a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: chems, but we do want to do a serious
diesel presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So without much further ado, where do you
want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're going to rehash this,
obviously, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's and maybe we decided that since
it's the Thanksgiving holiday that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could pick a subject that everybody likes
to argue about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it's one of those ones
where, you know, whenever you talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, some people are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are are think you're wrong on
some parts of it and some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: offended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever we do this, every there is
definitely going to be people offended.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's just as like a
disclaimer, this is like everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're saying is like the best as we know
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, new information pops up at
different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's good, sometimes not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's it's, you know,
it's all wrapped up in one of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: where it became one of the most famous
strains in America for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so how it originated gets battled
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it happened in the 90s,
when there was a lot of secrecy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it took relatively speaking a long time
for the story to come out and for which
[SPEAKER_00]: people involved decided to speak when.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a lot of claimants to the
throne of diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no shortage to that, that's for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And which cut is the original?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so from like so there's
different perspectives on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, any time one of the ways
that people get rep in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community or whatever is having some kind
of tie or even responsibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps for like a famous cut or a famous
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the best ways to get like Kana
longevity and fame, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best way to start a seed company,
to kick off the seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're offering a clone that
like other people don't have very much.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so there's that aspect of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's also the aspect is like
sour and diesels became popular in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-marketing era of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of became organically popular
and then the more popular they became,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more people hunted them out to like,
you know, to find more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the more got grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it sort of became a
self-fulfilling prophecy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where eventually sour became popular
enough that like literally, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people talked about diesel as gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gas operated like a whole section of
the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, every day I get emails asking,
what do you got that's gas?
[SPEAKER_04]: I need the gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, almost more than anything,
people still demand gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think it's I think it's a
number of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can you can hit sour from all these
different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Matt said, you know, we'll
eventually get to the point where we start
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting about like specific cuts and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like maybe even like a more general
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, diesel and it's beginning
and this is some confusion out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but diesel was slang for good weed in New
York in that era.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so just so people know, there wasn't
like a specific cut or a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: something that came out where before that
name had never been associated with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what happens a lot of times
with famous strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is they is so, you know,
so diesel came out and diesel was just
[SPEAKER_00]: slang for good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sour diesel came out and,
you know, these diesel cuts and it became
[SPEAKER_00]: so famous that it pretty much swamped
anything that had been called diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there was there's other
things out there that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that people called diesel back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it eventually got swamped by this one
family.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, do you want to start about talk about
what the original thoughts were that the
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel was?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I remember when we first got on
the forums, it was a lot of people were
[SPEAKER_04]: saying it was just, you know, bag seed and
that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, well, that's pretty much held
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that I don't think is held up
just because now we've gotten the chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to look through a whole bunch of Chem 91
S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so it's definitely got other
influences to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think it's true that it was it
was some bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just there's a little bit more to the
story than that, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the confusion comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems relatively safe to say that
it's some combination of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: chem and, you know, chem and skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're your old favorite, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an old high times photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume it was taken of maybe from G's,
you know, place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not a hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I assume so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I mean, it's not the
most photogenic plant ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a lot of traits that are very
distinctive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've talked about it before,
the leaf cannibalism trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not everyone's favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make for great finish,
but either.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have a few more good shots of 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to mostly give people an idea of.
[SPEAKER_04]: How it will breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at the traits of the dog,
here's some more.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy Nitz, we're all we're seeing is
seven seven thumbnails right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're not actually giving us very
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so it's not sharing it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to get good at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Share screen window.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Share.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Jimmy Nitz, pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking at some of the traits of
the dog here, and you will see some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these pass on to what we see later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go back a second, that pic right
there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with what the leaf does,
you know, I can see that in Sauer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can see it in Sauer's progeny,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and people if people want to
take note, you can kind of take note of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the dark leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the structure, it's obviously
not exact by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog is much more kind of a stouter Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit leggy, but nothing like
the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think some of that bud structure and
some of those dark leaves and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way the leaves yellow and brown is pretty
characteristic of the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's an old chem dog picture from
high times as well in the upper right
[SPEAKER_04]: corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a different way of growing it,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, she certainly comes out in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just so people know, what's
generally agreed upon is that Sauer is
[SPEAKER_00]: some combination of Chem 91 and skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to illustrate that, I will bring this
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where the some of the
some of the guff comes in, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of like what people say it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a there's a Polaroid from Skunk VA
about some of the old super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think you can see sour diesel
traits in in that pic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so to me, it's basically a chem
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a lot of chem skunk hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's exactly that nothing
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could even have a couple of herms in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, the general story is that
these guys got, you know, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some they were getting some some
supposed chem dog, either that or a hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: from this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they collected those seeds and they
popped them in the summer of 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got a couple cuts that they kept
and they called them diesel one and diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then they gave some weed of
that marked our diesel to their homie,
[SPEAKER_00]: who grew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found some seed and he thought that
the our diesel had an S in front of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he thought it was called sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the mom of sour diesel because
we know the bud that the the weed came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that we know the weed that the
seeds came out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the mom for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this it was this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also just so people know,
because it started another legend,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mom of it, they called diesel two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people called it headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because there was this mystery of
what the New York headband actually was,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a whole field of headband cuts
that claim to be that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first original, you know, New York
City headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some really early picks,
ones from high times, ones from Canna
[SPEAKER_04]: Bible of different sour diesel cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the bottom right corner here,
you should you could probably be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: see the headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: As it was stated in the Canna Bible,
which, yeah, so there's not there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a few there's a few O
.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that got their name changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the headband, which added to
the confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, then there's names bandied about
like Dayrecker, which matters more.
[SPEAKER_04]: This headband looks pretty cushy in this
picture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so it added to a bunch of
confusion because outside of a really
[SPEAKER_00]: small circle, there wasn't really any
confirmation on exactly what the famous
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City headband was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor did people know that it was mom of
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a tidbit that came out pretty
much in recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, like Matt
knows a little bit better than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the forums, wasn't it like
there was a bunch of stuff like it came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the R.H., the RFK skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was DHL in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all these theories bandied about
about a much more complicated lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hawaiian RFK skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the the theory JJ put forward for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a decent theory.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't think it turned panned
out very well because our state RFK skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: was being passed around at the time is in
the same kind of room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the same crews were growing
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was it was it was a decent theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I also think, too,
that like much more so than theories,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like you have different people that
are that are involved in the scene or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that come along and they tell
their version of it and other people are
[SPEAKER_00]: staying quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for you know, for a lot of times
and a lot of cannabis stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that come out first with the
first story get get the most rep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why that O.G.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush story about the lemon Pakistani and
all that still is passed down this day
[SPEAKER_04]: like like biblical, because people really
think that's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, regardless of all that,
before we get into like a discussion about
[SPEAKER_00]: like the various the various versions of
it, sort of what happened, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that, you know, the East Coast is a is
a big consumer area and they loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a really good zippy up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got people super baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a pungent and very distinctive
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think the nose lasted for a
while and didn't fade very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, when people were bringing it
different places like that, that
[SPEAKER_00]: persisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just became something that
people knew when they bought was
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so completely separate from the
lineage, the vast majority of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: grew ever grew sour diesel knew almost
nothing of what we just talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got this cut as sour diesel or sour
or whatever, and people would buy it for
[SPEAKER_00]: for a good month for a good chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they like to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all kinds of people started
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on the West Coast and Mendo and
Humboldt, it was a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it was it was like
growing modern skunkweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the easiest outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did great in depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was kind of funny inside,
depending.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was temperature dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times people, you know,
it should go probably like 10 or 11,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 weeks, maybe even 13, depending on the
Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people will take it would take it
back in the day as soon as they could get
[SPEAKER_00]: away with getting the nose on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of sour that was that
was harvested between 60 and 65 days that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably should have gone 70 or 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In all honesty, is this the the one that I
have up here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you familiar with this one?
[SPEAKER_04]: The super leafy looking one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's the way it was
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't I don't remember where he took
that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't really say I've seen people put
up pictures of a plant that looks very
[SPEAKER_04]: similar to this one saying, yeah,
I got the original diesel one from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Canna Bible, but I just never really been
able to confirm it just because it looks
[SPEAKER_04]: so different than any of the ways I've
seen diesel grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like the thing about the
the thing about the bag seed beginning is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it which I don't know which way is
the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like that multiple people got
multiple bag seeds even early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was probably, you know,
at least there was a couple things that
[SPEAKER_00]: were diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a thing that was headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a couple sours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even the people that tell the
story say the guy that found sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had a couple of Finos, but only one got
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I also real quick for anybody
listening to the audio version of this
[SPEAKER_04]: after we upload it later, I highly
recommend watching the episode because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot more to it with visual aids
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely if you listen to it,
go back and rewatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got it got really popular in the
sense that it was it's what in my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of the best families of cannabis
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really nice high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not overly dense, which is good in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to taking bong hits or
smoking a joint or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I think burn ability is like an
overlooked component.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even even break up ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's it's really obnoxious to have to
try to break up these big ass,
[SPEAKER_04]: dense nugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't break up that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this might be dumb or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like one of the things that I like to
breed for is like, you know, weed is
[SPEAKER_00]: convenient when it's like in the dark at a
concert and you can break off a chunk with
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand and stuff it into a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a little bit of what you need
to do and you can then smoke it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it also makes this thing where
there's a certain amount when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: burning stuff, there's a certain amount of
like air to air to material ratio that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps it burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that makes you get a good a good
hit or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think diesels burned really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were like a pretty effective
delivery device as far as getting buzzed.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think the Grateful Dead came
into play with the popularity of diesel?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's that comes into play really
early on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you know, for one thing,
if we're correct in that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog is the beginning of it or
whatever that like, you know, the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that came that became chem dog were
acquired at a dead show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was bag seed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I do think in terms of like
the 90s, especially, it's not so much like
[SPEAKER_00]: this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the 90s, Grateful Dead
hippies were sort of the highway epicenter
[SPEAKER_00]: of the American weed market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's there's a lot of different
groups that grow now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying obviously they were the
only people, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sort of started being regularly
spread about through dead shows and
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of them growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, like,
you know, the the people sour diesel came
[SPEAKER_00]: from were essentially hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to go see the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to go see fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the kids that like to go party
and have a good time and see some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brought together people from
disparate parts of America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that mixed strains and that
mixed seeds and people brought those
[SPEAKER_00]: things home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they brought it from California
to wherever it went to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moved around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it definitely did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think at the time probably
like the Grateful Dead was like sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like America's last nomadic tribe of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an interesting way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were they were kind of like
the Roma, you know, they were kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsies in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, three quarters of the year
they tripped around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they and they had to figure out a way
to survive going from town to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways they survived was by
hustling weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so it was found at a dead
show and then it like and then they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it and selling it to other
hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it it hermed and then it hermed
again and and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's true anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tour like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, growing cannabis
especially has gone into all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: walks of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so but for a minute there,
it was kind of like it was spread around
[SPEAKER_00]: by a lot of people that were like that or
connected to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So which one did you want to cover next?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which direction did you want to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, really, what we could do is I think
let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was two different things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a scene in New York that was
kind of small and indoor based where
[SPEAKER_00]: people were getting crazy digits for sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like AJ and Manny various,
various different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it made its way west because it
was easier because with 215 in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and other places, it was easier to grow
more of it in the west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was still it was still supplying
that initial demand back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for a while it was just sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no other name or qualifier
given.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say maybe and you can correct
me if you think I'm wrong, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the forums is where these all these
other names started to percolate around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from, like, let's say the mid 90s when
it came out to, like, the early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_00]: was there names or was it all just sour
diesel?
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's prior to my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was all just I think,
you know, I mean, I got my cut and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: helpfully it was helpfully called sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and then as the forums
happened, that's the beginning of,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, people needing to identify,
like, where strains come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you get, like, stuff like,
oh, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Chaco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the East.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the this is the Shroomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the other early names of
sour Amish was one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was one of the Shroomy other
names for Shroomy because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: because because because Shroomy was
supposedly from Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was sometimes called his name or
Amish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called it Cobb sometimes because Cobb
did amazing grows of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people would ask me, I'd be like,
look at Chaco's.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a great grow of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Chaco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, yeah, why did you know,
there's a lot of people that call the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: the skunk V.A cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was online talking about it and
they were trying to figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: label the specific thing he was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, oh, it's so it's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the same thing happened with sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's funny about that is that sour
diesel goes through phases where if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good sour, nobody gives a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes through a phase where
lineage is important and people try to
[SPEAKER_00]: track down lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes through a phase where
it's not important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's good sour, it's good sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're in a phase again where
lineage is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being the first one is important and
having the real deal is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's probably like 15 or 20
different sour diesel names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even more so now in the past three
years, I'd say many more popped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so we've got like just the ones I
think off off my head that people talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, like East Coast Sour Diesel,
New York City Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amish Chaco.
[SPEAKER_00]: E.C.S.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: E.C.S.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: The D.H.K.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut was one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Devil's Harvest Group Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: D.H.K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also the Dark Heart Nursery Cut,
the D.H.N.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm still going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he should out or I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know if you all see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how far Matt got.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the Dark Heart Nursery Cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had the D.H.N., the D.H.K.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a little later came the Rez Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because Chem Dog gave Rez a cut
of Sour Diesel and he started making seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was probably a number of cuts
that came from Rez Seeds that got
[SPEAKER_00]: repurposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody just wanted to call like
to the brokers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really want to explain its
origin.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got super confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost a little bit like what
happened with Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where like in New York, there's like,
you know, in Florida, there's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 15 different, 20 different Hayes
names that only a tiny percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: people really know where they originated
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's things that are called,
you know, that are named that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In recent ones, it's like, you know,
now there's like there's a JP cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a skunk debt cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people attach my name to a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an A cut, the Hunter Mountain cut,
the Catskills cut, one helpfully called
[SPEAKER_00]: the real Sour Diesel as if that clears it
all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Manny cut, the AJ cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left out AJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ's had his name attached probably first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there was, you know,
the AJ cut and the AJ cut has probably had
[SPEAKER_00]: like several cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have been called the AJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like Ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that like what's the original AJ isn't
the current AJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The original ghost isn't even the same
ghost from the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking weird how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, well, it is weird how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we're talking about something
that was sprouted in 96 and it's 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's gone through like 26 years of
clandestine shifting around.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also was one of the most popular
cuts in America for probably 10 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it goes through phases,
you know, like it's been the most popular
[SPEAKER_04]: cut in America a few times for long spans
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I think the only reason
why I said for 10 years is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: because it probably took until about 2005,
2006 for enough people to get a hold of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, that there was just so much of it that
it could become probably like the most
[SPEAKER_00]: popular kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even though it was popular before,
it's like, you can only get so popular if
[SPEAKER_00]: only so many people are growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did take some time to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it remained popular right up
until probably like this last wave of
[SPEAKER_00]: candy, kitty purple weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took over and everything had to be,
you know, candy named and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of gelato or cookie hybrid of
some kite, some, it had to have a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: look.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of variations on the
theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time in about 20 years,
kind of gas fell off for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started hearing if it's not purple,
it won't move.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You stopped seeing a lot of the sour
beginnings of the names and stuff added to
[SPEAKER_04]: different strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, and what's funny about that is
then sour had like a moment for two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four years where it wasn't very
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's had a resurgence.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really weird because then you
have a situation now where there's like 15
[SPEAKER_00]: or 18 different names and everyone has
the, everyone has the special,
[SPEAKER_00]: rarest, oldest, bestest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strongest, mostest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bestest, the grandma's, all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it, you know, and there's a lot of
certainty in an uncertain world in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, most of them are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in all honesty, it's like,
there's, there's only, there's only really
[SPEAKER_00]: been one that I thought sucked terribly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the Joe B diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the Kim 91 JB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, the, I don't know what I,
you know, there's a thing I've told this
[SPEAKER_00]: story before, but there's a thing where I
just had this one sour diesel cut for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and I never traded with anyone
because I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people started asking me which
version I had, and I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have no idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So occasionally I collect half a dozen of
them or so, and I grow them all next to
[SPEAKER_00]: mine in the same room at the same time in
the same environment to see like which,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, what are the differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, there's, there's a good
amount of cuts out there and their origins
[SPEAKER_00]: are mysterious, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what mine is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still, I kept, at first I was like,
Oh, I'm just going to get this half a
[SPEAKER_00]: dozen or whatever, and I'm going to grow
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whatever one mine is,
that's then that's what everyone calls it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put up a picture just so
people could see what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, where's the sours?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be in this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And is it here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to, is it, is it up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it show up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so people know, I think Matt can
see comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The format I've got right now,
it's like hard for me to read at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if I'm missing stuff or if
you see anything super pertinent,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, just speak up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just a black screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably like four weeks in,
uh, there's a nug of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's so much like Chocos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it is like, at least this,
this, this is particular, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, we got that cut around 2000 and
we've never lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I consider sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if you, if you pause it for a
second, you know, when people were,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we, when you showed those pictures
of, uh, the dog, uh, the chem dog earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had you pause at that other one
where you could see like the leaf rust and
[SPEAKER_00]: death and the weird necrosis and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at that sour diesel right
there, you can see that same kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very first sour I got, there's a
lot of people that have sours that
[SPEAKER_00]: barricade mine doesn't barricade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you, whatever, whatever technical
term you'd call that it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's not really like somebody
messing up on the nutrient or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does the thing where it starts to eat
its leaves about halfway through
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a whole hell of a lot you
can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sometimes it's more pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then others, but it almost always happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one right there, it never
barricades ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just does that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was going to show this real
quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a pandas cut that keeps being
passed around his mass super of the diesel
[SPEAKER_04]: sour dub.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also has that same trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very similar trait in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, but then like my LA cut my
headband, um, you know, and then other
[SPEAKER_00]: sours I see people have have like more of
that chem D patterning variegation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't do the leaf rust,
leaf death, necrosis type yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a, it has its own distinct thing
that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm not saying mine's the
first, like, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what mine is before I got it,
but I can say I've had it, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: since then and not lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it throws bats and you know,
more importantly than that, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got, like just because it's the first
one, it's got what I consider to have like
[SPEAKER_00]: the distinct sour notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and can we talk about that a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like, that's something that a lot
of people, even to this day, like I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: hear, Oh, it's got the sour nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's sour, like, like lemons,
you know, I get that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's sour, like, you know,
uh, like sour, you know, but when I think
[SPEAKER_04]: of sour, I think burnt rubber skunky,
you know, what's sour to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, what I will say is like the diesel
family, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that particular one, uh, it smells,
it has, I would say it has gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the gas is almost on the backend,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where a lot of diesels it's, it's on the
forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the fumes of the first thing
that hits your nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that one has gas, but it also has this
weird nose crinkle, uh, in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sometimes you smell things that
like should be gross, but it's weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it smells delicious somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got kind of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like a nose crinkle gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's my perception of it at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it tastes really, it, the,
the, the flavor carries over pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big, big trade of sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor itself of what you get on the
nose is what you get on the palette,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I think, uh, a lot of, um,
a lot of the more modern stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as diesels and sours go,
which I still love a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fuel nose, the gas nose is like
very prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the, it's like on the forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that right there, um, the, although I
didn't tell you that, Matt, when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: setting some of these up, but all those
East coast sour diesel picks that I sent
[SPEAKER_00]: you right here, these are all from the
homie Pip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're, I mean, he didn't grow it,
but he, he's who gave me that version of
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I ran this one next to the Chaco
and they're identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you see that one, hold on,
go back one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see that one there, it's got a,
to me, like that's a nice Cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very delicate feathery,
you know, skunk kind of like overlaying
[SPEAKER_00]: calyxes kind of approach, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of Fox tailing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where like if, if that, the,
the actual sour that I have was much more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was very chunky, but it was,
it was very chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more side buds to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That East coast sour diesel would throw
bats, but they were delicate feathery
[SPEAKER_00]: looser bats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say something real quick for
people who don't aren't familiar with
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and that's kind of like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so when you're looking at plants,
it's, they look very different indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: To greenhouse to outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're looking at this and thinking,
ah, that doesn't look anything like my
[SPEAKER_04]: East coast, our diesel or my ECSD cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it's going to have to do with the
morphology from it going to indoor to
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor greenhouse and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make that clear for
people because a lot of people try to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, make those associations by
looking at pictures of cuts and saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: eh, this is, this is the same cut,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a major jump going outdoor to,
to indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we could segue into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For just a second, which is there are some
strains that are very easy to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: visually because they tend to perform in
different environments, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, outdoor greenhouse, they tend to
perform similarly enough that they're easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diesel family in general is not that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it can come out very different,
even in people's indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very sensitive to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very sensitive to food and,
and whether it's organic or salts or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so to me, the only real way to
test diesel really well is to grow it side
[SPEAKER_00]: by side to itself in the same environment
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't see it in this greenhouse
right yet, but in that greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had about seven types of diesels all
growing next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same food, same size pots, same light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it was the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the same thing inside,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, that's really where you get to
see the nuances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I am not good at, and I don't think
anyone is really that good at looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: diesels or certain strains like that
online and being like, looking at this
[SPEAKER_00]: pick and being like, oh yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's being grown K and F and under an
led in somebody's environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not yours and you don't grow it
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, you know, I, I really do
believe that you kind of have to like
[SPEAKER_00]: compare same to same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this right here, I was, I didn't load
up a picture of indoor sour for whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: reason, the ECSD, but I did keep a picture
of super skunk candy, which has a very
[SPEAKER_04]: similar, uh, morphology bud structure to
what sour looks indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to the ECSD cuts
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll say, you know, I'll say that
when I grow diesel, I see south,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see super skunk and I see chem dog in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't guarantee it's the only thing in
it, but I, I see traits that pass down
[SPEAKER_00]: from both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown a lot of all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it, uh, take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that like sour for
everyone listening, diesels in general is
[SPEAKER_00]: our modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I, I agree that sour,
you know, I think that fuel and gas and
[SPEAKER_00]: that nose crinkle and all that weird,
I, I think that's all offshoots of like
[SPEAKER_00]: that rank RFK, like all that skunk stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just all plays on the same
nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put up pictures of chem 91 again,
so people can get into the right idea for,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the look at super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go, go back to one more,
that one, you can see it on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had another one in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Oh, one more back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see when I was showing my picture
of sour diesel and he was showing that
[SPEAKER_00]: sour dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, uh, so that's three different cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that same weird leaf curl,
Browning leaf death, the whole bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a trait that passes in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another trait that I see in super
skunk a lot, and I only ever see it in
[SPEAKER_04]: super skunk are these little, what we call
them dog tongues, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're little, slightly rounded,
not very resonance leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all over the, the buds and
little tiny small parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually, uh, any super skunk types,
whether it be chem 91, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, any of them sour, usually you'll see
those little things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, it's, it's a trait that runs
through super skunk and it's usually easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to tell super skunk because of that trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those identifying visual
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, I guess there's,
um, so there's probably like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there was the first wave of sour that
got passed around a bunch and those were
[SPEAKER_00]: just labeled sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had basically no other monikers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was probably something
from, I don't know, would you say like the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid two thousands on where there was a
whole batch that started getting named on
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it fell out of popularity for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's another whole batch that
has gotten named on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's like, I know, you know,
Jay plant speaker has asked people not to,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to name it after him because it's not
his, but what happens is, is you tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: name it by the source that other people
would know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some kind of descriptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ends up being not so sour or JP sour
or skunk tech sour or this sour or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, or, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, and I don't know
that, you know, I would have to go get
[SPEAKER_00]: probably gather up another half a dozen
sours and grow them against the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at one point I think I had like nine
or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't keep all of them, but I was
trying to collect them to see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell was going on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause for a long time I thought there was
just a couple of cuts and then I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a ton.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: My headphone broke real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your headphone broke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to switch headphones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, uh, I, um, people are talking
in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at, you know,
the, uh, uh, the thing about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone just asked something and I wish I
had crybaby on right now to explain it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but somebody was asking what are the main
terpenes of, of sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that terpenes,
uh, tell the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's these volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I don't, I don't, uh, mangle the
word, but he would call the alls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I all styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a number of different
scent compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sour diesel and skunks in
general have a relatively complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: chain of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a combination of terpenes and you
know, uh, volatile gases and other types
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that combine to make that aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, so far, uh, uh, something
sulfur compounds, uh, uh, it's on tip my
[SPEAKER_04]: tongue, volatile sulfur compounds,
BSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, because you know, the,
even with like the super skunk that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got posted up there right now,
um, it smelled unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two weeks of flower and the first
three or four weeks of, uh, post-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it faded and it didn't store that
well and it became kind of generic green
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those terpenes were not long lasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not the kind of weed,
the super skunk itself that you would want
[SPEAKER_00]: to store and let chill for a month for
best effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the kind of weed where like as
soon as it was smokable, you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: start ripping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was going to fade where the
chem dog was the reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took almost a month for it to really
come into its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the sour is a blend of the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also holds it for a while,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, it holds it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the super skunks do not hold that
skunkiness super well past drying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't last long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super skunk is best fresh and becomes
generic pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hardest part about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't store well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it doesn't, it, it does not
store well.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I wonder if that, you know,
like we always hear about people like
[SPEAKER_04]: stopping growing skunky stuff because like
they didn't want to get popped or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that another aspect would have
been not starring well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that is a major important part of,
you know, artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't store that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it was only moderate potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the other component.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a classic example of a strain that
does a couple of things really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but isn't, is incomplete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was the whole point of the,
of the super dog project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really was to sort of take the lime green
color from the super skunk and its flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of its visible crystal formation.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And add that to the frame of the chem dog,
which was denser and much more potent and
[SPEAKER_00]: longer lasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were trying to see, can we get,
can we get the good parts of both into
[SPEAKER_00]: each?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, this what's weird though is
that if you made, if you made dry sift,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, not water hash, but if you made dry,
I actually think some of the stuff was
[SPEAKER_00]: water soluble, but if you made dry sift
with the super skunk and you jarred that
[SPEAKER_00]: and treated it nice, the, the pro the
smell profile would stay for a long,
[SPEAKER_00]: long time in Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in weed, it would oxidize and go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, for all of the legendary,
legendary shit people talk about super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk, like six weeks after you cut it
down, that shit was generic green weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get you that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that as like a big fan of it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it wasn't something that like,
you were like, oh, you know, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: two months from now, this is going to be
the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you fucking ripped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it was dry enough to smoke,
you started puffing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would almost, you would almost
ruin the dog if you smoked it too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really benefited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was denser and it took longer to cure
its flavor and its buzz really benefited
[SPEAKER_00]: by you kind of leaving it alone for a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they bonded well together because you
could smoke the shit out of super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few weeks and then finally start
hitting your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there would be a time period
where both were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, the super skunk would be
bunk and the, and the dog would still be
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd harvest again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there essentially might've been two
different types of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just because they were two different
expressions, you could bounce between
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just, I, and it's, what's
interesting too, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we joke around about how like,
um, you know, the most famous thing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Sam skunk man ever did was breed the
skunk out of, uh, out of, out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his point of view was that the skunky
shit didn't have the high he liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he bred away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a muddled, not that great a high
and the stuff that we all don't like as
[SPEAKER_00]: much like the, the citrus and the floral
and all that, that had the more up buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: that he enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll believe it when he comes on the show
and tells it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't really believe that
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to hear it from him personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, uh, that's the thing about all
the old timers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that there's like very little,
there's, it's, it's all their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their remembrances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there is someone though that
grew, um, a lot of night or a lot of skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: one from, uh, Robin Sam in 1978,
three are going to be interviewing soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, he actually has a, he has the
documentation, all of the pictures we can
[SPEAKER_04]: imagine was even in high times selling,
you know, in the THMQ showing that he was
[SPEAKER_04]: growing it, selling it, it was moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, he has very good memories of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, very accurate and he's, he's really
quick with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He might actually prove me wrong.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that would be dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the more, the more opinions you get to
it, I mean, that's kind of the getting
[SPEAKER_00]: back to sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's kind of the crux of like people
having one sour story is there's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: like half a dozen people loosely
associated with the creation of sour in
[SPEAKER_00]: one form or another, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two or three that are pretty central
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all don't agree on exactly how it
all went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even amongst themselves and publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a certain point it's like,
who do you trust?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you talk to?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard, especially because a lot of
times, you know, and Matt and I deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but a lot of times when you interview
people, their first goal isn't historical
[SPEAKER_00]: honesty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making themselves look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of part of being
human.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telling, telling the history in a way that
suits them, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more angles you can get on the same
subject at times, uh, it can be better,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is, um, this is a picture from
rascal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I chose this picture was
because back in the day, it was so hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: find any good pictures of diesel,
but also realistic pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there were a lot of people growing
stuff that wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_04]: His showed the, it's in my opinion,
how it looks the best low resolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, his, it wasn't as Fox daily,
but I mean, it gets pretty heavily Fox
[SPEAKER_04]: tailed and looks a lot like super skunk in
that old sensei picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for people to be able to, to see what
diesel is, it was again, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is a, uh, uh, super stunk S one,
not a super skunk chem dog D hybrid,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the Kenna Bible said, but you see all
these wonderful expressions of super
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk, even a little dog tongues in the,
in the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping that some of this genetic
testing that came out was going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: revealing some of these connections and
lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we would have, uh, data sets to go
with the oral histories and the stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far that's been elusive and hasn't
really happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we're stuck with the stories,
but I will say that, um, this is just one
[SPEAKER_00]: guy's opinion, but, uh, diesel is probably
up there with like my all time favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: family of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's up there to me with haze or
something along those lines in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's definitely like, you know,
take it to the Island type of bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and most of them are pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew when I realized that there was a
bunch of sours out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took my sour, the ECSD from PIP,
uh, and NYC diesel, uh, the Joe B the
[SPEAKER_04]: Amish clarify the NYC diesel, clarify that
for people, clarify the NYC diesel for
[SPEAKER_04]: people that it was not the Soma one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not the Soma one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't even related.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from no, it was from Baldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from bald eagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, and then I got a couple
others and I grew them all side by side
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors and in a greenhouse, uh,
two or three times in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting because they,
when you're growing like the same family
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, and you're seeing sisters to
each other or half says whatever they
[SPEAKER_00]: might be related to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely all from the same
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them had dark, had very dark
green leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them had very light green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, yeah, the, some of them smelled
like the, the Chaco, uh, I grew the Chaco
[SPEAKER_00]: and the East coast sour diesel from PIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were basically, I think the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they have like, to me,
what I consider to be more like an LA or
[SPEAKER_00]: like a headband smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the New York city diesel from,
uh, bald eagle was like pure fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like dipped in gasoline and then you
smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other notes of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, like pure nose, crinkling fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them had skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them had a mix of skunk and
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Amish was pretty nice, but compared
out of all of them, out of all that first
[SPEAKER_00]: batch, I think the, the ECSD that PIP gave
that supposedly half of death star,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that particular cut that the Chaco or
whatever was my favorite of the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than the East coast,
sour diesel and the Chaco, none of them
[SPEAKER_00]: were the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I grew them again, I think the
second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that year, remember it was the second
can Illuminati party we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought four or five different types
of those that year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the Amish real well,
cause that was my favorite for flavor
[SPEAKER_04]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually that year I didn't actually bring
any of my own sour for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it didn't end up in the, it didn't
end up in the comparison, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I was growing all the newer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeing how they performed and some of
them were shorter and fatter and yielded,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a little nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were taller and more
feathery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and their formation and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but they were all variations on
the same theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were all they, you know,
but I did find it interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, my headband has kind of my LA
has kind of lighter leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NYCD from bald eagle and another one,
both had very pale leaves like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there was a couple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like all these different expressions
of similar stuff coming out of the same
[SPEAKER_04]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was one that, but then
there was another one that, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mine and the dog and one other diesel
had very dark, dark, dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like olive colored, not lime at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them stayed pure green all the
way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them variegated and some of them
did that weird leaf death thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those different traits from,
uh, you know, super scones, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that was interesting too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people get all uptight about like
everyone's everyone's sour now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it goes back to the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the this people are attaching their
name to it and trying to sell them for
[SPEAKER_00]: high dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the good thing for me at least is
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite all that chaos, um, it's better
weed generally than what's been popular
[SPEAKER_00]: lately.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only an improvement, you know,
over all these other purples and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that have been running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'm against purple by any means,
but just like the, the purple only era,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's is, uh, Choco is not chocolate
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just commented.
[SPEAKER_00]: That chocolate diesel is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choco is a dude from the forums that got a
cut of sour diesel named after of him
[SPEAKER_00]: because of how he traded it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that accurate?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got named after him because it was the
one I kept referring people to go look to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was my dumb ass added another name to
sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, so yeah, he got,
he was a guy on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, um, you know, he ended up
getting a cut of sour diesel named after
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the, it's kind of the movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw someone said that Amish is a cross
of sour and headbanger that, that come on
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of different stories
about these different ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one headbangers like five years old
Amish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will, I will all agree with Matt on
there a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name Amish from Shroomy far,
far precedes any headbanger existence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little bit off on the ears,
which is why I was giggling, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, yeah, they, they, uh,
there's a, there's a whole bit of it where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's cool that there's all this like
renewed interest in trying to figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and one of the things that's made
diesel cuts a lot more popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I think, uh, is because they,
because that strain became so popular for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like the NL five hazes where
there's just more phenos of it than almost
[SPEAKER_00]: any other type out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not like, I mean, I think,
you know, gelato and cookie has a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos obviously.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sour and sour is up there is like,
there's a bunch of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it's pretty widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have access to it, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps something gain popularity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people want to figure out,
Oh, well, which one is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody wants the original real
one, just in the sense that they think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that one has to be better than all
the ones that came after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, it's the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it starts out the best and it just
loses as it goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that how breeding works?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, you know, sometimes, but
sometimes things get better too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so I just wanted to,
this is another super skunk cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my blooper skunk, which is the
diesel blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just wanted to show this because you
can see a lot of the sour traits coming
[SPEAKER_04]: through very heavy in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very obviously it breeds very dominant or
the super skunk traits, I should say,
[SPEAKER_04]: which you can see in sour and all the
other super skunk types.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go down grandchildren,
great grandchildren when it comes to super
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if someone's selecting towards those
traits, you will still be seeing those
[SPEAKER_04]: traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And often you'll be seeing those same
scent profiles and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We somebody was asking which there's some
spammers in our comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone was asking which one has the dark
one, the dark leaves, the cut that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: has dark leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's depends on how much you feed it
nitrogen to it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can that can be, like I said,
before visually, they can be very hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell apart in different people's rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they are very
environmentally and spectrum sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they perform very differently depending
on where they're at and how they're fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when, you know, when Pip was at that
party and he smoked that ECSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was like, dude, that's some of the best
I've ever seen it grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't so much a testament to me
knocking it out of the park or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a testament to like sours can
be really hard to nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they can.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make our super boofy super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you grow sour and you knock it
out of the park and you're so stoked in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next three or four times you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not nearly as good, but you didn't
change much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you really knock it out of the
park and you get its full potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: its full buzz, its full nose, everything,
you're just like, oh, my God, that's some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best weed on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when you miss, it's still usually
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know that there was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially you've already had better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know that, you know,
that there was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get into the L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to show off some of the headband
L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: is I told that story before as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just so people know, the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: is the first headband that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it about a year after the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got it in 2001 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had it since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's we used to get sold to Sauer all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, that's what Matt's
throwing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same greenhouse that that East
Coast Sauer Diesel was in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that that thing throws
straight bats compared to the ECSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the Malawi or a Durbin in the
back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some sativas in the back over
there, some headstache along the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Panama, I think, on the far
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Panama from CSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: The old Canna Biogen Charlize,
Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's there's some on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those years, whenever I can, I like to
throw experimental stuff out there and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like putting plants in the sun if they
if you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's the lean loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it mixed in with other things more
than just straight, pure, astringent
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially if it comes with a buzz
that I like, I can handle it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that's most things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's my that's my headband
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know any inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very it's very sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very diesel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little different in terms of its
buzz, but it's obviously you can just look
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's from the same family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bigger yielding, especially in the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's it's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of times, a lot of people can't
tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a lot of our.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell the difference between this
and what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like it's like to them, it's like,
in fact, there was a bunch of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: would just call it sour and then they
would come up looking for that sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mostly because of the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it has a really great buzz and
has a really great nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a long time, when it came to
diesel family, I had that cut and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: that sour diesel cut that you showed way
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was super happy with those two
things for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are some of my I mean,
I've grown them over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again in every situation imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, greenhouses like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one indoor outdoors is the biggest
pain in the ass because you kind of have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go till close to November in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those pictures were taken probably
like October 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a number of years ago now,
but that was late October right before
[SPEAKER_00]: Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they do better sometimes as as as
greenhouse plants, because you really have
[SPEAKER_00]: to get nice weather to get them to their
full end.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a while to form out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's a lot of times where
like like we just did like right right
[SPEAKER_00]: after right after Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get as close to Halloween as I can
and even go a little past it if the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather stays nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in a greenhouse,
you're a little more protected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather so you can inch out a few more
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it doesn't get as cold and you
don't get dew and you don't get all that
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's that's the you know,
that's the headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those weren't very big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were just plants put in 15 gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegged for probably three weeks,
four weeks and then and then they got
[SPEAKER_00]: flipped.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does she change from greenhouse to
indoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: How does she vary?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the beginning, it didn't really
matter where you grew her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's a lot of old buddies of
mine that change their whole situation by
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that inside because you get
basically one and a half to two per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's back in like the old single
ended Hortilux days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get one and a half to two per light
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fireweed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And outside, she was a little bit more she
like I said, she was you get good years
[SPEAKER_00]: and bad years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a potential on that if you
don't know the the bud to size ratio going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, you can get you can get a lot of larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can get a lot of almost weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a long time where you
were growing weed where like there wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: this like modern hash market like there is
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a ton of larf would make your trimmers
cry and was also problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to know how to trim that thing
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say now is she's aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes probably greenhouses the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can still do really well inside,
but she doesn't like bulb heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's fine with like, like, like actual
nature heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something about heat from a
lamp that she just does not vibe with at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I should I should shout out
because I have some friends that have
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to grow her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She eats like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is can be really hard the more she
varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more she variegates, the hungrier she
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when she's perfectly healthy,
it's actually really hard to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: variegation on her anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you bloom her when she's heavily
variegated, she won't come out nearly as
[SPEAKER_00]: nice a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she needs strong food and she needs
calcium, not so much cow mag, but excess
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can just put in straight
cowl without without the mag and she does
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but she can be hard to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the sours can be hard to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You overfeed the sour at the wrong time
and you kind of ruined it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ECSD doesn't like as much heavy
feeding is like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one probably would like it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I didn't I didn't actually like
send you those pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from that from that same greenhouse,
but the following year, I have this
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of like probably like 40 or 50
East Coast sour diesels growing in front
[SPEAKER_00]: and then my sour growing behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like this sea of green with
the ECSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as it hits mine,
it's all yellow and brown, because all
[SPEAKER_00]: those big fan leaves are eating themselves
and dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, before before harvest or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's like a line in the
greenhouse, you can clearly see where it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons why,
like, I think that side by sides are so
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, because to really assure that you
like people all the time now on IG,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially they reach out and they want to
like identify cuts based off a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: pics and something their buddy says,
yeah, it's really hard to do that with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the best case scenario for
proving it's real is either getting it to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone that you hope can identify it,
or trying to get the cut from a different
[SPEAKER_00]: source and growing them side by side and
seeing what you can see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, they I got
distracted by the comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude is convinced head banger is in
that fucking line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, fucker, I was there when he is
making that stupid ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but that's the thing is,
is that as far as diesel goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been reborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even like, you know, there's some
that I didn't name just because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even like the people that that it attached
their name to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other people that offer seeds
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The axis of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: IBL.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, there's no IBLs in the L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of but of but of of of sour and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not even any seed lines of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: out there other than what CSI is released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the popularity of me talking about it
and the fact that he released it and
[SPEAKER_00]: people found a bunch of fire and
especially in the in the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: by Chem D.
[SPEAKER_04]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: was fired, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has led to a bunch of people, you know,
clone sellers and various breeders all
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming that they have it because people
like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think they have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OK to want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's also a thing, too,
where it's like it's not even like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to sit on my high horse about it or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things where it's
like when interest and money comes along
[SPEAKER_00]: in something, all of a sudden it appears
in places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially the people that aren't like
particularly concerned about history or
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage and they're just trying to make a
buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, they're going to offer it for five
hundred bucks a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 15 or 20 people bite on it and they
make and they make a chunk of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they needed was a sharpie and a
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, I mean, I think honestly,
I don't have any idea if my headband is
[SPEAKER_00]: the real headband or the first headband or
the one from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we got it as headband in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just having grown it for that long,
I would definitely say it's closely
[SPEAKER_00]: related to Sauer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How, whether it's a parent or a sister or
a half sister or something, I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have definitive proof,
but just just looking at all those pics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can obviously tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, if you had a bag of it
or whatever, it it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people, it's their favorite
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be diesel bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be any number of any up and down
the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be next to the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be 90 down.
[SPEAKER_00]: She she variegates like the like the KMD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's so weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it makes sense, though, because it's
just to me, it's a super skunk trade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it through all different weird super
scouts without having to even touch KMD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I almost I've I've I've
almost had this thing that, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wondered, like, you know, I mean,
who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, what if what if KMD is
like an Afghan expression of of dog super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk and the headband is like a sativa
expression of dog super skunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, you know, within this within
the family, not saying it's the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just throwing it out there is like when
I look at them and I look at how things
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and I look at like leaf similarities
and stuff like that, they're obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important thing is to me,
like that sour and that L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: are two of my all time favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably in my top five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could smoke them all year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy them a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like quite a few of the other
diesels, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to put mine on a pedestal
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about people who qualify
diesels as roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that they are potentially in
the same scent profile?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think when you get that fuel
nose, I think that's only like a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees away from skunk nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got the same like it's got the
same like nose crinkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is this offensive?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bright, strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think that that sour and diesel
family is modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's the modern skunk family
that survived and we just were hunting for
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing that like mostly exists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to make you qualify this
again, because you always say that you say
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a mother skunk family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mean modern skunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: One family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mean modern Afghan family by skunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you mean by the scent profile,
the way the doesn't grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, like it, I actually probably
think it like this could get me in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's like I think it's like I
think sour diesel is like ancient skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is it's like
imagine if instead of breeding it towards
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus and floral and grapes, and all
that, you bred it towards gas and fuel and
[SPEAKER_00]: headband aromas and weird nose crinkle and
sour.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but we've never seen that in skunk
one.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's definitely not pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, you know, I think he I
think he intentionally bred away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also don't think that this is pure
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's got chem in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's obviously got some chem in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where and I think that's where
the power, some of the power and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the added density and stuff like that
comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you tend to think you tend to think
it's more skunk one based as opposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: the Afghan T base.
[SPEAKER_04]: For most, I don't know if I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I would say that I but I
also don't like quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to be I didn't I didn't send you
this pick either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that but our same friend Bald Eagle,
he had this Colombian strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I lost those in the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a picture of the headband
right next to that Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not the same, but man,
what did they look related?
[SPEAKER_04]: See, to me, when I look at like greenhouse
plants and outdoor plants, they all kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of look the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have that trained eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a lot more experience in the
greenhouse, seeing the variation between
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it would be hard for someone
who doesn't have that like me to to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to see that that similarity past it
all looks kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that's one of the benefits
of growing in Mendocino County and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 era was that you got to do indoor,
you got to do light depths, you got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor greenhouse, you got to do all
these different kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for someone like me, who keeps a
lot of the same strains around for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, that means you get a lot of
different expressions of the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really get you really get to see
how it performs in different conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super important to have that I think
I lack that for greenhouse and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's one of those things that I'd like
to eventually at some point in my life
[SPEAKER_04]: catch up on because I think it's super
important to be able to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost feel bad now because I got
distracted and I could I could have dug on
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone and given you various pics from
inside and different things and shown you
[SPEAKER_00]: how many how many different kooky ways
they actually look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, expressions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most interesting part to me is I learn
more about it and how plastic these these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to take it a step back,
though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that until I saw those Colombians,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It clicked something in me because before
there was this aspect of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Colombians that you would
see would be these big, huge, crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never really seen like too many like
somewhat bred Colombians in a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw that, I was like,
oh, so obviously, in skunk, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian element, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if sour diesels and this headband and
stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking about skunk one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I think skunk, I think
Afghan, Afghans, because that's what the
[SPEAKER_04]: right well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, to be to be fair, right,
just to take it even a further step back,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it seems like no matter what story
of sour diesel, or headband or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, you believe that it was a
merger of the chem family, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the with the skunk family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether you believe that was the MSS
cut, or you believe it was the RFK cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you believe it was the the DNL cut,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whatever, whatever, whatever tail of
origin you want to lean on, they all seem
[SPEAKER_00]: to agree that there was this blending of
chem family and some kind of 90s skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens when you blend those
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think all these different
diesels are showing us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, if I had if I had to get get my
guess on it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some that lean more Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some that lean more sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's in there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably there's probably more
Afghan than sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you look, it's there's a reason
why really good diesel takes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of people in a lot of cases,
11 or 12 or 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty long.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of Afghans that run 11 to 12
weeks, too, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reason I was asking was because
recently, you know, I've been digging
[SPEAKER_04]: through the old high times a lot in the
old magazines and all the home grounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I've been doing is going through
the old TMQs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been going through up until about
1985, going through all those and trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to figure out where was the first time
people were using the term skunk for
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like we kind of know that like the
term skunky started hitting heavy in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to see if anybody was
referring to Mexicans or Colombians or any
[SPEAKER_04]: of that other stuff at any point before
the 80s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never happened in any of these magazines
or any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up until they started referring to
Afghanis as skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, then you started getting red
hair skunk and, you know, Afghani skunk or
[SPEAKER_04]: the skunk bud, Kentucky skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it took up until that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't even know if any of the
Colombians or Mexicans truly had that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of scent profile to be adding to it,
to make a skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the thing is, is that so if
you take, let's say, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: that just for the sake of pure argument
with with speculation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That the the headband or the sour diesel
or something like that is a combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: some blend of super skunk and some blend
of chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just take that right there,
then from the super skunk side,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have Colombian, Mexican, some kind of
Afghan and then Afghan tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from the chem dog side,
you have no fucking idea, but you have
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of some kind of weird old Afghan
mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's more Afghan than it is
than it is sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that some of them
couldn't have a tall, leggy growth rate
[SPEAKER_00]: from some of that Colombian or some of
that Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was more referring to the scent profile
of skunk that most people identify with
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if even if you consider what I
just said is true, then sour diesel would
[SPEAKER_00]: have the Afghan that was in skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghan tea, the maple leaf that never
have mixed it with.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And adding the chem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chem, which to me, and this is
what I'm bringing up right now so people
[SPEAKER_04]: can see the illustration of it,
I think is also super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be doubling up on the Afghan tea
if that was the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I point to my little dog tongues.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that just a pure super skunk
without anything else, no chem in it,
[SPEAKER_04]: does the same kind of leaf traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be almost if that is the
case, if I'm correct on that, it would
[SPEAKER_04]: almost be like a doubling up on that
Afghan tea, reinforcing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and since we don't know the
origin of the chem at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we're not even 100 percent
sure what the you know, we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about the origin of the of the
maple leaf either, other than it came to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville labeled maple leaf, maple leaf,
and he named some phenos.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of mystery in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I will say, generally speaking
about sour is that it seems like it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa frame, most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it stretches, but that it has
some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies how much indica influences in
the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are pretty chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are a little bit more
feathery and a little bit more layered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has some density and some potency
from the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has, you know, the the stretch and,
you know, some of the buzz from the sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: and it blends in all these different weird
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just depends on because honestly,
that that New York City diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually told you, like, when you when
you look at it growing, it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar in growth in terms of the way the
plant looked to my headband cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for it was about three or four feet
shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went like squat and wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where mine kind of went big and tall and
floppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, as far as leaf shape and and
and, you know, serrations and leaf color
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way the bud formed, there was
quite a few similarities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looked like a much more Afghan
version of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stayed shorter and squatter and wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mine wanted to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throw like big four arms everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to grow bald eagle someday.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wouldn't look pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he has it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I lost it in the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's me, us fires killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, starting and starting in 2017 on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got evacuated three times
between 2017 and 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking nuts from three, three
different fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously, when you're in,
you're evacuated, it's really hard to care
[SPEAKER_00]: for your mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Losing my hair, if that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could have had an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some grain that went on or
whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, luckily, I share and I backed a
lot of stuff up from different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did lose some things in that era
that I have not gotten back.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good question that you can
actually comment on, because I think
[SPEAKER_04]: you're working on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about epigenetics affecting one cut to
acclimate into two?
[SPEAKER_04]: Different environments over a period of
time and reunite to be judged as being
[SPEAKER_04]: different or the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know, but I will say that,
you know, CSI and I have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment going right where we gave each
other our oldest sour diesel cuts and we
[SPEAKER_00]: gave each other our chem dog cuts and we
gave each other our chem D cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see, A, if we think
they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, you know, are there differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're absolutely positive, actually,
that the chem dog cut is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've been separated for,
you know, I mean, I think he got it in 06.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been completely separated and
never exchanged for the last 17 years
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm fascinated by this because I've
always had that theory about acclimation
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very interested to see how plastic
the Chem 91 cut is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also have another theory because
Chem 91, even in the S1s, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: freaking uniform.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's probably, you know, either bag
seed, bag seed, unintentionally self or a
[SPEAKER_04]: work line, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it won't be that plastic
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have something interesting I could add
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not, it's not definitive by any
level, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when him and I traded, right,
he runs a pretty simple organic setup
[SPEAKER_00]: these days, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's, you know, most of his most
of his blooms are geared towards seed
[SPEAKER_00]: making, which is obviously different,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we obviously veg different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were having a combo last week,
I think, and we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods and I do something right
now that I that some people call synganic,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is that especially in my mom's or
whatever, and I've been traveling and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, it's been easier for me to blend
some organic and some salt together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use that to grow my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Heresy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for you, it's probably that I used
it so much hate mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're like, Oh, my God,
give me the salt, you know, life,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I, I grew a blend of, I grew a
blend of salt and organic amendments and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that inside, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so I traded him some stuff and he
hit me up and he was like, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, your plants smell way
stronger and veg than mine do.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I found was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we started, so we started
chatting about what we were feeding them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and when he, he was growing
flour for market, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to do all these different,
you know, he used to do all these teas and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these amendments and all these extra
special things all the time to get it just
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's, you know, he's got,
he's got a decent amount of stuff going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, he tries to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grows really nice weed,
but it's like, he, you know, he's vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: organically with a lot of dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using some of that and then some
salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was, he straight up was like,
every plant you gave me is more pungent in
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom room than my own ship in veg,
which I thought was kind of an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: observation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that's going to lead to
or anything else, but it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it was interesting that he already
had that kind of feedback on it without
[SPEAKER_00]: even blooming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, your plants smelled stronger,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: In veg, I noticed it when I brush them and
when I touch them and when I work with
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then I go and I work on the same
strain that's mine and it's more muted,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that interesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, what I think it means
personally is that the plant wants what it
[SPEAKER_00]: wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give the plant everything that
it wants as far as food, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's able to do all the various
processes it wants to do and reach its
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of times with organic,
especially indoor organic, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: actually giving the plant everything that
it wants all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because, because it's like,
I kind of look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, might be blasting me for
people or whatever, but I kind of look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it like organic gives the plant a lot of
things that it likes, but sometimes it
[SPEAKER_00]: struggles to give the plant exactly what
it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you give a plant really,
really high quality, and I don't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: Athena or anything like that, but like,
like something like Kana or cutting edge
[SPEAKER_00]: or somebody that's actually decent,
if you give them really high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: salts, the plant has to do nothing but
absorb those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lie that people talk about
where if you use any salt at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll kill all of your beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't know this, but like,
or some people don't know this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the plant absorbs salt through its
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it absorbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't tell the difference between
a salt from like cutting edge or Kana and
[SPEAKER_00]: a salt that's organically derived.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, you're going to make so many
people so upset.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that one's superior to the
other because no, but it is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is, is that when you,
when you bathe a plant in nutrient that
[SPEAKER_00]: has salts in it, it's almost like an IV.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can just, as long as the pH and the
temperature is right, it can just absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: that food right up into it where in
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in organics, uh, those same salts and
those same things are bound up in like
[SPEAKER_00]: more complicated chains that have to be
broken down by microbes and bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to release the salts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that organics not going to do
other stuff like enzymes and, and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, a whole like soil food web and you
know, mycelium and different things that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, so there's all this complexity to
it, but essentially, um, it's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really hard to get a perfect
organic mix indoors in pots, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: small pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much easier to do in beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to do in large amounts of
soil than small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a bunch of moms,
you know, like a CSI does your,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times you're growing them in
anywhere from four inch to two gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found in the, in smaller pots,
it's easier to be synganic and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of, and have a, you're a bunch of
organic and then still feed a light PPM or
[SPEAKER_00]: EC, whatever you choose to use salt base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that just kind of gives,
and to me, the goal of an old mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially some of these things are 25,
30 years old is like keeping them as
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that are annuals that
should be dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, as, as Matt will tell you,
like once you get a plant on health,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, sometimes it can be a real
struggle to get it back to being fully
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes there's some cuts I've never
seen be go back to what they were no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter how healthy you try to get them,
you know, no, you know, what, what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: too is that when it is true that,
that salts will kill some organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's mostly at like high ECs and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeding really low or moderate,
it's not going to really kill your
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria or do anything like
that because the organic is producing
[SPEAKER_00]: salts too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times when people go into the
store and they buy bottles of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, like let's say you're going to
buy some kind of like some kind of blend
[SPEAKER_05]: by reason why that shit costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that shit costs money is
because they already brewed it and made
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those big like organic chains
break down and some of those organically
[SPEAKER_00]: derived salts are in the mix waiting to be
used already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you just have to like,
you know, dust bone meal, or blood meal or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, wait for them to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most organic liquid amendments are just
people breaking it down for you ahead of
[SPEAKER_00]: time so that it's easier and more readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And easier to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but some stuff you put in your
soil, it might take two, three months to
[SPEAKER_00]: even break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what rate does it break down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what if your plant wants more of it
than you have to offer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get off on some kind of
nutrition tangent, but I will say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this can tie into sour diesel,
that I'll tell you a funny story from my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend John who runs Cutting Edge.
Okay.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this product he came out,
which is a carbohydrate product,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has some potassium in it that's
called sugary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a carbohydrate based sugar product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got these clients back in the East
coast to grow a ton of sour diesel and
[SPEAKER_00]: they call them up furious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your shit ruined our diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean it ruined our diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it ruin our diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your shit ruined our, it made our diesel
taste sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all pissed off because to them
they have to have the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he actually made a product called sour
D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the exact same product as sugary,
but instead of extracting the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates and sugar from sweet fruits,
he extracted them from tart, sour apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those people grew it using that
and the sour flavor came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even the development of the nose could
potentially be based on the type of food
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using and what it balances at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we just say that when elements are
analyzed, whether organic or salt,
[SPEAKER_04]: it will still be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so that's very true, but that's the 17
macro and micro elements.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not all of it's different types of
sugars that are just sugars or two
[SPEAKER_05]: different carbs change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe the sugars and the carbs like
feed different bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not saying I'm that that's
not a story that has a definitive ending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an anecdotal story of like,
he changed up his nutrient a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and it changed the flavor profile of the
same strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember botanic care offered like
grapes, sweet, like all these different
[SPEAKER_04]: kinds of sweets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always wondered if that was legit,
like berry and like, yeah, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning it was just sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they came out with berry sweet
and yeah, they came out with a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ones, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I haven't actually done that
experiment with the sugary or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that I have some friends
that grow in living soil and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: some similar strains that, uh,
that other friends I have run that grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: a very different style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, um, the living soil stuff is,
is overall much sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, much more sugary
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it just, I'm not even talking about
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean like the weed that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's, it's, it has like,
uh, it has like a sweeter, like some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those, some of those like, um,
other flavor profiles aren't pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a friend who grows the
exact same stuff in salt and they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: much different flavor profile than the
living soil people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely believe that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's kind of what I'm saying
is like, I'm not going to sit here on this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode and try to like, tell you anything
definitive about why I'm just saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: certain strains are sensitive enough that
even what style you're growing and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeding them could potentially
impact the chain of things that occur that
[SPEAKER_00]: make the nose that you perceive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you recognize, do you recognize this
cut yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: The one we haven't touched on that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the day wrecker.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one you haven't flowered yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, is that, is that what your original
diesel day wrecker?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what she looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have, I have had it for,
I don't know, a number of years now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never actually noticed the flower
little dog tongue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have any, I noticed the little
dog tongues and the, the Fox tail is very,
[SPEAKER_04]: it has a lot of sour traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen that picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, some of these are grayskulls and some
are, um, um, um, um, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgetting his name off the top of my
head, but he deserves credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great pictures.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that, that one is a, that one's
also, um, that one has been percolating in
[SPEAKER_00]: the collection for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that it'll bloom it this
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that one, you know, Matt gave to me
helpfully labeled original diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know any history behind it by
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: that some people call it the day wrecker.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hard one to trace back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow it next to my other
diesel family cuts and see what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly grows a little differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bushier to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I think PIP would PIP agrees
on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the more potent of the diesel
families, one of the most potent like it
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is narcotic as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say it draws from the Afghani end
very heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days does it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know PIP would say 84,
but how many days would you take it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 70, 77 right in between there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in that same range.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in that same range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, that's one I have to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great greeter, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great greeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think not just catching a laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of cool discussions going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I catching a lag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of cool comments about
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've thought about doing like a solo show
recording about nutrition for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't actually pulled it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, it's like a fascinating topic
because I've grown for at different points
[SPEAKER_00]: in my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown the exact same strain side by
side under same, same everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but feeding them different.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys think about a not so
story hour show, too?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good I've been trying to
push him to do it because he's he's very
[SPEAKER_04]: good, like an audiobook voice,
like with not being interrupted by me
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, yeah, all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know people get annoyed by that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're trying to, you know,
continue the conversation and make it not,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So prod him, poke him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's my it's my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have done it, but I haven't done
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but nutrition is something that is it
affects sour and diesel cuts a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it affects a lot of strains a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of those things where it's
the closest thing to religion that weed
[SPEAKER_00]: growers get, where they're convinced that
whatever they're using, whatever they're
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding, especially organic and K and F
and living soil types that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: stumbled upon the word of God.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you try to talk to them about
what you what you've experienced,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it can be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be, you know, I mean, they can't
burn you at the stake, but they might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some Salem witch trials or
something like that, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's I think salts get a bad name in
certain regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think organics, you know,
is poorly understood in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to hijack the whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is it is interesting, much more so
than almost any strain I've grown or any
[SPEAKER_00]: or any family of strains that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start playing around with food and
light spectrum, you will get way different
[SPEAKER_00]: results with diesels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you really will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've grown, you know, I've grown them
under different light spectrums,
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halides, high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double ended ceramics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start changing the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that really responds to
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes it so hard to
identify, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under ceramic metal halides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember it almost had like a more cushy
type, but it wasn't Fox tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked almost delicate, small,
cushy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really weird for a sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ECSD cut chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was just saying in the comments,
I'll just a bottle or poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bottles are just a bottles are
just a form to hold a liquid.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you get like a really
high quality hydroponic nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially one that's made out of high
quality minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those minerals are just pure forms of like
the what the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, salts get a bad name because
cheap salts have heavy metals and have
[SPEAKER_00]: other bullshit and are derived from things
that aren't that nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, really high grade salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally just like, you know,
it's there's minerals that the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbing and they have them in this order
and they get them from a really clean
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it looks like we made it an hour
and 45 minutes in talking about diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's lovely components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's also some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, in the beginning,
nice argument for your Thanksgiving
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people will probably hate me for
saying certain things about this evening
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I say the most innocuous things
about diesel and I get hate mail because I
[SPEAKER_00]: poked a hole in somebody's story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not to tell anybody that they're
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this is just our opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not always poking holes in someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I mean, it's what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to give a shout out real
quick to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me stand up so I can get this in the
camera.
