[SPEAKER_04]: I started, I ended, I killed, what's up
with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Got people at once, didn't answer,
what's in my name, nevermind I'm out,
[SPEAKER_04]: where's the other world?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out, where's the other world?
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a brand new set of words, and they're
growing, braiding, cheap I'm gonna stop
[SPEAKER_04]: for a second, questioning, falling The
words, condescend, just in one sharpening
[SPEAKER_04]: punch What's in my mind, right,
just doesn't stop, just do it for fun I
[SPEAKER_04]: started, I ended, I killed, what's up with
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Got people at once, didn't answer,
what's in my name, nevermind I'm out,
[SPEAKER_04]: where's the other world?
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you noticed, or maybe haven't
noticed, or as far as in those regions of
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanistan and Pakistan, I've noticed
there's a lot of people popping up,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially on Instagram, as Instagram
became bigger, especially for cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you noticed a lot more hybridization?
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally try and just ignore most of
the people doing those things,
[SPEAKER_02]: but every couple of years I sort of maybe
get curious about what they might be
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, and it's always, I mean,
the thing is, I don't really know what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're up to, for the most part,
it worries me because I suspect most of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, based on what I've heard,
have been involved in also bringing hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: seed over to places as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't substantiate that beyond some
forum things I saw in like 2018,
[SPEAKER_02]: when there was suddenly the 2018ish,
there was this sort of big realization
[SPEAKER_02]: among some of these characters that,
oh, we can get seeds from these places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, there was sort of
wanting to, there was certainly some of
[SPEAKER_02]: them were wanting to bring seeds up to
places like Parvati and Malana,
[SPEAKER_02]: the sort of typical Himalayan areas for
charters in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and then I saw these ridiculous
kind of excuses being made, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some kind of wind climate,
type micro-climate to do with winds that
[SPEAKER_02]: means that any pollen from the hybrid that
we bring up to Malana is not going to...
[SPEAKER_02]: You can imagine them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just after that, I wrote a kind
of couple of sort of irritated things back
[SPEAKER_02]: then on that old blog and about the amount
of bullshit that's spouted and then just
[SPEAKER_02]: thought, fuck it, it's going to put me in
a bad mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't like going on social media
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to put me in a negative state of
mind anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just have chosen to ignore it and do
my own thing really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't give anyone an informed opinion
about what exactly is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up to a point, I know certain outfits have
like stolen stuff from people who supply
[SPEAKER_02]: me as in like they've supplied,
like I know one outfit that one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys who supplies me has sent seeds to
then they didn't pay him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just knocked off his strain and
sold the seeds and kept the money for
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know there's outfits that are that
shitty, but that's like I can only,
[SPEAKER_02]: I only know that because it's intruded on
my world as it were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't correctively been seeking out
knowledge of what they get up to because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just, it's not conducive to being in
a positive state of mind to involve
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I mean, I mean, to go back to the
plants and stuff, like one thing I think
[SPEAKER_02]: is probably worth clarifying for people,
Himalayan land races, as in we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: between sort of, you know, Nepal and
Kashmir are a distinct group themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not Indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not true tropical sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're another kind of group within land
races that's very clearly distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're much taller plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They generally are triple use
multi-purpose plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're for seeds, for fibre and for
hashish, charas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not, you know, they have a,
the Carnabinoid profile is typically like
[SPEAKER_02]: a Central Asian, you know, a field of them
will break down into like type one,
[SPEAKER_02]: type two and type three Carnabinoid
profiles to hemotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're a very distinct group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem with people bringing Dutch
and genetics up to Malana and stuff is you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see it's just that around that area is
very obviously not the same as it was even
[SPEAKER_02]: when I first went there, you know,
it's very clear that there's that skunky
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch kind of effect, not just the smell,
the sort of effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there one time and this real kind of
crazy old timer guy turned up who'd bought
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of like Thai brick weed with him
in his phone, flown from Bangkok to India
[SPEAKER_02]: because a couple of hundred gram like
brick of weed from like Cochang or
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere Cochang and just a maniac,
you know, but anyway, he had a bunch of it
[SPEAKER_02]: with him in this guest house and it was
very interesting, like smoking some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that side by side with the, the,
a lot of what you could find in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Manikaran places at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was at least 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the effect of the,
the stuff from around that end of Parvati,
[SPEAKER_02]: there'd been so much Dutch stuff brought
in by that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell of it was like that real kind of
skunky, pissy, Eurorhinol aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was a very un-euphoric buzz
compared to what I associate with that
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you smoke the Thai stuff and it
was really kind of up and zingy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the, you know, yeah, it's just
really stood out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like similarly, if you, if you go to areas
of the Himalayas that haven't had that
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction of foreign hybrid seed,
the effect is of the Charas in the sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: unfashionable bits of the Himalayas to go
to is the old school real stuff that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: been obviously fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect of it is much nicer,
you know, it's like much more uplifting
[SPEAKER_02]: and positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's rarely something with skunk one in
it that I can smoke because it always
[SPEAKER_03]: takes me to a very specific, like negative
space in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually I can pick it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taken a long time, but I can pretty
much like, yeah, pick out anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: has skunk one in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's very few exceptions that I find
something I love, you know, that has that
[SPEAKER_03]: in it at least, you know, 50%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the, anyway, the most of the
continuations of it have been selected for
[SPEAKER_02]: the sort of heavy side of it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's mostly in the UK, if you get
something skunky, it's anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be like a Hindu Kush skunk,
Afghan skunk, whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so it's doubly like leaning that
way anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing to bear in mind as well is
that like, that's not anyway, the if you
[SPEAKER_02]: look in Afghan land races themselves,
Hindu Kush land races, whatever that whole
[SPEAKER_02]: zone, they're not necessarily like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not necessarily sedative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some of them clearly are
predominantly like that, but there's such
[SPEAKER_02]: a wide range of phytochemical,
you know, chemo type, whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: in these populations that aren't going to
give you that type of effect as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no, we're not kind of stuck
with this as long as we can actually keep
[SPEAKER_02]: some good representations of like pristine
land races in storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there will always be the
possibility of creating new things that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, you know, it gets back to your
original question of like, why did I get
[SPEAKER_02]: into this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, a lot of people, the sort of
standard narrative is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the UK, the standard narrative is
around the year 2000, suddenly all this
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid stuff arrived and it was just too
strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, not really, I wouldn't say
it was too strong was the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect was just, it wasn't very
fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people didn't stop smoking
because it was too strong so much as it
[SPEAKER_02]: was just a dysphoric effect from so much
of it compared to what they were used to
[SPEAKER_02]: from the traditional stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mostly what people, people say,
oh yeah, I used to make me paranoid and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, the assumption is that that
that's because it's just too strong,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not necessarily that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have very strong probical sativas
that primarily don't make you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly paranoid, you know?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's widely talked about
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, actually you can have a
plenty of, you know, strong highs of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis that are really nice,
you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't evoke a paranoia and all that
other shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: General kind of grabby, dirty feeling that
you kind of get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it's not, you know,
again, I'm always very wary of talking
[SPEAKER_02]: myself into a corner of doing kind of
anti-modern stuff, which I'm not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I'm just pro kind of
pro-diversity, pro-possibility,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why I think it's worth preserving
as much as we can of what is left of these
[SPEAKER_02]: things so that there is that option in the
future of taking the plant down different
[SPEAKER_02]: routes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sort of default assumption that
we've already arrived at the pinnacle of
[SPEAKER_02]: what can be achieved in cannabis that was
so much a part of the last 10 years of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis discourse.
[SPEAKER_02]: This assumption that's like, yeah,
you know, these elite cuts and stuff are
[SPEAKER_02]: like the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, I'm not at all sure,
but sure as fuck aren't like the all there
[SPEAKER_02]: is to be, to be achieved, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to explain to people a lot of the
quote unquote elite cuts in the U S like
[SPEAKER_03]: most of those are picked out of two,
three seeds, you know, like in someone's
[SPEAKER_03]: closet, like in, I mean, elite's
definitely, uh, it's very rare that I find
[SPEAKER_03]: any of those old clones that have been
passed around that everyone universally
[SPEAKER_03]: agrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so rare to ever find that,
you know, there's very few.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the, the clone market in the U S
has been completely taking over lately and
[SPEAKER_03]: with that spreading of HLV.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of like the past few seasons of
what I've been doing is trying to explain
[SPEAKER_03]: to people the necessity of seeds versus
clones as well in the U S.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that a bunch of the Spanish or
Spanish clones or stuff from here that
[SPEAKER_03]: went over there has murdered some of the
libraries over there of some of the old
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch stuff that they had been keeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's not slowing down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not slowing down anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I wasn't aware that this is the
hot blatant thyroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just basically fucked everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a scenario where we're paying the
price of how fucking homogeneous all of
[SPEAKER_02]: our stuff is already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's bad, but I hadn't realized it
had actually got to the point of like
[SPEAKER_02]: trashing people's collections as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, with one of the bigger clone nurseries
that I know of and they'll remain
[SPEAKER_03]: nameless, but, um, they are pretty content
with 3% of clones going out with HLV
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's so inundated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's assumed that 3% is, is the best that
they can do not 0%, but 3% is like
[SPEAKER_03]: winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you are constantly testing constantly
because they're still bringing stuff in
[SPEAKER_03]: because everybody wants this cookies
renamed, whatever the new name for cookie
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff is today, you know, and,
and it's still working on people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, um, the education is out there,
but it's, it's not being accessed or
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe, you know, there's a big difference
between smokers and growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, there's a wide pool that just,
it's really hard to get through because
[SPEAKER_03]: most people that I've encountered here,
the attitude is why do you care so much?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a very standard British
attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's all just weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, Americans coming over to the UK
are just like, uh, you know, when they see
[SPEAKER_02]: what's available to someone who is just
randomly turning up in England,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's dismal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unless you grow for yourself and
we happen to be in a city that's
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly like weed orientated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very dismal, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, that's, that's this,
this is what I've always had in mind is
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, there is going to come a
point and I had run across the HLV issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not something that impacts me
directly with the way I'm operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't been looking into it,
but it was always, you know, there's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to come a point where something's going to
come along that's just going to fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: decimate, um, the situation and people are
going to realize just how fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: homogenous everything is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so based on such a small handful
of, for the most part, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Dutch and American lines, you know,
there's, you could probably count them on
[SPEAKER_02]: two hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I expect the main contributors to the and,
and, and, and people don't, people,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially sort of below generation X
don't really have any sense of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think unless they're nerds, you know,
unless you grew up in, in the sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-hybrid era or happened to be
interested in the actual growing side of
[SPEAKER_02]: it, there's no reason why you'd
necessarily realize, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's one of the problems as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, with, uh, uh, groups who are doing
collecting is a lot of them, I can tell,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, not from an age, uh, from a generation
where they're necessarily even going to
[SPEAKER_02]: know what a pure land race looks like in
Thailand or Cambodia or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, something that to me would be so
obvious that it's been hit with something
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch or American that genuinely might not
even realize that it I've had people
[SPEAKER_02]: contact me saying, Hey, I'm in Cambodia or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found these great plants and it's like,
yeah, they do look like pretty cool
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but I can tell from just a photo,
they're not lacking in, uh, Afghan and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, just don't realize, you know,
they're still, they're still worth
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, but it does, it does matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between them and the
pristine population does matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, there's no reason like why
they're, that they're not like bad per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that they are introgressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're down the route of total
modernization.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're well down that route already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not, not even half as valuable
as the real thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's well put.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a lot of experience with,
um, maybe Southeast Asian is correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: With, uh, Thai and Laos, I've,
I've heard, you know, some of the stories
[SPEAKER_03]: that, uh, it was Laotian farmers bringing
down stuff to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is, um, is there any veracity to that or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's more the, um, the, um,
I mean, the, the thing to bear in mind is
[SPEAKER_02]: again, like, it's, it's, it's really
important, like really worth, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: bearing in mind is that these political
boundaries are very modern creations for
[SPEAKER_01]: the most part that don't have any real
significance in terms of, and the culture
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, if you picture the,
if you picture the Mekong kind of running
[SPEAKER_02]: from up in sort of the East of Tibet down
into Southeast Asia from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: through the golden triangle and down
through Thailand and Laos down towards
[SPEAKER_02]: Cambodia, all along the Mekong either side
of the Mekong is, it's basically ethnic
[SPEAKER_02]: Lao anyway, once you get into Thailand
and, and Lao.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, large chunks of Thailand are like
Isan where, which is the famous,
[SPEAKER_02]: the famous Thai stick areas of Thailand
are all ethnically Lao anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't really a question of people
bringing seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's just that the culture,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, if you look at the early
historical, uh, writing, um, in so far as
[SPEAKER_02]: there is any in, um, Thailand about
cannabis, um, I think there's some from
[SPEAKER_02]: the sort of 18th century or 19th,
I think we more 19th century.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the earliest references that I've
seen people find found, uh, to ganja and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in Thai literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, the, the, the, the Thai writers are
very much emphasizing that this is a Lao
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was in the context.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the really early references is in
the context of a kind of historical epic,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, which is a, about the, uh,
huge war between the Lao, uh, kingdom and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Thais that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, basically, I think it was 1830s,
maybe I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't quote me on the dates,
but not super long ago, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the Lao kingdoms got quite
expansionists, uh, under a guy called Jao
[SPEAKER_02]: Aniwong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was, they got ambitious,
tried to sort of seize bits of Lao and in
[SPEAKER_02]: return, the Thais basically just
annihilated, uh, Vientiane and all the big
[SPEAKER_02]: cities of, of Lao particularly,
like literally raised it to the ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: moved all of the population into Isan,
into Thailand, across the Mekong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, because they wanted to have more
people there because it was one of the big
[SPEAKER_02]: problems the Thais have always had is that
the population density was too low for
[SPEAKER_02]: them to sort of, uh, tax farm the,
they wanted more people there to tax
[SPEAKER_02]: basically for the state to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, so it was a kind of,
um, the reason there's a very big Lao
[SPEAKER_02]: population in Isan is partly artificial
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot of people moved and,
um, the, um, the culture from a very
[SPEAKER_02]: early, all the indications are is that the
cannabis is associated in Thai culture
[SPEAKER_02]: with, uh, rural, um, populations,
particularly ethnic Lao populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a very, very strong,
uh, status association in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Thai culture is very, very status
conscious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's worse than the English or any
kind of snobby culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, all of the politics of Thailand
are all about the big city, Bangkok versus
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the, the countryside basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this, the reason I'm giving all of
this kind of context is that it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: surprising to me at all, as someone who
knows these areas fairly well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not surprising to me that the law has
been changed back in Thailand now to ban
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, did they change it back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to buy sometime this,
I forget, they've got a few more months or
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps, and then they're going to just
ban recreational use again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another question about whether
they'll actually be able to enforce that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, at this stage, but the absolutely
no surprise to me at all whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the, the consensus has been that in,
in the Bangkok elite, that this should not
[SPEAKER_02]: be allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and they're going to do what the
British have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to basically copy our model
of like allowing some medicinal industry
[SPEAKER_02]: that them and their mates will get the
cash in on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the kind of industrialists and the lead
will get to make a killing out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal industry, but, and everyone else
can go fuck themselves and get a
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription or go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not much different than the
U S like it really ended up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same, it's the same sort of
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dialectic, whatever you want to say
this cause it's basically cannabis is a,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a, is a, is a peasant drug basically in
to put it in bluntest terms in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that some people have some
elite establishment types have a kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: affectionate attitude towards it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh, it's the country bumpkin kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people look down on it, disdain for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the hierarchy, you know,
in terms of things like, amphetamine and
[SPEAKER_02]: opiates and stuff in Southeast Asia,
that's about elite versus rural poor man's
[SPEAKER_02]: drug, rich man's drugs and various in
between.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and cannabis is definitely the poor
man's drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Oh, it's part of the culture,
quote unquote, but it's much more
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated than that in Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have a kind of sense of how
stratified and fractured all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: countries are in terms of the culture and
the geography and how that relates to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not straightforward that
they're going to legalize in India by any
[SPEAKER_02]: means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it is very strongly connected to
how the political establishment relate
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the, uh, minorities and village
communities in terms of how they see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all kinds of complicated ideas
about smoking versus eating it and which
[SPEAKER_02]: is smoking is generally not okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe eating it's kind of okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's so, it's not at all a question
that it's like, um, the shorthand that we
[SPEAKER_02]: in the West tend to go for like,
uh, the Americans came and banned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but no, not really that they were
moved to ban these things long before the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, uh, American hegemony or whatever was
a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and a lot of the, the,
the, um, British involvement, ironically
[SPEAKER_02]: was strongly lent towards not making it
illegal because the British were there to
[SPEAKER_02]: make money in, in India places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the loudest voices who were pushing
for it to be made illegal were generally
[SPEAKER_02]: Indians of a certain establishment type of
mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: In India that regarded this stuff as
unacceptable, you know, and that was
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing to do with, uh, them being
contaminated by puritanical Western ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were like locally born ways of
thinking about these substances that
[SPEAKER_02]: associated them with undesirable groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cannabis was very strongly associated
with Muslim culture in India, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, particularly the smoking hashish was
associated with Muslims.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as far as it had any Hindu
connections, it was associated often with
[SPEAKER_02]: village forms of Hinduism that we've seen
as being, um, sort of folk versions of
[SPEAKER_02]: Hinduism that were not sophisticated and
all were contaminated with, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, unorthodox forms of Hinduism
that were disapproved of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's all kinds of like nuances in
there in terms of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's not as, it's
pessimistic, but I can't, I'm not like
[SPEAKER_02]: anticipating some glorious future age of
legalization that's going to be around the
[SPEAKER_02]: corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, there was a while where I
thought maybe, maybe because the money
[SPEAKER_02]: will decide it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, no, it's not,
it's not going to, I don't think we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be like living in some global
legal situation anytime soon, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like no matter what happens,
it's always going to be putting the hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: the money into the hands of the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe opening it up,
you know, built this market, but closing
[SPEAKER_03]: it back down puts it back into the 1% type
situation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty difficult once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it's been, once you've got a
prohibition scenario, like extricating
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself from that, you know, it's not
straightforward, especially when there's
[SPEAKER_02]: such a strong plutocratic sort of
oligarchical tendency in our dysfunctional
[SPEAKER_02]: democracies these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, when you combine that with how
difficult it is to have a sensible
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion about these types of topics in
the, in the media these days, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it's very tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's people in the USA that,
you know, applied for licenses and
[SPEAKER_03]: because, and didn't end up getting it for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now they're on paper and now they
get rated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, yeah, it's, it's been wild to
watch it happen over the past,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, however many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't imagine it's going to get any
better anywhere after people have watched
[SPEAKER_03]: the rich sort of take over the whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know, like, I was very
optimistic, not optimistic, but I was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of cautiously optimistic that like,
even if it, wasn't for the right reasons,
[SPEAKER_02]: we might end up with legalization.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, and the quirks of the
political system in the States,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can have these sort of referenda
and stuff, referendums in places like
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon or whatever that we don't have
anything like that in the UK equivalent to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was sort of watching somewhat
enviously and thinking, yeah, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's only a matter of time before you've
got federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed Harris has been saying she's
going to do that and things, who knows,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean, maybe they will,
but it does require like some courage on
[SPEAKER_02]: the part of people in power to actually do
what they know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to any of these people,
they will know what they should do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they'll always do sort of some sort of
half-hearted fudging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, the chance of like
having sensible laws about actually kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of properly dangerous drugs is very
unlikely anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And particularly given that even the sort
of more enlightened discourse around these
[SPEAKER_02]: things is so incapable of, you know,
I'm thinking like, you see all this talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about psychedelics these days and
psychedelics this and psychedelics that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, okay, but,
you know, we're going to legalize all
[SPEAKER_02]: these things and then we're going to leave
like the actual shit like fentanyl and
[SPEAKER_02]: heroin and meth or whatever that actually
is really where you need to change the
[SPEAKER_02]: law.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were actually concerned about not
having all these people dying and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's like, you know,
cannabis exceptionalism, psychedelic
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptionalism and all this stuff is like,
there's a whole lot of conversation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't see it's going to feature
anytime soon in the sort of any any
[SPEAKER_02]: serious discussions, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just recently learned that in
Oregon, because someone got busted there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds, seed sales and stuff is a serious
felony.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do not like, you know, fully legal
with paperwork and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, dude went to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it blew my mind because when I think
of Oregon, like when I visited,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very open cannabis wise, much more
open than what where I'm at in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously, like I'm not up to speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like it seemed pretty,
I don't know, normalized there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the seeds, if you're not legal,
you know, you don't have all your
[SPEAKER_03]: paperwork in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot more serious penalties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so sort of so like, I mean,
it's such a big gray area with all of this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you know, in the UK itself,
totally uncontrolled in terms of moving
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds in and out of the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's zero regulation on it,
like literally none, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's as in to leave the borders of
the UK and come into the UK, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, for the destination countries,
this becomes infinitely more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But absolutely, it's so, it's so,
it's so, so sort of surreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the thing, though, I mean,
I tend to repeat myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just steer me on to something else if
I'm getting boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weird thing is with the UK is it's not
historically actually been a country that
[SPEAKER_02]: has tended to prohibit stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, narco colonialism was one of
the most controversial aspects of our
[SPEAKER_02]: history in terms of things like opium and,
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So colonial history and periodist history
of the UK was drugs were a huge part of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The elite discourse of this establishment
figures, you know, sort of liberal,
[SPEAKER_02]: old school liberal kind of 19th century,
18th century liberals.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, just like insofar as
they knew about these things, just didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, well, that's something they
do there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we make money out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we tax it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, subject, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the UK itself, like,
you know, heroin was available on
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription as late as the, the 19,
19, late 1960s, you know, you could still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was regarded as a,
as a opiate addiction was a medical thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The notion that it should even be
considered criminal was completely just
[SPEAKER_02]: anathema to the whole way it was dealt
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people like William
Burroughs and all these kind of beat type
[SPEAKER_02]: characters would come to the UK and stuff,
you know, because it was so, because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was such a common sense culture towards
these things, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they obviously went like off the
rails dramatically by the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And partly for actually kind of historical
reasons, not necessarily to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: America per se, but it was, you know,
largely sort of American led the move
[SPEAKER_02]: towards a more aggressive prohibitionist
stance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, you know, even our sort
of, I think it's probably the same in the
[SPEAKER_02]: States now, like, doesn't matter how far
right you go, really, most people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: conservative politics in the UK,
if you talk to them on a personal basis,
[SPEAKER_02]: even publicly now would be like,
yeah, of course, it shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: criminalized, you know, should be legal,
you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe politicians on the right
would say that privately, but definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: not publicly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's a religious thing
because our country is so religious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, sorry, what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it's a religious thing
because our country is so religious based
[SPEAKER_03]: or what the difference is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was definitely one of the major
dividing lines between the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and the UK was that there was a strong
disapproval of British imperialism,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly in Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in World War II, the Americans
were just very openly like, why the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: should we even be helping you guys keep
control of your colonies, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ignoring the hypocrisy of the Philippines
and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the attitude was that and it was even
before then that the League of Nations,
[SPEAKER_02]: when the first kind of international
attempts at prohibition happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking kind of 1920s and stuff,
it was the Americans and the Egyptians who
[SPEAKER_02]: led the move to kind of include cannabis
on all of the anti-opiate laws,
[SPEAKER_02]: which were the real driver of the first
attempt to like internationally prohibit
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs through the League of Nations,
pre-UN type idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the American Americans and
Egyptians who really led the charge,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially to get cannabis included on the
laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ironically, that was using data from
the, quote, lunatic asylums of Egypt that
[SPEAKER_02]: the British had actually put together
because they were kind of doctors and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff within the imperialist machinery who
focused on this idea that cannabis caused
[SPEAKER_02]: insanity and that it was associated with
criminality and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was partly British material like the
research that supported the idea was used
[SPEAKER_02]: to support the idea that cannabis might
somehow make you insane or was associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with violence and criminality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, because the British even though
they didn't want to ban these things in
[SPEAKER_02]: India, were still quite happy to use the
association between cannabis and like
[SPEAKER_02]: marginal groups, you know, groups of men
hanging out on street in parks and in
[SPEAKER_02]: urban centers like laborers and stuff,
smoking cannabis or what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were quite happy to kind of
police these groups using, to control
[SPEAKER_02]: these groups using cannabis, you know,
so some kind of radical dervish gets
[SPEAKER_02]: conscripted into some army unit and it's
causing problems in the barracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he smokes hash, he's insane,
put him in the lunatic asylum,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were still exploiting it to
control undesirable people, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was this kind of paper trail
associating cannabis with mental illness
[SPEAKER_02]: that was used as early as the 1920s to
kind of shoehorn cannabis into the
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-opioid opium laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could dig into this with you forever,
but I definitely want to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_03]: go over some of what you have in stock
because, I mean, yeah, I'd love to have
[SPEAKER_03]: you on, you know, whenever you have more
time too, because like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: each one of these topics, like you could
really open it up and talk about it
[SPEAKER_03]: forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what fascinates me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what I know least about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, far away like, because it's better
if you give me some questions so that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't just drift back onto stuff that some
people would have heard me talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start with, one of the ones I had
experience with was from the Highland Thai
[SPEAKER_03]: Burmese, I think it was called when it was
first released.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's, I thought that was an amazing
like a plant that could be done well
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how it would compare to,
you know, point of origin, but it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: done well indoor in the USA.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you tell me about that line?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that has been through a couple of like
ex situ maintenance grows now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna, I haven't directly been
involved with that since I originally
[SPEAKER_02]: collected the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there may have been inevitably going to
have been some possible shifts in what it
[SPEAKER_02]: actually is now just from the fact that,
you know, we can't do more than like
[SPEAKER_02]: double digits in terms of plant numbers of
maintaining it realistically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got it from, in Mehong Son from a guy
who, an expat guy who was based up sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, very near the border with
Burma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were Hill tribe groups who had
got hold of seeds and it's difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, hopefully we'll be finding out
soon based on genomics analysis of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: what exactly is in the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I suspect it may have a bit of
hybridization with more like kind of East
[SPEAKER_02]: Asian hemp lines in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just a pure, it's not like a simple
kind of pristine ganja land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's Tai Yai, like Shan is another
name for them kind of groups up in those
[SPEAKER_02]: areas who definitely have a culture of
growing cannabis for themselves sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was a real problem for this friend
of mine, or rather, you know, not friend
[SPEAKER_02]: of mine, but guy I met who was growing up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would do these kind of guerrilla grows
with tropical, you know, really nice like
[SPEAKER_02]: tropical lines, like kind of a carola haze
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the plants would get to like,
you know, within like a couple of days of
[SPEAKER_02]: just being just right, you know,
and he goes out to cut them down and just
[SPEAKER_02]: find some Shan guy has come and just taken
the whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like exactly when it's just like a point,
you know, he's like, oh, that's so brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they really know exactly how to
grow it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, they're waiting for the
perfect moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The day before he goes out to get them,
take the whole fucking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what always scared me about
guerrilla grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like here they say plant one for you,
plant one for the cops, plant one for the
[SPEAKER_03]: thieves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thieving is not great, but it's what it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so I think they were Lahu,
the actual guys who got the seeds from
[SPEAKER_02]: that Lahu, kind of like Musa is another
name for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like kind of a minority group who
are around those border regions a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, you know, Hill tribe would
be the kind of people would use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they move across the borders between
China and Burma and Laos places quite
[SPEAKER_02]: readily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they were growing and got hold
of some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is around there,
there's quite a lot of cultivation of
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber types, land races as well in those
areas, particularly because it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: encouraged by the Thai government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's quite a high chance that
there's been hybridization between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience of it was it was not like a
highly potent compared to what you can
[SPEAKER_02]: have in land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the very tall plants as well,
plus the hollow stem tendency made me
[SPEAKER_02]: think like, quite possibly there's some
hybridization happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's certainly other lines where
that's plausible that that's happened
[SPEAKER_02]: because they are growing on the same
growth cycles as the hemp and ganja are
[SPEAKER_02]: grown on the same growth cycles quite
often in those areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's possibility of crossing between
populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking about it, like asking
you to explain any of the different
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles and stuff like that, but it
really doesn't translate like because like
[SPEAKER_03]: you said, it's a very plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to in the sense that like
the nuance is so hard to get right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, when I saw them,
like he deliberately had brought down like
[SPEAKER_02]: to the two kind of main expressions of
that Thai land race that I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it may be something totally different from
what the high and Thai that goes around in
[SPEAKER_02]: America under the same name, by the way,
it was probably I shouldn't have used that
[SPEAKER_02]: name for it just as the confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he brought down like a very much more
kind of light green and the light green
[SPEAKER_02]: and the purple batch of the same land
race.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the purple batch was much more kind of
down the mango, carrot-y end of the smell
[SPEAKER_02]: types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the light green I much preferred
was more kind of like, it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: describe, but it was sort of citrus,
but not like straightforwardly,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like very kind of musky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to describe smells,
but it was a much more compelling smell
[SPEAKER_02]: for me and I'm sure would be the
preference if I was working the line was
[SPEAKER_02]: that side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, the other thing,
the reason I suspect some Chinese hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: type, East Asian hemp type is the leaves
could be very broad, not like with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica shape per se necessarily,
although I need to actually look at them
[SPEAKER_02]: again to see where the broadest point is
on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just anyway look like something
quite distinct from the real kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: classic Lao, East Asian, Thai type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simple, you know.
