[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_04]: clan-destined scene through the eyes of
the folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
NotsoDog, Breeder and Grower from
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my fellow host, NotsoDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are here for another weekend of fun,
fact-filled journeys in strain history.
[SPEAKER_07]: So tonight, we were thinking about
covering something that we don't normally
[SPEAKER_07]: talk about a whole hell of a lot,
as far as getting deep into the details of
[SPEAKER_07]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since it's a modern line, we try to spend
our time on older lines, for the most
[SPEAKER_07]: part, and a lot of the baselines.
[SPEAKER_07]: But cookies, I feel, has become somewhat
of a baseline now, for better or for
[SPEAKER_07]: worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you, Matt and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly picked starting history a
long time ago, simply because there was
[SPEAKER_00]: way less people to get pissed and complain
about what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also one of those things that
it's probably not well known by a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of disparate facts and
little bits and pieces that you gather up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been slowly working our way
towards more modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cookies, obviously, and that whole
family that it spawned, is a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot more delicate, because
cookies is also intending on being a
[SPEAKER_00]: global brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of business and money
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as simple of a clandestine
story as maybe some of the older stories
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the people are still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different angles we
could attack it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll pick some of them and go from
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking, let's start with a quick
discussion on the culture in 2009,
[SPEAKER_07]: roughly when cookies was starting to gain
its foothold.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of stuff was going on in NorCal,
the Bay Area, when cookies was blowing up?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little bit during the purple
craze and all that, yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it slightly after?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it was later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, what would you consider the start
of, I heard about this thin mint cut?
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't start hearing about it until
2010, right around then.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's just say, obviously,
as with anything, there's people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it spreads slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually it becomes more common
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like a famous thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, I still lived in the same
area that I do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still lived in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Bay is only where all this kind of
begins is like only a couple of two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hours south of us for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two things are pretty tightly
related in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of back and forth in the
cannabis scenes between the Bay Area and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Humboldt, especially, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, honestly, probably in the
2009, 2008, 2009, 2010 era, I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: that era for both the Bay and Mendocino
County was still significantly a gas era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the diesels and the
headbands and the cushions, especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: were all in high demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting good pricing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots and lots of people were growing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of like the bread and
butter, if you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's kind of like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's obviously there's way more to
it than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of like, what was the the big
dynamic back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, so 2008, 2009,
you know, there was an enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush being grown in the hills by me that
was all destined for clubs down by you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, so Cal area, there was a
big oval in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bay was sort of a meeting ground in
the middle, you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the Bay was sort of like
the hustler area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bay was where a lot of all the NorCal
weed flowed into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the people in the Bay were
hustlers, even if they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there were, you know, there was
warehouses and stuff like that here or
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like land places were expensive and it
was the city and it wasn't as easy to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the way you could be,
say, in Humboldt or Mendo or somewhere a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more rural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So who were some of the players in the
early cookie scene?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to go over that at all or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I think I mean, there's,
you know, there's there's really well
[SPEAKER_00]: known players.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a few people that aren't
particularly as well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we could obviously step in
a bunch of landmines on this one because
[SPEAKER_00]: all these players are still active and
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure they have their own take on
it and their own version of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'd probably also be quick to
point out any kind of small discrepancies
[SPEAKER_00]: that might pop up as well to try to like
discredit the whole thing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, because cookies is not just
it's not like talking about a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other strains in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies is like the one that formed a
brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like it was like the
first modern cannabis brand in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and the cookie stores and
fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened that like, you know,
we could maybe talk about like where
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was at when it popped up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: The culture, the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, as far as as far as my neck of
the woods in northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the green rush was massively on in
my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008, 2009, 2010 were booming times for
indoor light depth, full outdoor of all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of things all over my neck of the
woods.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the indoor indoor pound rate circa
2008, 2009?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like for high quality,
the the prices people would have been
[SPEAKER_07]: seeing for quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you cushioned or like you could you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could get I could get forty
two hundred like in my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: For ins, you know, especially an idea,
especially for desirable things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, you know, gassy strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, certainly Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a lot of there was a
lot of game back then where people from
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern California their entire career
was like coming up to my neck of the
[SPEAKER_00]: woods, buying things at that and going
down to dispensaries in the southern part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the state and, you know, giving them to
them those dispensaries for three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four hundred dollar margin, five hundred
dollar margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was big business then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was that was full depth years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depths were big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there was still droughts back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, depths commanded good
pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did you did things well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of it was definitely a gas
era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not that there wasn't lots of
things being grown, but there was an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous demand for both Kush and diesels
of various kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all kinds of permutations of those got
grown quite a bit because they because a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the people coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, if if you wanted to
leave your area, the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that would leave Sonoma County or
Mendo or Humboldt or wherever,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they wanted to go somewhere and hustle
their stuff, they generally went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was San Francisco or the East
Bay in Oakland somewhere right around
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bay was sort of like a collection
ground for everybody from SoCal coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they didn't want to go all the way up
into the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was people from all over in
the bay looking to get it was sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clearinghouse for where a lot of the weed
from my region ended up at least
[SPEAKER_00]: momentarily, even if it was just passing
through on its way to somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, say, dispensaries in San Diego or,
you know, or L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: or anywhere like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was was booming in the bay during those
years, if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_07]: the Oracle, the GDP, all of that,
like a staple of that Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a staple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I would also say it was
starting to get by then it was starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get phased out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In favor of Kush and, you know,
I mean, Kush was getting still pretty damn
[SPEAKER_00]: high prices in Southern California down
that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had access to cuts, you know,
it moved easily and you got a good price
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that was certainly the
height of the the gas diesel craze,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of that sloshing around
Urkel and GDP and and Grapeape and Mendo P
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was more like 2005,
2006, 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like the wave of gas really
started to come through.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you think was the was the.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think made what became cookies
appealing in a time where yield was still
[SPEAKER_07]: relatively important, maybe not the most
important because O.G.
[SPEAKER_07]: had taken dominance and it wasn't like a
power yelder for most people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what do you think drove the
necessity for cookies all of a sudden?
[SPEAKER_07]: That drive and hype when there was already
O.G.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kush and there was already, like you say,
a waning demand for GDP in Urkel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it was a number of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one one thing you can say
about it is that Americans are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: tribal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly we're not tribal like we're not
tribal in the way that a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries are tribal, like we're a weird
mishmash of cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get tribal around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sports teams and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I think pushed
it was that I would say it's probably fair
[SPEAKER_00]: to say in California that L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and SoCal was considered like kushland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it was produced other places like
the craze, the money, the rap,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the Bay, cookies was really
something that like all of a sudden was
[SPEAKER_00]: the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Bay wasn't just like a
clearing ground for the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just like a pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something they could claim as their
own.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very much a Bay Bay set of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just like that, like you're going
to have fans of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just like you have fans like the
San Francisco Giants or the Oakland A's or
[SPEAKER_00]: the Raiders, you know, or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's our shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is unique to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, since it becomes
since it sort of started there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that were in the know and all
the people that first got it were kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humans like to feel like they're part
of something special.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes to be.
Huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody likes to feel like they're
on the end crowd on some on some aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you know, and a lot of the history
of a lot of the history of the of that
[SPEAKER_00]: that became, you know, and it made people
famous, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do think that cookies came along
at a really weird time in cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that it was a sea change,
in my opinion.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where probably before cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't going to make cookies sound
that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before cookies, most weed was judged
on its nose and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looks wasn't that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't tell you how many times
I've thought I would have people come up
[SPEAKER_00]: to my neck of the woods and they would
open up a contractor bag of sour and they
[SPEAKER_00]: would stick their head in it and look up
and say, this will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was before they even really like
dug around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they could still find something
that they didn't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, if the nose hit
them like a hammer in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were almost all the way there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cookies like, you know, is extremely
photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came about kind of at the at the
end of of a certain era where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, IG started happening and these
different social media platforms started
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you you can't you know, anything
you're looking at on Instagram or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else, you can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cookies and a lot of its children are
extremely photogenic.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that was the first thing that truly
caught my eye was, well, I'd seen stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember, you know, there was stuff that
would come out of different combos.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll get into that later that I'd
seen similar, but I'd never seen anything
[SPEAKER_07]: quite capture all of several traits in one
bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also saw the yield and thought
there's no way this is going to catch on.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just no fucking way this is going
to catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, I mean, and I think some
of it, too, is, you know, they they got it
[SPEAKER_00]: to some hip hop artists and they got it
and they and they got it wrapped about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's if you get it to if
you get things to cultural trendsetters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then other people might want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there was a lot there was a
lot of well-developed clubs selling a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of indoor in 2008, 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of Bay Area clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, if you had an active
medical card that checked out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could go make a deal with a club.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to have like today,
you didn't have to have a bunch of permits
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bunch of special rules and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You literally had a doctor's note and you
set up an account and you were allowed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was kind of the way 215
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was you were allowed to supply
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there and you know, what people
ended up calling top shelf ended up being
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of light debt back then
that made top shelf and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, when you're buying
something at a store, something that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: really attractive is a big seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way cookies looks, the way it's buds
form, they're very dense, they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that it has a tendency to color up
really like accents the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of visible crystal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it did kind of have like an
off cookie dough type of sweet aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's the first line that like
modern marketing really mattered with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were posting something up there for a
minute, but I couldn't see what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was just getting it ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a it's the video where they first
explain the genetics behind cookies and
[SPEAKER_07]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whenever we're ready to get into that
part, I'm going to toss that up so we can
[SPEAKER_07]: hear it from some of the first videos ever
posted by them, the cookie crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I'll throw in something like this
a little bit to where I Matt and I did a
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanksgiving show on sour because we
figured if you're, you know, fighting on
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanksgiving with families, pretty
traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we talk about something that gets
people riled up, that'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cookies is also probably going to rile
people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of big players that
are involved in cookies, and they all have
[SPEAKER_00]: their versions and stories and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, take this as sort of
like general tidbits rather than some like
[SPEAKER_00]: completely chronological, you know,
attempt to lay out the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, the history with
cookies, like I said, it's not just about
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about different people's careers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
Now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, lots of careers were set up by
different stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of stories are conflicting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard all kinds of stories from
beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what like I I've said in many of our
shows before, I've learned a lot of times
[SPEAKER_07]: you can if you grow enough progeny,
enough plants, enough seeds of a certain
[SPEAKER_07]: line, the plants will tell you exactly
what they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have enough experience and know
enough about the baselines, the plants
[SPEAKER_07]: will tell you exactly what they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I've always been more
interested in when it comes to cookies,
[SPEAKER_07]: not the people behind it, not the players
behind it, what it actually is and what
[SPEAKER_07]: we're seeing when it breeds, you know,
that's where I always run to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where that's where I'm mostly
going to focus my portion of stuff is when
[SPEAKER_07]: I talk about like the breeding traits and
how I see them breed and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can cover some of that historical
aspect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you want me just to fire up the
video now or do you want to cover anything
[SPEAKER_07]: else in the beginning precursor?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think the beginning part,
I think like if we're talking about like
[SPEAKER_00]: setting the stage for what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we probably you know, it's probably
it's there was a bunch of there was a 215
[SPEAKER_00]: was probably it was probably the height of
215.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The height, you know, is really when it
came out a height of 215 error.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of explosion of cannabis
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers coming into the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of younger people getting
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had spread to the point and become
chill enough to the point, even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: could totally get busted on a number of
different levels, that all kinds of people
[SPEAKER_00]: were jumping into it that hadn't wanted to
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business was booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensaries were booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was booming.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I remember correctly, like the
first cut I had heard of was cherry pie
[SPEAKER_07]: out of all of that group.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they had, you know, F1 Derb and a
few other things that were in their
[SPEAKER_07]: circle.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the first one that I heard about
before cookies or any of that was the
[SPEAKER_07]: cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was that was what I was most
familiar with online before the cookies
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of exploded.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had a similar look, but it was more
OG looking to me than the the nudge
[SPEAKER_07]: structure of the cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that something you guys saw up there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember a certain date of it
popping up or any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I you know, I'm going to I'll
dance around certain aspects of it just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the of what we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can say that there are some people
that were intimately involved in cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have gone way back with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew, you know, years and years and
years before this stuff came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was certain things that I saw
before cookies became famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the one of the guys that's
involved, for instance, he gave me the
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow Rider in, I want to say 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring 2004 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the first actual like
living in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit behind the Kush wave in
terms of like access to cuts that were
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the first one that I used to
that I used to I used to rock,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was that was four or five
years before cookies even popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just so happens because that same
crew had that Kush cut that that Kush cut
[SPEAKER_00]: is the is the Kush and cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's so I just believe it just
because of who it came from and who had
[SPEAKER_00]: access to it and all that different types
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any I there's a lot of stuff
that with cookie that's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I think is pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now what could what cut exactly
Flow Rider is, you know, is it is it a cut
[SPEAKER_00]: of OG masquerading under a different name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a different cut from Florida?
[SPEAKER_00]: All that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's a debate, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you when you got it, did they call it
Flow Rider?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they call it Florida OG?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they call it Flow Rider or did how did
that happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: What did that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to be perfectly honest, I you know,
I got it as I got it as OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I got into interested
in Kush and I'd heard a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and I went back to him and I asked
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear there's a couple of different
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he he said it was I mean,
I'll probably mangle this pronunciation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I never heard the word Florida OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it was a play on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was it was a Flow Rider.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost almost like how, you know,
somebody with an accent would say Florida.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my Southern accent, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but anyway, supposedly and I
don't know if this is true or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly it was it was it was sent from
Jacksonville, Florida to the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and at the time I thought my
buddy was like all generous for giving it
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I realized way later was that he
was going to he was giving me the same
[SPEAKER_00]: price he was giving me for diesels and
other things, you know, which was low
[SPEAKER_00]: fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was taking it to L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and like making mad loot off it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't get it like on some,
you know, it but that that that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still one of the best OGs I know of,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG and cookies is is a really nice
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of my first that was kind
of my first as far as things that were in
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie that I personally possessed flow
that that Kush cut is probably the first
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think what happened is in
a nutshell, we can bounce around and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of depth to all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But almost like the like the diesel story,
I think there was there was multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: accidental pollinations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, this this hermed onto
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew up seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing got named this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we played around with it a year
and a half later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This herms onto this, you know,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, yeah, we have we have
some pretty good video of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, pop it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, certain ones come in certain
sections, but basically of them making it
[SPEAKER_07]: very clear that it was probably herm
accidents because they say they have no
[SPEAKER_07]: interest in breeding at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So but let's pop up the first one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is this is, I believe, Jigga and
Berner and powers up Kenny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kenny Powers, they call him.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not the guy with the mullet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much different guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are discussing in a club.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the original video was called
Big Berner's Bigger Business Episode One.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, this is them discussing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's pop it up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down, Jigga, let them know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do they want to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, first of all, I see some YouTube
blogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said cookies got cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: To clear that up?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying there's a lot of shit to
clear up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let them break it down, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they want to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's let them know what cookies
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, there's a lot of like weed
magazines and and like all kinds of crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that are just put in false.
[SPEAKER_01]: The relationship between cherry pie and
cookies directly is like I would say more
[SPEAKER_03]: of a like a brother and a sister
relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the same parents, one of the
same parents, one of the half of the
[SPEAKER_03]: parent is the F1 Durbin crossed with a
with a granddaddy would make the cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: pie F1 Durbin crossed with the OG to give
you the cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where they get that relationship
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where, you know, there's no
cherry pie inside the cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Durbin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the F1 Durbin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And easy math for him real fast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, break it down, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down for easy math equation for
everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the F1 Durbin plus the Florida Kush
equals cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl scouts, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let them know what F1 Durbin is,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's F1 and Durbin Poison, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in your bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not regular Durbin Poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to have real cookies,
you would have to have what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to have real cookies, like the real
Girl Scout cookies, the ones that the
[SPEAKER_01]: football stick to fucking the hand,
fucking crazy, tasty, thin mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we call it cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thin mint taste, you got to have F1
Durbin Poison crossed together with the
[SPEAKER_01]: right OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different kind of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down, Jacob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know something.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they want to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, first of all, I see some YouTube
blogs where they say cookies got cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: To clear that up?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying there's a lot of shit to
clear up, so let them break it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creach.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they want to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's let them know what cookies
is, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of weed magazines and all
kinds of crazy shit that are just put in
[SPEAKER_01]: false.
[SPEAKER_01]: The relationship between cherry pie and
cookies directly is, I would say,
[SPEAKER_03]: more of a brother and a sister
relationship.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, it was supposed to be the
GDP and F1 Durbin making cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your thought on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might cause a bunch of... So what
I think happened, realistically,
[SPEAKER_00]: is I don't think they wanted anyone to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think they wanted anyone
to try to recreate what they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's fair to say that no
matter who they might be currently,
[SPEAKER_00]: back then, the guys that made it famous
were more hustlers than they were growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were more people that move things
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were deeply involved in the weed
scene and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were more middlemen than they
were someone like you or me, who was
[SPEAKER_00]: producing it, making seeds, growing for
market, all that different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just weren't that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think they were concerned both
that they didn't want to give anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All credit with cookies starts with cookie
fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a lot of places, as we've talked
about many before times on this show,
[SPEAKER_00]: you work off what you get first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get work from other people and you get
bag seed or you get this or you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it gets famous and then what
happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make it seem like it all
originated from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that maybe even back
then, I don't even think they all had
[SPEAKER_00]: their story straight with one another.
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt that they really even knew what
pollinated what.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think those guys could truly
identify a herm in a room.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was herming on what?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they did a lot of guesswork,
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There ain't the brightest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think necessarily speaking
it's not the brightest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine, I'll be fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just say that imagine that like
your story starts with bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have to now you have this
famous thing and it's blowing up and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you're starting to breed
and do some different stuff with it
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're trying to market it in a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like all the steps that got you to
where it begins, you didn't actually do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, for instance, it's pretty
well known that Berner was a budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't grow at all.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew rappers and he had a small hip hop
career that he was trying to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was an outlet and he hyped stuff
and he moved stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he he made that into like,
you know, he's a bit obviously he's the
[SPEAKER_00]: face of cookie now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's the man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's the one on Forbes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he's the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and that wasn't I don't
even think that was done intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was it was almost like I think
that as these there's like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you know, there's there's a loose
collection of people.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as fame comes and there's no contracts
and there's no formal, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, everybody starts reaching
for everything they can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was winners and losers in that,
at least so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people that are super well
known and there's a few people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: probably like more responsible,
at least for the beginning parts that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't very well known at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that seems to me to be a a common
theme in the history of cookies,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether you're at the beginning or you're
making your way down the road to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the the Lemonade era and all
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like it's a repeating story that
there are a lot of really sometimes even
[SPEAKER_07]: really talented people doing some work
behind the scenes that don't get the
[SPEAKER_07]: shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, well, yeah, there was
there was an era there was an era,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, where back then, especially it was
all about who wanted to show their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a couple of people that did not
want to show their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result, like barely anybody
knows who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like Berner and, you know,
and Jiga and stuff like that who were
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to be famous and wanted to use this
to make themselves famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became the face of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got a rap career out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and became CEO of cookies or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and he wasn't even involved
in any of the growing of cookies or any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the guy that got you decent tickets
for it and, you know, and gave it to Wiz
[SPEAKER_00]: Khalifa and these different people that
would hype it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these famous people had it and he
helped put it on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so when the people that
actually own cookies decided to,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, form the brand,
they got the face of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really care necessarily so
much about, like, you know, who was the
[SPEAKER_00]: most involved or who, you know,
they cared about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed a spokesperson.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of major corporations do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very common.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and Berner was looking to be
famous and, you know, was a good
[SPEAKER_00]: spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there was, you know,
I used to I used to joke that like there
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be a bunch of people in the Bay
that thought that they ate the cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: they were buying was like personal only
hand watered by Berner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard that a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: People would get in big arguments or
they'd be like, no, no, he's growing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, it was a real bad,
you know, and there was there was there
[SPEAKER_00]: was, you know, there was definitely crew
and the cookie fan that was growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that just wasn't his angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're just that just wasn't
his angle, you know, so and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so as a result of all this fame and
stuff like that, there's there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another aspect of it where all of
them tried to make as much of it as they
[SPEAKER_00]: could is out of out of it as they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it spawned it didn't
just spawn cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it spawned, although that came
later, it spawned Shurbinski's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the Sher brand and all that
different types of stuff and gelato and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and you know, and you know,
so there's like I mean, this could be like
[SPEAKER_00]: a multiple multiple, you know,
episode show, I suppose, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: angle you want to take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say going back, I do think that
part of the.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way to put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the confusion about cookie is that
in the beginning, some of them honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know all the steps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I and I do think that they also wanted
to obscure a bit what they did know
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't want any anybody else
to either get credit or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: go out and grab those things and start
making things, because as everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cookie seeds and cookie hybrids
and OGKB and then forum and an animal and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different things that were
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all commanded top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of money on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were always terrified of their
secret and their control of it getting
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, it got famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got famous at this weird time where
things were transitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was still that two fifteen gray
area time where nobody owned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nobody, nobody owned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no there was a loose group of
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was only shortly to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there and there really wasn't a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was even a thing where like
they would I don't you know, they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even let you know, they kept they kept
Berner away from the gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they gave him the clothing
company, which ended up being a dumb thing
[SPEAKER_00]: because he made a shit ton of money off
selling one hundred and fifty dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he was the real winner in that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and and it also didn't have
any risk because it wasn't weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just clothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to show a picture to the F1
derb real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from the Instagram account F1
Durbin.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is exactly what it looks like,
how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very true to form on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people question whether it's a
real cut or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's existed for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we grew it, it was heavy Merlot wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not so good at smelling like
aniseed in these turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I mean, I think it's probably
very easy to to have that in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know some people smell Coca-Cola type
turps, too, with that Merlot wine smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, this is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's not very well documented,
so I wanted to sneak it in here while
[SPEAKER_07]: we're still talking about the
predecessors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it ties into, like I said,
the multiple accidental pollinations that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the farther back you go in the
cookie story, the murkier it becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain things that I think we
know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain things that are known
that aren't very well known, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain things I might even
dance around just because they're stored
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, as any tale that involves
a bunch of friends over a long period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, you know, there's parts that are
pertinent and there's parts that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, could ruffle some feathers,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's stuff that you think and that
I probably disagree with, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: like in what's actually in specific ones
and specific things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, interesting about,
you know, we won't say what exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, there was this week
between CSI, Matt and myself, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: debates going back and forth on on lineage
of certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that have been skeptics,
maybe even coming around to certain
[SPEAKER_00]: theories or being more open to it because
they smelled certain things or saw certain
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and they were like, whoa,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to me, like, I don't know why I don't
why would you want to dance around?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we don't need to dance around it,
particularly on this specific one,
[SPEAKER_07]: because I think it answers a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a lot of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it OK if I just enter in a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, sure, we can,
you know, go for it, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, because we're already going
to do the the F1 DERB reversal at CSI's
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're going to answer a lot of
questions with it, at least to get an idea
[SPEAKER_07]: of what happens when you cross,
say, the F1 DERB and that Florida OG or
[SPEAKER_07]: the Flowrider.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you cross F1 DERB and GDP looking at
the F1 DERB, I mean, growing it when I
[SPEAKER_07]: did, I didn't I didn't have a lot of
insight into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew it, seeded it immediately,
lost it pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also didn't have the same experience
that I did that I do now looking back when
[SPEAKER_07]: I was growing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the main question of cookies,
I think that me, you and CSI talk about is
[SPEAKER_07]: where is all the black and purple coming
from?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we know Urkel can kick purples and
that's in my opinion, at least Urkel is
[SPEAKER_07]: the main main force behind cookies and the
look, the shape, a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not really well known for
consistently and and being a true breeding
[SPEAKER_07]: purple breeder.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of green coming out of
purple or purple, purple and GDP much the
[SPEAKER_07]: same.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is a consistent true breeding
black trait in that line.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we had talked about deep
chunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had talked about maybe it is just
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's like this recessive trait being
brought up and it's been slammed into each
[SPEAKER_07]: other enough that it's just consistently
bringing black now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe Mendo perps, you know,
and what we know about Mendo perps is it's
[SPEAKER_07]: it's it expresses a lot of different
smells in the S1 is one of those is heavy
[SPEAKER_07]: anise.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and that's always very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the fact that it breeds true
to black in a lot of cases is another
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting point to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit that this is a little
political or whatever, but I will admit
[SPEAKER_00]: that I did not believe for a long time
some of the stuff Matt was saying in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of not that I thought it was lying or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I, you know, I just didn't I just
didn't quite see it quite as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, different stuff starts
coming to light in various aspects and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things start bubbling up or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I I do tend to believe now that
Mendo P is in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's simply because,
you know, there's there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: connections between like Mendo and our
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those Bay Area cats in one way or
another, like I said, I mean, I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: long running relationship back then with
one of the guys that we did a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanging of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a we had a cut called Anis that
used to get pushed through the bay quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say the anus?
[SPEAKER_00]: The anus, which was which was which was a
strangely which was a Mendo perps Durban
[SPEAKER_00]: poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, interesting thing that we made that
hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you know, people should
know that with anything like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things that are that are
speculation and there's certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know for fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to always be clear about
the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I tend to think that it's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to think not that it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it got in there late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it got in there early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was an early contributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do know something that's not
particularly well known that I guess I
[SPEAKER_00]: could spout or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the mother plant that cookies
came out of was.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds that became thin mint,
right, that I guess started the cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: craze or or what have you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were grown by my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were rolling up a joint in the
bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my oldest friends was actually in
the room with with with these guys at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some seeds fell out of a cherry kush
bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds Jigga ended up making thin
mint.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cherry kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is different than the cherry pie,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supposedly cherry kush is made of
cherry pie, herms onto the flow rider.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeds from that they called cherry
kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cherry pie is known to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only herms, cherry pie throws actual
male, full male pollen sacks like live
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, live like not just bananas,
but actual it can pop full male flowers at
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tricky one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so so I know what the mom
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I and as a result of that,
I like I know what room it actually was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually the the room was grown in
Willets, which is a little town in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino County, about 20 minutes north
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out of a relatively small room
and there was only three things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of them were were cherry pie and
and that and that kush kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one was Elvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Elvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the other one was Elvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was there was only three things in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know what the mom was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were rocking Elvis and they didn't
use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not that they used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, to be honest, I think the first
intentional cookie breeding like by them
[SPEAKER_00]: came when they started messing around with
Sherbert, like when they started messing
[SPEAKER_00]: around, you know, in 2009, 2010,
2011, 2012, like that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think before they didn't really know,
you know, they didn't even have it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was different people had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting moved to different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like certain people weren't
smoking it or having it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like I think thin mint was sort
of the basis for them to like take off
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so you know, I wish I could
actually see comments while I was I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people that are dropping
some stuff that I want to that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to speak on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to toggle back and forth
between Matt's beautiful face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to miss seeing my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's so hard for me to read
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll see him if Matt pops him up
because he pins him or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's there's a lot of stuff about
like always be flowering and flux and
[SPEAKER_07]: frostboss and all those guys, people just
plug in names, trying to guess at who's
[SPEAKER_07]: who.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all good names, all good names,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if, you know, there's a
there's a part of me that wonders how
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to get on certain things and what
to stay like slightly mysterious on or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a couple of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was even a dude's name that started
with a C in there that was definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: involved on a certain level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know I'm I am ninety nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine point nine percent sure that what
became Thin Mint came out of Cherry Cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one thing I want to add here is when it
came to the forums, when it came to Girl
[SPEAKER_07]: Scout Cookies hitting the forums,
a lot of people are used to hearing the
[SPEAKER_07]: term forum cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when Girl Scout Cookies hit the
forums, Thin Mint wasn't something being
[SPEAKER_07]: passed around or bandied about.
[SPEAKER_07]: The name really wasn't something popping
up yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first time we saw it was I believe it
was always be flowering, passing it to
[SPEAKER_07]: someone either directly to lumpy lump
status or or to someone to lump status.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the first time a lot of
people really got a good look,
[SPEAKER_07]: like a really good look at big blown up
grows of cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were some of the most beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do believe those are still up there
on icy mag.
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody wants to go check them out,
lump status has some beautiful pictures up
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the forum cut was the one that the
cut that became called forum cut was the
[SPEAKER_07]: one that tended to circulate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thin Mint didn't start circulating till
much later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wanted to add that in there because a lot
of people are asking about the forum and
[SPEAKER_07]: when it came.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I mean, we me and a homie of
mine on this show, I'll just call Tuna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuna and I actually grew some of the first
cookie up in Mendocino because those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: were all stuck in like six and eight and
ten lighters or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to get they were
trying to get obviously more of it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, you know, and they were so paranoid
about anybody knowing what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they made us call it great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to ask him gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because because they didn't want anybody
on our scene, any of our workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made sure that like we could never
talk to anybody that was on our farm about
[SPEAKER_00]: like this was special or this was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were terrified of it getting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and they were pretty controlling on
it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not surprised that Thin Mint took a
minute to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what screwed cookie in that regard
is that in cookie lines, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodism and bag seeds get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how cookie kind of spread at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not passing it out to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not sharing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a thing that made a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was hyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was their ticket to ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't want to share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I'm not surprised that I'm
not surprised that the real Thin Mint sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of took some time to bubble out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the things that's kind of
funny, one of the things that swore me off
[SPEAKER_00]: of cookies for a few years was we ran a
couple of big greenies, a couple of big
[SPEAKER_00]: depths of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it fricking it hermed and seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were devastated because they didn't
want seeded weed to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't want us to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine how fun it is to have a
couple of greenhouses of weed that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want you to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of it was kind of before like
the the modern hash era had sort of taken
[SPEAKER_00]: off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't like you could just like,
oh, we'll just wash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we really wasn't it really wasn't
that era yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there was like a like a whole bunch
of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was you know, there was water
hash and there was some B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was Keith and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't like all the the modern gear
that people are used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't like the secret cups blowing it
up quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there wasn't even like,
you know, bang like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was like the if you were smoking it
back then, you were probably smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: glowing cherry banger and dropping
unpurged B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: into it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was the snap crackle and pop
era.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was it was it was it was
going to be we're going to hell for the
[SPEAKER_07]: shit we made and sold as B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_05]: early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ignorance, you know, ignorance is if
people didn't know at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, you know, people and,
you know, and then we didn't have a vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: ovens and all that different types of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a coffee filter, water bottle weed
in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the worst thing was was was,
you know, this is getting off tangent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like PVC tubes was the standard with
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would, you know, you would
put a cap on it and you would drill a hole
[SPEAKER_00]: through the cap and then you would like
pop, you know, cans of butane through and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then all of a sudden,
people discovered that, like, after you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that for a while, the PVC isn't smooth
anymore on the inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that weird how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little polyvinyl chloride or whatever
into your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's I mean, that's way off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I just mean in the sense that like
I discovered pretty early on that Cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: did not like food, sunlight and was prone
to hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think all the early cuts
that got out were a lot of them were bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then they got and then,
you know, we're talking about form and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they got named.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we see this with diesel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we've talked about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen this with ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen it with the puncher stuff where
we're just bag seed, bag seed,
[SPEAKER_07]: bag seed proliferating.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on cuts that are kind of held tight
in little crews.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bag seeds start slowly proliferate
proliferating.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I remember when this was
happening with cookies, the cookies crew
[SPEAKER_07]: kept referring to everything as fortune
cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you're lucky you got that seed in
that bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's fortune cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not real cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just fortune cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the slander of all non cookie fam
approved cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, because it was one of those
things where if it wasn't branded through
[SPEAKER_00]: them, it wasn't them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they certainly weren't going to admit
that their stuff had gotten out either.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so there's a bunch of rumors
we don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I'm some expert where I can
tell you the origins of forum exactly or
[SPEAKER_00]: OGKB and how it exactly popped up and
through where and how.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a there's a lot of,
you know, like a lot of these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of circles involved,
you know, small circles that can overlap
[SPEAKER_00]: at times, you know, and there was
definitely circles in Mendo that had
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects going on with them and those,
you know, and there was circles in the
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, some of those people
own places in both places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bay and by my area.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so as a result of that,
you know, I don't think I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: most people ever heard of like what Bud
itself, the thin mint was found in,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't think they wanted to give
up what the mom was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I'm like I said,
I'm 99 percent sure that it came out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of of cherry kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's funny?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's funny to me is like,
it's almost like that old Dutch way of
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking where Neville would put his the
lineage out because he was a breeder and
[SPEAKER_07]: he knew it would be even if you know what
the parents are, unless you had these
[SPEAKER_07]: exact clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still going to have a tough time
making a line that represents the same
[SPEAKER_07]: exact line that I'm selling seeds of,
you know, a lot of these other people,
[SPEAKER_07]: they didn't they were as deep into
breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're thinking, if you know my
recipe, you can make my food, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you know what, if you know what cut
the mom was, you can get that cut and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're halfway there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in all reality, even if you grab two
of the same cuts and reverse them,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're popping seeds, the likelihood
you're going to run into that same exact
[SPEAKER_07]: expression in your environment is very
low.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's, you know, that was years away
from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Figuring that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I know what buddy came out
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what strains were in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know if if if that those seeds were
from an S one of that of that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know if it was the the Kush hermed
onto that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do I know if the Elvis was
involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was, but no, you know,
but I know it's those three and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what what what but it came out of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I don't think and I don't
even think amongst their initial crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: they spread it out very much like a Jigga
didn't even tell the person it came from
[SPEAKER_00]: for over a year that he had found it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's how it goes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it took.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always been there's always been
intentional opaque, you know, intentional,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fog, if you will, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so looking at cookies from a just
a purely and when I talk about cookies,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to talk about not necessarily
the the thin mint because I don't think
[SPEAKER_07]: most people like I know it's out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: People have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you know, but most people experience
the forum in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I want to talk about cookies,
most people, when they think of cookies,
[SPEAKER_07]: think of the forum cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we look at that from a breeding
aspect, what I tend to see in it is purple
[SPEAKER_07]: oracle and OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason that I tend to see this is
because out of doing myself having made
[SPEAKER_07]: several different OG Kush and purple
oracle hybrids and OG Kush GDP having run
[SPEAKER_07]: a bunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I'd seen was this constant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right around the cookies expression
showing up these small yielding cushy
[SPEAKER_07]: looking purple things, you know,
slightly gassy, sometimes more great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, a lot of times when I'd see
something that looked more close to
[SPEAKER_07]: cookies, it would be more a great beat.
[SPEAKER_07]: But finding one that looked like that with
gas was really, really unique.
[SPEAKER_07]: But to me, for a long time, that's what I
thought the recipe was.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all you ever needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do think I do think Mendo perps
comes into play heavily, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, if I if I had to make like a
an under like an educated guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose, of what maybe happened is,
you know, I think that it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like parallel lines that come
back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a situation where maybe maybe
you've got something like maybe you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: something like F1 derb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever they say that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thing herms on to that thing
herms on to Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you've got F1 derb and
that herms on to GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that thing herms on to that thing
herms on to Kush again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got cherry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then something herms again and puts
seeds in cherry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got cherry and now you've
got possible ThinMid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what else you have?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got some phenotypes, homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mangled the English language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a hard time specifically on
nailing Jigga on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, but I think that I think
that all those cats were determined to be
[SPEAKER_00]: famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they saw their movie and they took
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these questions that come out
and people want to be like, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: so have you been in your basement for the
last 15 years making this?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they certainly didn't want to be like,
well, we stumbled upon it at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were getting different things from
different friends and friends were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it and we were moving weed and this was
happening and that was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got the seed seeded bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm we're a cookie fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a that's a nice way to end
that statement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boom, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so so I mean, I'm just even
trying to be fair to them like their
[SPEAKER_00]: mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was to like build, you know, they had an
idea that they could build a brand and
[SPEAKER_00]: they could get famous and they could,
you know, sell a lot of weed, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: probably in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, wow, if we control this,
we can get crazy dollar at all these clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: on the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's produce as much of it as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get top dollar everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the branding aspect came along
and IG and this came along and these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things started happening and
they started to realize that maybe there
[SPEAKER_00]: was maybe with the way things were heading
and legalization and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe they could become famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they could become rich off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, so obviously like
Berner and Jigga are well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherb is pretty well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but there's a couple other
people that aren't very well known that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably had more to do with it than
anything, at least in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't want their faces to be
shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe because they were Bay Area hustlers
at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't want they didn't,
you know, and, you know, I've said this
[SPEAKER_00]: before on the cast too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's a very different skill set
from the nineties through the two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of staying under underground and
staying with your face not visible and
[SPEAKER_00]: staying safe and then flipping into I'm
going to create a cult of personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to know my face
associated with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that the people that
wanted to stay secret aren't very well
[SPEAKER_00]: known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that wanted to stick their
face over everything and talk and be at
[SPEAKER_00]: all the events are household names in the
weed community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you want to say that,
you know, that I mean, that's how it goes
[SPEAKER_07]: in any business, not just weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's any like the front man's always going
to be the one that that gets the shine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's but it's it's
different in weed because I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a part of it where there
was risk involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and when I and when I say
hustler, it's like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there there was a lot of gray area then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people were intently not
trying to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so some people took that
route and some people took the fame route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think when they started,
you know, they started trying to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, like basically based off the fact
that they had this one cut and now they
[SPEAKER_00]: were famous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people took the route where they
tell on the black market people at local
[SPEAKER_07]: business meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we haven't gotten to gelato or sunset
sherbet yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to touch on those?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can touch on the sherb, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I think yeah, we'll start
with Sherb.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start with Sherb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that happened first, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so so Sherb supposedly by the I
didn't get to ask Sherbinski himself what
[SPEAKER_07]: Sherb, what sunset sherbet is.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said it was made in his garage during
sunsets, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was it was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: The district in San Francisco that he
lived in is called the Sunset District.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, maybe that's what he meant by Sunset
Yeah, because that was my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called if you live there and you're
from the Bay, you tell people I live in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's like a neighborhood,
you know, that like I why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's exactly why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's named after the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've seen a few different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen Burmese Kush cross to the flow
right at OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: I seen pink panties crossed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pink panties crossed across the
floor at OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've seen different things for pink
panties on what exactly pink panties is,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it's really Burmese Kush cross to
flow right at OG or it's a Burmese Kush
[SPEAKER_07]: cross to something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you run that one yet or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: The the pink panties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burmese Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you which one you're talking
about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pink panties, which is supposed to be
a Burmese Kush cross of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I it's it's it's in the stock,
but it is not made its way into the
[SPEAKER_00]: balloon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when I first got it,
I was really stoked just to kind of get a
[SPEAKER_07]: good idea of what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it reminded me a lot of a a lower
resin Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, it's not that that does not
sound had better turps.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had better turps in Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like a total knock on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see why someone would have used it for
the turps, but it wasn't super resinous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't have great bud structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't super dense.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was purple and it had a great pink
stock like pink stripes stock with purple
[SPEAKER_07]: stripes down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really pretty that way in veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I believe that's what's supposed to be
half of sunset.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm correct and the other half,
I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else remember?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I I think, you know,
I mean, I think they've acknowledged that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I think it's they say it's that
cross to thin mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thin mint and pink panties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it's all because it's like
they cookies never never really varied
[SPEAKER_00]: very far from the from the the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's part of the issue,
too, is it's not really they have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: family or a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had they started with a couple of
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, like even like gelato,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato is is, you know, Sherbert back to
thin mint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said made by reversing Sherbert hitting
the GSE.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said that originally they were
trying to reverse thin mint onto Sherb,
[SPEAKER_07]: but that failed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sherb onto thin mint worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said they tried it two different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he say if he did he say he reversed
Sherbert or did he say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said reversed Sherbert.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reversed Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_07]: Intentional reversal of Sherbert in some
in, you know, like in a typical L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: garage blown it up type thing like I've
always done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it was it was I mean,
I believe them in the sense in in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that Sherbinski had a six lighter in
the in the in the Sunset District.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jigga and various people, they were
they were looking for places to do
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, they were looking for places to like,
OK, so they have this cookies thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a bunch of loot from
selling it all over to these dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to take it in different
places and start creating seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are starting to be booming business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they worked out a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't exactly know what it was where
they brought in Sherb and they brought all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cuts over there and they start and
they used his his garage for a few times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it happened at his house,
all of a sudden he's Sherbinski.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I will say he was the he was the
one person out of everyone, because I hit
[SPEAKER_07]: up everyone for this show to see if they
wanted to leave any comments or if they'd
[SPEAKER_07]: respond about different genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the only one that was nice enough
to respond and and I'm not dissing him.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I just wanted to say for everyone
watching, he was the only one out of those
[SPEAKER_07]: dudes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice enough to respond.
[SPEAKER_07]: So take that for what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciated that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I do you know, I think he
had I mean, I think even on like his
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram stories or whatever,
he's like gone to the the Sunset District
[SPEAKER_00]: and like pointed out the house that it
started.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He you know, he had a sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a six, maybe a six or an eight
lighter or something like that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and he was buddies with
those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, you know, they started doing
some breeding work over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously they have a collab or a
partnership going or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Else and out of that collab and
partnership eventually came Sherbert,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they named Sunset Sherbert because
of the region of San Francisco it came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has another bay tie in.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always wondered that now it makes way
more sense with the sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you're not from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not you're from down in California,
desert hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the sunset is the sunset is a
beautiful district, beautiful neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: in the in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was I don't want to say it was
affordable then, but it was one of the it
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of the neighborhoods that you
could actually kind of like live in and
[SPEAKER_00]: get away with something like that for a
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's some really wealthy
neighborhoods in SF and there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: really crappy ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was like a decent one,
you know, and it borders the you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes all the way to the ocean and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a cool spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, you know, there's so yeah,
again, I think much like the second wave
[SPEAKER_00]: in Amsterdam, like like Sirius Seeds and
Luke from Paradise and those guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where like even 25, 30 years
later, they still don't want to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage hints.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, I don't think Stravinsky
or Jigga or any of those guys really wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to give out exactly what the secret sauce
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, because I don't think it benefits
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're not like they don't take that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take the much more modern aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of hide how you did it to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because they don't want anyone out
there making reproductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or trying to find the plants that they
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and as a result of that,
obviously, like the rename game is strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is pervasive throughout cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that thing that you I never saw Burmese
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not that that doesn't mean it
doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was an Adam Dunn thing that was
real popular for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has any of your friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Buku.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buku.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was popular during that time,
especially in Colorado and stuff like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it was one of the early OG Kush
crosses that people could get like MK
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultra and Burmese Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why people were running that,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people were running it back
then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because it was one of the few you
could get that supposedly had OG Kush in
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as far as I know, I could be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that the the primary Kush and
all these cookie things is that is that OG
[SPEAKER_00]: is that flow, that flow cut, because
that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was their house cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had it years before, you know,
they had it years before the whole cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: thing even started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I've heard, you know, I don't know
if I want to even speak, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it would be it would be best if it
came from Sherb probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely heard some different
things over the years as to like what
[SPEAKER_00]: could have been involved in Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even heard that Sherbert in the
beginning was a regular line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we need to have that there was that
there was that there was that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: male Sherbets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, male there was there was
maybe some male Sherbs at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think so if you reverse some
things, maybe they picked like an
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chose to take that one to back to the
thin mint again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when they when they wanted to
make gelato or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he's probably more famous for
gelato now than he is for Sherb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would think even though his name
is Sherbinski.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the gelato is kind of like we're a
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there was probably half a
dozen Finos from, you know, that that they
[SPEAKER_00]: made popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From kind of like one batch of seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty five, forty one, forty two,
thirty three.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plant seeds, you number seed one
through three hundred or one through
[SPEAKER_01]: twenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One through eighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we did about I think only like 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it worked well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I was hearing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't hear it this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifteen seeds on this phenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number 20 was just popping.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you plant seed at the end,
the 20 was just popping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if that I think that was
related to like Blanco or something later
[SPEAKER_07]: on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's always a good quote to
bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I don't I don't think,
you know, I don't think burner has ever
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember some of the early days at the
Cookie Collective when they started
[SPEAKER_07]: popping those up and people would take
pictures of like the plants in the windows
[SPEAKER_07]: because they put like display clones in
the windows.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just be covered in PM.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, dude, if this dude was a
grower, he should be able to spot that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I get his bud tenders weren't,
you know, but, dude, if you're been,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't mean this to be like a
diss at all on burner specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I mean, I just mean in the sense
that, well, because I'm not going to diss
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that pretends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I don't think I don't even
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I think burner is out
there to be a hype man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burners out there to promote a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's done a really he's he certainly
is, you know, promoted it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not too many corners of the weed
world that don't know about cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what they know about cookies might
vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but the fact but, you know,
they you know, and right now they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be like a multi state
organization or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and they're trying to be a clothing
brand and a weed store brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like the cookies brand is as
far moved beyond what our interest is is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the I don't think, you know,
they're, you know, our interest is mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: on this show is obviously genetics,
plant makeup, how plants breed,
[SPEAKER_00]: how plants smoke, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say personally, we're we're halfway
through the show or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am not that big a fan of cookie and
and cookie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've been talking about it for a
while or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I had a jar of a bunch of famous
things, you know, cookies is not what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would be reaching for very often.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had a jar of 15 things, cookies would
not be in the top 15 of things I've smoked
[SPEAKER_07]: nothing cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been cool, unique stuff I've been
able to do with it that I kind of like
[SPEAKER_07]: like the the the the cookie Barry Diesel
that ended up being the the blue cookies
[SPEAKER_07]: cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's few and far between where I'm
like, wow, this is good enough to really
[SPEAKER_07]: say it's super, super unique and worth
carrying on when it comes to cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I and that's just like that's just
my personal opinion, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's not like but I just find that
like I really like weed that burns well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of cookies is like to me,
it's too dense to like burn that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that in the looks,
I think that cookies suffered from people
[SPEAKER_00]: making mistakes, not knowing what they
were doing early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they lost the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the reasons I think OG KB
became so famous, even though it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant grows like an inch a month,
you know, it's a huge pain in the ass,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it actually worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the few cookies lines,
you know, as far as like cookies goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the ones that actually get you
stoned or maybe like, OG KB and real
[SPEAKER_00]: animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the real animal cookies gets
its buzz from the coach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's mostly OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, it's mostly it's it's like mostly
OG Kush with like some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some other elements to it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but I think a lot to me, a lot of
cookie plants and a lot of cookie hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all that the high isn't particularly
unique or potent and it doesn't last that
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got something for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: How I want you to create a line.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want you to create a line that's truly
unique in your mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to use cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to make the ultimate special
unique cookies line.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have anything at your disposal in the
clone world.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're trying to make something
unique off cookies, when I look at plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at there's very few plants to me
that have it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that in terms of like,
you know, every good trait you can think
[SPEAKER_00]: of from structure to bud size to resin
content to buzz to flavor to it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these classifications.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're breeding, you're kind
of like, well, I'm going to look at what
[SPEAKER_00]: do I like about this plant and what is it
missing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so maybe so with cookies,
I'd look at cookies and I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it grows like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like food or sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't get me that high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a bunch of cool smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly has a bunch of cool hues of
purple and different types of stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: can pop out in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bud structure is pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would try to breed it with something
that would give it from a production
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, although this wouldn't be very
necessary as far as a smoker goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a like a grower's perspective,
you would probably want to breed it with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that would give it some stretch
and some vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it could handle a little bit more
food and handle a little bit more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but from a from a consumption
perspective, I would be looking to cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it with the most potent thing I could
think of that wouldn't fuck up its overall
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_07]: See where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the sense of like I wouldn't
necessarily like cross it like with a
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, although I suppose that could
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it it it would it would probably
mess up the qualities that cookie has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be looking for something that like
packed a rare punch like like the if you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to stay cushy, you could do that 56
day headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could throw it on some you could throw
it on some Chem D, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is which is pretty and super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would be looking to inject potency
in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can be like the GMO.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good good direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: That we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's that's obviously Chem D by
cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We at least a Chem D expression by
cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they had Chem D in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It it you know, that's that's kind of what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking to add some potency to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, like if that is the case
and they did use Chem D or a derivative of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, GMO got pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it even got famous in the sense it
did something that I think is super rare,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is it got famous as a cut that takes
12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, anything in the 12 to
16 week range is really, really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: get famous because it's longer running
than most people want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think people were willing
to run GMO for that long because it dumped
[SPEAKER_00]: that it yielded like crazy and especially
when it came to hash yields and washing
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that, it dumped really
high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it made those extra three or four weeks
really valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would be looking to add potency to
cookie personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a secondary measure,
I would try to make it not grow like shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, growing in Mendo,
you know, it kind of hates the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wish I swear to God in the gorilla
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had cookie that cookie would have
done amazing in like manzanita patches and
[SPEAKER_00]: on the edge of forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I could see it would have really
done good because it's dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't it does well in low light
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I knew people early on in cookie
days that would grow one strain directly
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the light and cookie all the
way around it on the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would get really big yields per
light off that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they'd get a decent yield off like
the bright parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other aspects that were a
little like shaded or whatever that were
[SPEAKER_00]: there on the outskirts, the cookie yielded
just fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: If people are taking shots with aspect
today, they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was thinking because I remember
seeing Tom Hill's haze cross to the deep
[SPEAKER_07]: junk that he did and it actually ended up
looking like cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that haze of his crossed to cookies
might actually be really interesting and
[SPEAKER_07]: keep a lot of the beautiful form that
cookies has.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know, only he would really
know after after doing a bunch of crosses
[SPEAKER_07]: with it, if you could keep some of the
high from that haze in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm a huge haze head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I eliminated it is because
it adds this jungle element does and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could probably find something that you
really liked, but you'd better be willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the thing with haze,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a more complicated subject
in terms of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in terms of in terms of haze,
you're looking for things that make the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud nicer, make it shorter, make it take
not as long, but still keep some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz elements that you're after.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only other thing I would probably go
after would be Appalachia, just because I
[SPEAKER_07]: still think that's probably one of the
fastest, best lines out there right now
[SPEAKER_07]: for hybridizing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would be I don't know if it
would necessarily go super unique
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking in the comments and I
was like, I should hit up this guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay Cash, and ask him to message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't know that the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the whole time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I didn't know the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that that's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, I mean, I I I think I think
haze by cookie would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a deep chunk by cookie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't I do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was just a molded, like just a
horrible mold machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, whether it's from something
like Chem D or a headband or a haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what kind of buzz you're
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wouldn't do Kush specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go chems just because there's so
much Kush already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just inbreeding that has been
bred into it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd be better off going for a
different potent indica family,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because inbreeding is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what screwed cookie a
bit is is inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and not going far enough
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly haze would add a wild new
bunch of genetic genetics that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: never messed with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, really, what you're searching
for is that invisible high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot that that Phil Tiroho did some of
those crosses.
[SPEAKER_07]: He did like a bubba haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he did a cookie's haze.
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't know he haze a few different
ones that were really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone just mentioned that in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, so I I think I would I would
cross it to some kind of chem and see
[SPEAKER_00]: where it went.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I did like the chem 91
animal cookies that I ran.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty exceptional.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was reminding me of a chem 91 without
the shitty trait of eating itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it looked just like chem 91,
but a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think our our homey CSI is a
spurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly with the form cut and stuff like
that is done has certainly made some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been pretty excited about some of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed with cookie is hilarious because
it's got all the buzz you could ever want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the uglier things out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're mixing it with something that's
like really pretty and doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're sort of definitely hoping for
the looks from the cookie and the wallop
[SPEAKER_00]: from the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason why I suggested chems or
something like that is just to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing, the structure manageable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep it super Afghani like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Manable, manageable, trying to get to the
manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get distracted by comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we keep you away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's I, you know, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we we might have, you know,
that'll probably be a different episode or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But amongst the crew, you know,
we have some some of the interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of this, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought this was an interesting one,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just also along the lines of like the
Appalachia cookies would be like a C 99
[SPEAKER_07]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure someone's made that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I off the top of my head, I can't
remember who would have made that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that that I mean, I don't think it
would give you anything super unique with
[SPEAKER_07]: C 99 cookies is like, you know,
but it is Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, you like a much better
structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appalachia can kill it because you got the
KMD in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we already know what KMD and cookies
do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that actually might be a
good one because you'd have you'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and potency if you could find
the right mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really good yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could definitely increase the yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: I take down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love I love Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Mr. Sol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But C 99 is not on my bucket list of of
hazes to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get why people like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: C 99 with Hayes myself, but I don't I get
it, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just bred away from all the good parts
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's he went for chunky and quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get so much skunk one high from C 99
that I just don't like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I associate it with skunk one much more
than Hayes because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get why people would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he bred for looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickness and weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who sold there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be sly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think they I think they had a
few seeds and popped them and gave out the
[SPEAKER_07]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they bred for shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you don't believe any you don't
believe any of the cubing bullshit or
[SPEAKER_07]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, if if they're if their goal
was to cube to make a line and then bred,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hate even using the term because
it's so wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, if their goal was to make a
seed line that's uniform, then they
[SPEAKER_07]: epically failed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They epically failed to C 99 is just shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Loads of phenos.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, I have more faith that sly
could have done good breeding work as
[SPEAKER_07]: opposed to soul who was learning to breed
in or to grow and get grow tents in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado in late 2010, 11.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a lot of insight into seeing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was one of those people who
absolutely believed word for word that
[SPEAKER_07]: sold new shit until I met him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I realized, oh, my God,
who wears sly?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this guy?
[SPEAKER_07]: How'd he fucking get pushed out of the
equation?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, that's a different
subject, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is true that in the forums,
there was a number of people that got
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of the first time that
weed people could get a little famous in
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you knew what you knew about them
through what their persona you'd most most
[SPEAKER_00]: of these people didn't you didn't know
them in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, names like Vic High or or
Tom Hill or or, you know, sly or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, DJ Short or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these people are like producing
seeds and making offerings and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing their stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them got super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't know them in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I didn't even know Tom Hill was my
dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found that out later in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, rovers people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papa was a rolling stone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papa was a rolling stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papa was a rolling stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, and so it's like on
forums, especially IG is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you only know what I mean,
you only know what people present
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves as.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you start to do a show like
we do, people get, you know, dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of you chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they can form a slightly like
more nuanced opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, posts, forum posts and IG
posts and all that that can be heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: curated around an image or around a,
you know, a phantom even, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of things that you don't see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I think I think a lot of
people make very I mean, I guess that's
[SPEAKER_07]: even what I did is I was getting on the
forums I made very I made a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: assumptions about people based on how I
saw them interacting and what they were
[SPEAKER_07]: presenting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and luckily, you know, during the time
when I when I was first starting,
[SPEAKER_07]: there weren't a lot of seed makers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got to meet a lot of them in person.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when I realized how much was
smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even when I talk to people about me
and stuff in my life and what I present,
[SPEAKER_07]: everything is what I want to show.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, nobody wants to show you the
dude, you know, having trouble taking a
shot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, because he didn't need enough fiber.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, nobody wants to see that part.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all curated to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see that either.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually FaceTime not so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's, you know, there are some people
that will stun you with the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that they have about the plant
and about reading when you meet them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people that will stun you
into oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like the forest gump of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person just yeah, just stumbled
around and bumped into a bunch of cool
[SPEAKER_00]: shit along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was totally, you know, yeah,
he was completely oblivious and half aware
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just stumbling, stumbling
blindly around into one thing or another.
[SPEAKER_07]: And see, I kind of felt like that's how I
did, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't feel like I had any right to
be in the crew that I was with in San
[SPEAKER_07]: Diego or have access to the cuts that I
did early on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking back, I'm like, you know,
a lot of people spend years, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to hunt down pure push and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was just there, you know,
or a hog's breath.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was just there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think that's what a lot of this
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just knocking around, stumbling
around and hoping you don't constantly run
[SPEAKER_07]: into someone who's going to screw you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what cannabis is to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and to be fair to everyone,
I will say that while Matt and I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we there's plenty of stories
over and over and over again about how bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed rules the game and how people
accidents happen and become very famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a hard time thinking of someone
who just simply said, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got hella lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I partied all weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My room hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even read before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pissed off when it when it when it
got seeded because I was worried that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to affect my price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the most famous thing I've ever
done in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a total accident.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, one person I can think of.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he changed the story later on to be a
much like Capulator.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say Capulator.
[SPEAKER_07]: He came out first and I'm not even a
fucking breeder.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, with the Mac and after that,
the story changed, you know, as far as I
[SPEAKER_00]: went rage for three days and my light
timer went off the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came back and passed out from the
concert and took me two days to check on
[SPEAKER_00]: my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, and and and I'm so all
the accidents that have happened or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, basically,
it's like after you get famous,
[SPEAKER_00]: people start trying to add intention and
care and that they were some reclusive
[SPEAKER_00]: garage green genius care fully mixing
these things together until they finally
[SPEAKER_00]: got a product to show the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not typically how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, when you do that, you fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and and it was a bunch of
work for nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that you might not make good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, getting famous is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting famous and having a screen
take off is it's not something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: really totally control.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I rarely I mean, I don't think people
really capture lightning in a bottle twice
[SPEAKER_07]: unless they're already rich.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you're already rich and you
can put on a good marketing campaign,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can push yourself to a good spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen that with rare daintiness and
several other companies as they started
[SPEAKER_07]: brand new company, big ads in high times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're at the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, yeah, I mean, it is really hard
to to push hype on a cannabis community
[SPEAKER_07]: pre Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even if you push hype,
unless it's something that catches the
[SPEAKER_00]: public's flavor and eye anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why we see so many
strains that get hyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for six months or a year or 16 months
or something, they catch a good ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the community is like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like how many of how many things
in the last three or four years that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been hyped since things went legal,
do you think are still going to be hyped?
[SPEAKER_00]: We 10 years from now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have a resurgence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of them that got hyped and
they got a marketing machine turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it, you know, I mean,
take it's like it's hard enough and we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to have a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dis one hit wonders all you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most musicians never even get that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: One big hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That like everybody knows the song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most musicians don't get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then it's, and then most big
bands and most acts, maybe they stay
[SPEAKER_00]: together four to seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the rare ones that are together 15,
20, 25, 30, and stay relevant throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like unicorns.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I mean, even in marriages,
it's hard to put up with someone for a set
[SPEAKER_07]: amount of years and be lived that close to
them and have that many disagreements and
[SPEAKER_07]: not kill each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I watched it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's, but then there's also
staying in the public eye and the public
[SPEAKER_00]: still liking the new things that you're
doing after time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so if you want to apply that
to, to weed or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like let's, let's stay in cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't meant to be a disc to him
by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't take it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, what is your Binsky done
since Sherbin gelato?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when did those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when did those things come out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's been over 10 years,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of what Jiga and on those
guys made with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that they didn't even
actually make it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had, they, they basically have
taken under their brand, various house
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders at different times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who they all are,
but at one point it was seed junkie,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at one point it was a freaking,
what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Compound.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the fact that they hired a breeder
who couldn't even fucking grow,
[SPEAKER_07]: which means there were two middlemen
between the seed maker and the buyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is just, when you hear that,
that is just, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and you know, they've got
Kenny powers, who's actually pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's been playing around on a small level
for them in the background for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and making things for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as, you know, I mean,
you know, the last, the most famous thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that Jiga has done in the last five or six
years is probably like rip everybody off
[SPEAKER_00]: for candy rain because they didn't do a
germ test before they sold the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody found out that,
you know, basically half of them wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bunch of them were mutants.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the awesome videos I was going to
include was Kenny powers saying how he's
[SPEAKER_07]: from the streets.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he doesn't enter into any of that
genetic shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my favorite book, they,
you know, it's, it's kind of like cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, they, you see them
open in New York or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, get the band back together
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the friends are older.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got gray in their hair now,
but it all kind of, you know, catapulted
[SPEAKER_00]: them into a different world than the last
10 or 15 years than it would have
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and I think it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's an issue for you and everybody
else too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have private chats about it where in
the nineties you could have seed companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the same eight or 10 lines for
five, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt'll joke with me that if he
doesn't come out with something every
[SPEAKER_00]: eight months, people think he retired or
died.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I did that six month hiatus off
Instagram and literally people were like,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, he's done dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it doesn't take much to fall out
of the public eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then on top of that,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, so going back to like the,
the one hit wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go see some one hit wonder band at a
casino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still on tour 20 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you know, they're going to
play for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one hit that one hit going to hear
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a lot of these breeders,
and this is an issue in, this is an issue
[SPEAKER_00]: in breeding in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is, this is not to throw
shade, but typically a breeder gets famous
[SPEAKER_00]: for a specific line or a specific cut or
whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just remix that same cut
forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be the standard that that used
to be what it was standard, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cross to everything like nor Cal
IC mag or whatever it got famous for OG
[SPEAKER_00]: KB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of branching off in different
directions over time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, you know, as, as far as a few
months ago or whatever, he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more OG KB coming down the
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not dissing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like, that's
typically what happens is you,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing you get famous off of,
you start doing variations on that theme
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did that with the clockwork orange for,
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just, it seems like that is what
you like the, the typical seed company
[SPEAKER_07]: thing you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like the swamp, you know,
the swamp boys with TK, they've branched
[SPEAKER_00]: out recently and done different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering why they didn't do more
with the white.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I mean, that was like their shit and
like the Chrome's blockhead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always thought that would be cool to
bring back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I just, I just mean that like,
typically look at like dying breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles, you know, or the Skittles crew,
like what's the Skittles crew going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: next?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it going to have the same impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they going to do next?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so it's an issue with like all,
like if breeders are lucky enough that
[SPEAKER_00]: like one line gets hella famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's risky to just be like, this is
totally unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going in a totally different
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't what I'm known for at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where my interest is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made that hit eight years ago and
I'm not remixing it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in the past and you can get it
if you want, but this is the direction I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't really happen very often in
weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I, I, you know, in, in, I can just
comment on this a little bit, because when
[SPEAKER_07]: I made that decision with the clockwork,
I also had to come to the realization that
[SPEAKER_07]: it can disappear.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like maybe no one will take interest in it
after it's gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe what if it just drops and that's
that maybe, you know, but there's also the
[SPEAKER_07]: case of what if someone I don't like runs
with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our flagship.
[SPEAKER_07]: What if someone I don't like run?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all kinds of things that went
through my head at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as a breeder, when you're making
that decision, uh, to, to, to work with
[SPEAKER_07]: something that's not so popular or
something that someone else has worked
[SPEAKER_07]: with for years that you can still get,
that is a big decision to make.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to break away from, from what
sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those are all the cuts that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The not so popular ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, and that's the thing though,
is that what's funny is that if you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-commercial breeder, right,
you have total freedom to do whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can, cause you're just making it
for you and your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a commercial breeder and you
get into all that and you get into all the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging, and you get into like,
I mean, now it's kind of ending the gray
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause everybody has to be fully legal and
regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like that whole era where you're
buying a booth, you know, and you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: all this different stuff and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot of expense that goes
into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people breeding just want
to hit, they just want to get on base.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a good hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a good, they want a next,
this is my next release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you look at a lot of people's
breeding stock and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's the three things you're basing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what if you're in your thirties
and you want to still be doing it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fifties and sixties, you're just going to
have 20 or 30 years off the same basic
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: The smartest thing that anyone's ever told
me as it relates to cannabis and being a
[SPEAKER_07]: seed company was from CSI.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, never tie yourself to one
clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never ever tie yourself to one clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Said the second you do that, the second
you're locked into one clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if someone else gets that,
you're no longer important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you tied yourself to one clone,
you can't, you can't create new,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I thought that was brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a thing of like,
were you a breeder and something happened
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way that you got famous while
you were already a breeder, like say,
[SPEAKER_00]: take something like, I don't know,
you know, star dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like JJ was, you know, top dog was already
a breeder, you know, and making a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses when star dog got famous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But take something like, like Skittles or
like a lot of breeders, they get,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start breeding when they have a
famous cut that other people can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens when your whole
breeding career is based upon access?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember, you know, I can't
remember, you know, it was 10 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: now, eight years ago or something when
Skittles was first hitting the scene and
[SPEAKER_00]: we would go to Emerald cup and there would
be a line waiting to buy, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 seeds for three to $500 of Skittles
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, you know, and, and, you know,
so some of those guys became breeders at
[SPEAKER_00]: like cookie or Skittles or whatever,
when they got a famous cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, NorCal probably became,
you know, a breeder when it was like all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden OGKB was the shit and people
wanted it real bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'll be like, well, I won't give it
to you, but I'll give you hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you become a breeder to breed or
did you get ahold of something famous and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, man, I could also make money
selling seeds off this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then what do you do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your next album going to look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's why you see a lot of these
dudes scramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's like, it's the same
thing in music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how do you stay relevant over
20, 30 years?
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to keep reinventing yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the, you look at the history
of seed breeding, who's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next person that does that will be the
first.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's, who's really even over a 20 year
period, who's stayed relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to say probably, you know,
the, the one that I remember, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though people always joking me that
I'm is Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can laugh, but it's like,
you know, he started in 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in probably like in 98,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 years later or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He released mango haze, super silver haze
and nevels.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, you know, especially
counting the super silver haze that had
[SPEAKER_00]: massive impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think of somebody, think of somebody
else that like 15 years after they got
[SPEAKER_00]: famous came up with something that also
made them super famous again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard one, you know, most people are
retired or busted or, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: over it, you know, and even dealing with
the public is in that long is a huge pain
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of older breeders that I've
tried to come get back out, work with the
[SPEAKER_07]: public again, and they just want nothing
to do with it just because it's just not
[SPEAKER_07]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, they've seen what I've dealt
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've seen what other people dealt with.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been me so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like release something and I'm
like, oh yeah, that's, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff you go through and all the
things you tell me, it just sounds swell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, really swell.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're hitting the almost end of the
show.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to end it before the two hour
mark and we're right about there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think we've covered a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything else you wanted to run
into while we still have time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I guess we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we are coming close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there was, uh, there's
obviously a lot more that you could talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say we just scratched the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's Matt and I do a pretty like free
flowing, uh, where, where does the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation take us kind of style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a lot of like cultural impact
that it had.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more depth in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different things that we could
have brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because it's one of the big,
it's, you know, there's a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot to it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it we danced around, some of it we
avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it just isn't our interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt and I's interest is much
more the, the plant side of things than
[SPEAKER_00]: the, than the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some, you know, in certain aspects,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, there's, uh,
I do think that there's a lot of rumor out
[SPEAKER_00]: there about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think we dropped a few tidbits that
I'm pretty confident, uh, people will find
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I think that's neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there is a dude, uh, there's a dude
on, on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shout out for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, his name's Buckshot Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, his family's been growing for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he's trying to hunt through and
find some old, like early pearl and
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff like that, that his family
used to grow when he was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his great uncle just died this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and his great uncle is, uh,
as he said, I didn't know him,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he said he was an OG grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he was part of the Kate Wolf
Festival for a long time, which is a folk
[SPEAKER_00]: festival that the Hog Farm family throws
up at the Black Oak Ranch in Laytonville
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was part of that extended family for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently he's been growing for
decades and he just passed away at a ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: old age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, condolences to his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we are losing a lot of that first
gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, fellow outlaw growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fellow outlaw growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moment of silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have old people in your family
or community that have been growing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long time and have stories,
try to get those stories from them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once they're gone, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of our weed history is oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never know what little tidbits or
different pieces of information that might
[SPEAKER_00]: fit into a puzzle, um, are sitting in
those people's heads.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most people don't know that not so as
biggest fascination, uh, revolves around
[SPEAKER_07]: oral too, which is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is a fascination of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because, you know, uh, um,
you know, human writing is a fairly modern
[SPEAKER_00]: invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most of human history,
all history was oral.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weed history, because it was illicit
and clandestine and illegal for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, uh, wasn't exactly written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have a bunch of people getting
on camera like we are now and talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the people involved in the
sixties, seventies and eighties are still
[SPEAKER_00]: mysterious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, and they're older now,
you know, we're going to be working on
[SPEAKER_07]: some in the next coming up episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we've been doing a lot of networking
and communicating with people on the
[SPEAKER_07]: backend.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of stuff I'm really
excited to tell you guys about in the
[SPEAKER_07]: future, but I don't want to jinx it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, hopefully we'll have some cool
new shows coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, definitely go check out the site,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's east.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, um, we just did the Appalachia
drop sold out within 20 seconds,
[SPEAKER_07]: literally 20 seconds sold out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to restock those.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, uh, the, the Santa Cruz wreck,
the, the blue dream train wreck restock
[SPEAKER_07]: and, um, some smellboat stuff restock.
[SPEAKER_07]: So go check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to say anything else before we're
done?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just always happy that people give us
