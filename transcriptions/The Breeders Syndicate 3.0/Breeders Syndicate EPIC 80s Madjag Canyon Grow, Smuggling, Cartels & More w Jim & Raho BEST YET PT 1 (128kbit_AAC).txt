[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_04]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dog, Breeder and Grower from
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Matthew.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my co-host, Not-So-Dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have with us today, Madjag and
Reco.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of the episodes I've
probably been looking forward to the most
[SPEAKER_05]: since we started.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll leave it up to Madjag to kind of
start his tale, because this is one I
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't possibly begin to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Madjag, when you started getting into
growing, what was the impetus?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the start was a friend of mine who
was a dealer in Tempe, a weed dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw all kinds of loads coming through
over the years, from the late 60s to,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, 73, 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would high grade the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all seeded loads at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he had Guerrero or if he had
Oaxacan, if he found that it was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, he would keep the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, he started collecting all
these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day, around 1975,
he said, why don't we just grow our own
[SPEAKER_00]: with these seeds instead of having to deal
with this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to test that theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the very first grow in 1976 I
did with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went up and found the spot that we
would potentially use in a remote canyon
[SPEAKER_00]: along the Mogollon Rim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mogollon Rim is spelled like Mogollon,
but it's pronounced Muggion or Mogollon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the southernmost edge of the
Colorado Plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stretches roughly from Williams
Arizona all the way to Mogollon,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico, 200 miles wide, this edge of
the plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along the edge are all these cracks,
let's call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're canyons with streams,
year-round streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably, I'd say, 20 canyons with
year-round streams in that 200 miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we chose one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you decided to choose that,
was it because you knew for a fact there
[SPEAKER_05]: was no real human interaction there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just so remote that nobody was going
down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunters stay up on top of the plateau
edges and stuff, or they're way,
[SPEAKER_00]: way down in areas that are easier to,
more accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: To hike down 1,600 feet into a canyon,
down a boulder stream wash, through bushes
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, hunters wouldn't do it because
if they shoot anything, they'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just way too remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the criteria was we wanted,
it had to have a year-round stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to make sure that it was flowing
in the heart of the summer and a cheap
[SPEAKER_00]: trail dirt road that led close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wouldn't have to hike more than
maybe two hours one way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we began testing it in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have my friend who was the dealer from
Tempe walk around down below while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the rim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had walkie talkies back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just, I'd go, oh, I can see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wearing a white t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that had to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had a straw hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just can't be doing those things if you're
in the bottom of the canyon and hunters,
[SPEAKER_00]: cowboys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ranchers still use these areas back in the
early 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were grazing cows there, even though
it was national forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forest was allowing them, I think
their permits go back to the 1920s or 30s
[SPEAKER_00]: or 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just allowed them to continue on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got tighter and tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually by, let's say late
70s, they stopped all the grazing in these
[SPEAKER_00]: areas in this particular area,
which was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, that's very awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A canyon away, some guys from Jerome were
growing and they parked their truck every
[SPEAKER_00]: week, week after week after week at the
end of a Jeep trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, the rancher using that area
called the forest service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came out and ran the plates and
found, oh, wow, they're from Jerome,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hippie capital of Northern Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that blew their scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't wait for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they didn't want to go down
inside in case, you know, it would become
[SPEAKER_00]: a shootout or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they waited till they harvested it and
took it all back to Jerome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they busted on Jerome with like a
hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't have any effect on you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it bothered us because they were
within five miles by air of where we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so remote and so difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chose a canyon that was a lot better
known and people were known for hiking
[SPEAKER_00]: through it and swimming through it because
it was very long, had sections of wall to
[SPEAKER_00]: wall water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our canyon was unknown and you couldn't
hike down from the top because there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: spot we called Land, not Lands End.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hall of the Mountain King is what we
called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hundred foot waterfall and you
couldn't go down it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never had to worry about anyone
hiking downstream from where it started as
[SPEAKER_00]: a wash five miles away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how did you guys hike in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys go in a certain way that made
it accessible enough, obviously,
[SPEAKER_05]: for you guys, but other people didn't
know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drove five mile Jeep trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, well, this first time with my
friend from Tempe, it was about a three
[SPEAKER_00]: mile Jeep trail and then maybe a thousand
foot drop off down into the canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a canyon that at the top was
heavily used by swimmers and people who
[SPEAKER_00]: were into crystal clear pools and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lower part where we were,
there was no one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never left footprints either.
[SPEAKER_00]: These beautiful sandbars that are long
creeks and edges, we would just avoid them
[SPEAKER_00]: because we knew that if anyone did hike
through, that's the first place they would
[SPEAKER_00]: walk because it was easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could always check for footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our primary canyon, Madjah Canyon,
which came the next year, in five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we only saw one set of footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, my partner picked up a
hitchhiker on the way back to the nearest
[SPEAKER_00]: town and he was the guy who had hiked
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found out he was all excited because
he had hiked this 12 mile canyon and saw
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody and he had hiked right by our
gardens and never knew it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good karma meeting the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I find so interesting when I was
reading a little bit about your history
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff is how similar, although a
little bit different just due to
[SPEAKER_01]: geography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I first moved to Mendocino
County and we were doing guerrilla before
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical era really started,
was how similar the criteria was in that
[SPEAKER_01]: you were looking for somewhere very
remote, inaccessible, normal people,
[SPEAKER_01]: hikers, hunters, various people wouldn't
ever go there, but you needed water and
[SPEAKER_01]: you couldn't really take a vehicle up
there or even like dirt bikes or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: because you never wanted to leave a trail
that would have been visible from the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would only get so close and then
the rest of it was sort of hoofing it in
[SPEAKER_01]: and even hoofing it in from like different
angles so that you wouldn't create a path
[SPEAKER_01]: in summer that would be visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me interject a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they flying looking for weed then or
was that too early for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people who talked about that
going on, but we never saw that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have a helicopter land in our
canyon in the only spot that was wide
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another weird one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their tracks went about, the tracks
from the helicopter went about 400 yards
[SPEAKER_00]: down the canyon, stopped and then went
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought we were dreaming because we
didn't see the helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw these tracks and we followed
them to this little opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we got down on our knees and
looked carefully, little pieces of paint
[SPEAKER_00]: had chipped off the helicopters,
I forget what it was, the skids,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's call them, and left on the rocks
because it's volcanic rock, so it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew we were hallucinating and a
helicopter had landed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later we found out it was eagle
studyers from the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure which university,
but they were checking out all the canyons
[SPEAKER_00]: up there and getting out and hiking if
they saw eagles and trying to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers for their studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we felt okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the actual looking for plants,
if you were to clear a huge wide area and
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it open and then just start growing,
such that you could stand on the edge of a
[SPEAKER_00]: canyon and look down in and go,
hey, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to go in and out between the
bushes, make little patties that flowed
[SPEAKER_00]: from one to the next level and work it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later we even found out it made
sense because we were up on the rim
[SPEAKER_00]: looking down after watering and the
reflection on the mud was very obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: that this was an area that had gotten
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time we watered, which was once a
week, we spread oak leaves and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves were there, we started piling them
up in advance and just threw them on top
[SPEAKER_00]: and totally stopped the reflection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We painted all of our hose connections
with brown spray paint so it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never wore white t-shirts or hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this photo that you have up right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my first, my second partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my first partner in MAJAG because the
guy I started with, who's the dealer,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went separate ways kind of because he
didn't, he lived in Tempe and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't feasible for him to come up and do
this every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lived in the Verde Valley,
which I was still over an hour away,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it made more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this fellow that you see here was my
first partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in Flagg and this is what the
creek looked like year round water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pond right here is what we pumped out
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our first garden was 90 feet above the
creek level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a Briggs and Stratton,
four horsepower, two inch fire hose,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it wouldn't pump up 90 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to drop down to a garden hose
adapter that it forced it up to 90 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just barely made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was different pumps we could have
gotten for more money, like six horsepower
[SPEAKER_00]: that weighed 150 pounds or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took two hours, that first garden,
to just move the hose around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had one hose and we just move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In subsequent years, we created systems of
hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just, they all just watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those filled up little patties
and then those poured over onto the next
[SPEAKER_00]: level and to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the terrain was relatively flat on
these alluvial plateaus, but maybe a foot
[SPEAKER_00]: or two of differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus we raked it and leveled it and used
rocks to outline little patties so that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe there'd be two or three plants on
the patty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next one would be next to it
and it would drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had free hoses though, too,
that were on Siamese shutoffs and we could
[SPEAKER_00]: open them up and then, you know,
spot hit other plants and it worked pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent a lot of time developing our hose
network in subsequent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna bring in- Hey, Matt,
you know, Matt Jag, this is Raho.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, I wanna jump in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're talking about all these
gorilla tactics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this is back in the
seventies you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you were doing all this stuff,
was any of this kind of inspired by the
[SPEAKER_02]: war that we had just finished fighting in
Vietnam?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, everything that we used to
hear on the news all the time about the
[SPEAKER_02]: gorilla fighters over there and how they
concealed what they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that when I was doing my gorilla
stuff, it was, you know, I'm listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: your stories and it's exactly like what I
did, except my stuff was all green and not
[SPEAKER_02]: rock, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But where was your inspiration for these
tactics?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whore's catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The written word has always been my guide
and this is- What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Domestic Grower's Supply catalog from
1981, 1980.
Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read about this in the Whole Earth
catalog and I wrote a way for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these waterbed classical tanks to
fit in the back of your truck so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pull up to the edge of a canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew people who use this method and
it's all gravity feed downhill for 600
[SPEAKER_00]: feet to their spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a small little thing,
small little catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does have a very nice section on
pumps and these guys, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: once we started using their second catalog
in color, 1982, and they were based out
[SPEAKER_00]: of, I think, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see where this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have all kinds of guzzler pumps,
hand-operated, where you just have to put
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand in the water and that wouldn't
work for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've had a few times where things
broke and we had to water by hand using
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon jugs, dipping them in the
water and carrying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes four hours, five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't neglect it because you're
there to water and it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we did it, we were fortunate
because one week we would flood irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We estimated in subsequent years that we
were putting 20,000 gallons on our little
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this soft dirt that we used,
it would sink nice and deep and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots would follow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you couldn't go two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went like even 10 days,
which we tried to do a few times,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd come back and all the plants would
wilted and drooping or freaked out because
[SPEAKER_00]: we thought we had messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went ahead and watered the next
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was standing up perfect and
looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're amazing plants how they can be
almost shriveled and then one water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever use any water retention
crystals or anything like that to extend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was some technique that by
the time that I got to Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_01]: and started doing stuff like that,
there was already a lot of, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to call it hill tech or older
people that were passing down how to get
[SPEAKER_01]: away with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In frequent watering, it was always,
well, how do you retain the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you keep things wet when you're
only checking on things every so often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our canyon was 12 miles long and we
hiked it up and down to find the two
[SPEAKER_00]: spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first spot that's on the
camera right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other two spots we found were up
canyon and you just don't come across
[SPEAKER_00]: alluvial plateaus at water level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're up at least 20 feet above and we
had to scramble up and look and scramble
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be up in the rim and look down and
say, hey, that looks like a good spot and
[SPEAKER_00]: then go back the next week and check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we finally found our two spots,
this soil is wind deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over centuries and decades and multitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was rocks in there, big boulders as
you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this, our very first place,
down below here is where that photo was
[SPEAKER_00]: taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at almost at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the size of the coal is
sticking up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil was just this beautiful,
rich volcanic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although when Robert Clark came down in
the second year of our new location,
[SPEAKER_00]: not this one, he said he couldn't believe
we were growing in dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what do you mean in dirt?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, in Mendocino and up in
North, it's not dirt like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soil like black rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ours was brown and in gray and just
dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was easy to shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant that the water penetrated
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so did roots very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turned the soil down 18 inches,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only amendments we ever added were
bone meal and blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have to do a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the foliar spray saved us from this
twisting leaf thing that we, it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient that was missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it was molybdenum, but we sprayed
the plants and it saved our butts because
[SPEAKER_00]: they all untwisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you were, when you were,
let me ask a question in terms of when did
[SPEAKER_01]: the growing season, like when were you,
when was it nice enough outside that you
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much work did you do to prep in
the winter, spring off season?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, you turned the soil and you
had to run all these hoses and prep all
[SPEAKER_01]: this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much pregame went into like preparing
the areas you were thinking about using?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had November and December and January
off and then we were back out in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, preparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this garden here, you're looking at,
and this boat is probably 100 feet by 50
[SPEAKER_00]: feet with boulders and trees and stuff in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blended in pretty well, even from the
rim.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does blend in really well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the next garden we used was three
times the size of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, we planted in between bushes and
trees, which you'll, I'm sure you've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in some of the photos and, but when there
were no plants, those between the bushes
[SPEAKER_00]: and trees were the patties were,
I'm just calling them, that we had to
[SPEAKER_00]: build up with rocks and have it spill over
to the next garden and the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the next patty and the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had free hoses too, to be able to
walk around and, and water with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took I don't know, months of prep the
very first time, because we had to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: down so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third year we grew,
we did two gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the year that Rob Clark came
down to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he only came down to see the one
easiest to reach garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this, this photo is kind of an
early photo of that first garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are little tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here, in these, see if we can get that
first garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was that primarily different,
different types of Mexican that your
[SPEAKER_01]: dealer friend had collected?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that, was that the primary seed stock
for the first season?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you were saying stuff about
Oaxacan, I believe, and some other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any Colombian and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first year we just grew the
Mexican strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in this other canyon that
people actually went to the top of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: would swim there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our canyon, we didn't start till my
partner that you saw down there next to
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, hold it right here if you could hold
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one or this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the last photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to jump through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how they stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evergreens here were giant pines and
small shrub oak trees and bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the rim, it didn't look too,
too blocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were scattered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really knew what you were looking
for, yeah, you would have spotted this
[SPEAKER_00]: from 1600 feet above.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one really went to those edges in
those canyons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not, especially when it's 100
degrees out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just, I'd say this is one half
of this garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It extends over here and over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was only 30 feet above the creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was in a spot that you would never
expect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hiked up there and went,
holy cow, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to pump two inches of
water in a two inch fire hose up to this
[SPEAKER_00]: flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we put about 20,000 gallons
on here every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind me asking how old you were?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, 28 and 29 and 30 when we were doing
these three canyons, these three gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my partner was the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all just, you know, late 20s and
right around 30 when we started doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 76 though, I was only 25.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you still in contact with any of the
other guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're all still with us?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively speaking, the dealer from Tempe
has, what's that disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now in a wheelchair after 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, MS, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's kind of restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another partner who was the very last one
I worked with, he was a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all knew each other independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was great because we're all
originally friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has early onset Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's 70 and he has great long-term memory,
but he can't drive a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he gets in a car and starts driving,
he doesn't remember where he is within a
[SPEAKER_00]: block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my first partner that you saw there in
Madjag came down by the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's six foot seven and he's a big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still around and I see him every once
in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my partner for the last two years in
Madjag, he lives in Taos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's originally from the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: One who just wrote The Year of the Madjag.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fictional account of using all of
us and all of the characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's more about a love affair he had
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got an honorable mention in the F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott Fitzgerald competition or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is writing a second book now already.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be more factual.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pilot friend who he's in the Chronicle
I wrote called I Know the Guy Who Knows
[SPEAKER_00]: the Guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked to him a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called me because he just fell and
broke his hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to invite him to be on this
show, but he's in the hospital in
[SPEAKER_00]: Anchorage, Alaska now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bizarre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the universe didn't want that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had kind of thought he wouldn't want
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes Mr. Nice look small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go into his story later if you don't
mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I saw him physically in 1985
until last year, they were just working on
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 tons of hashish from Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the level he worked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never was busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you knew him, you'd understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I was so intent on getting
this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think, you know, we talk about a
lot of the people who have been put on a
[SPEAKER_05]: pedestal in our scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, of course, Sam the skunk man,
Rob Clark, amazing people obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: deserve their accolades.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the big heroes in the scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's some guys who did some really
big, bold stuff that don't quite get seen
[SPEAKER_05]: for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it has to do with the fact that
it was clandestine and illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's in some folks don't even still
want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some amazing stories out
there that I've come across over the
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yours was one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking to someone that you were able
to bring with you, Raho, I wanted to get
[SPEAKER_05]: into a little bit with you, Raho.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you talk about when you first started
collecting and getting into growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure, Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like so long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was just a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: 78 was the first time I smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then you had to smoke,
you know, three, four or five times before
[SPEAKER_02]: you ever actually felt the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was because the
concentration of THC wasn't so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, as high as it is today,
or maybe the stuff that kids could buy on
[SPEAKER_02]: the street back then wasn't so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, by the time I got high,
that very first time, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 15 years old after school at a
buddy's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it took a while to kick in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after I was I was actually riding my
bike home thinking, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: another time that it didn't work when it
started to hit me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a beautiful spring day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun was out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the air was just it was one of
those days where the air was crisp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the temperature was perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm cranking away on this 10
speed bike and the wind is blowing in my
[SPEAKER_02]: face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, I kind of noticed
that the the air and the light and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is just kind of alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the feeling of the wind and the air
circulating around me and in my face and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything just became you know,
it was like it was like I was connected
[SPEAKER_02]: with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I get I get home and I put
on I put on some music because I'm really
[SPEAKER_02]: cranking at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's really kicking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I drank I drank plenty
of beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, but this was nothing like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I put on these headphones
and it's Ted Nugent, Great White Buffalo.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wide open and cranked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, that's yeah,
you know, that song, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Great White Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And oh, my God, the heightened senses and
all of it going on with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old were you, Rahul?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifteen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect day for it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was listening to that, it sounds
like you had your very own bicycle day
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's what happened to Albert
Hoffman when he first took LSD is he
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got on a bike and started going
around and all of a sudden colors and
[SPEAKER_01]: wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to feel something unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They celebrate it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it bicycle day because he took
acid accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he hopped in his bike and he and
he started driving, you know, riding
[SPEAKER_01]: around and all of a sudden things started
altering on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he really wasn't sure what was
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: He thought it was the most beautiful
experience he'd ever had and wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: give it to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of similar to what you just
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that's what colors and the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were very in tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: With nature and like you're riding your
bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of triggered that for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your headspace changed and all of a sudden
the world was born anew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to share that experience or
similar.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: With with such a famous man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great story, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I mean, that was that was
the first time getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as I came down, you know,
mom and dad came home from work and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like, God, can they tell?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dinner's prepared and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, starting to reflect on
what's you know, what's what's happened to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize that, you know, the last
seven years of my life that I've been told
[SPEAKER_02]: these things in school about drugs are
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're they're evil and they'll
make you want to jump off of a building
[SPEAKER_02]: because you think you can fly or you'll be
violent or, you know, you'll immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: be addicted and fiending for more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I mean, it was just all of
a sudden I just started questioning
[SPEAKER_02]: everything I'd ever been told by the by
the authorities, you know, because they
[SPEAKER_02]: lied about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they lied about that, what else did
they lie about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, almost as every every bag of
weed that that I got after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, and, you know, never,
never been the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every bag came with seeds back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, two fingers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two fingers for a quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: One finger for a dime bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, half ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, simple math.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were plenty of seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, where I lived, you know,
in the southeast, it was mostly Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: that we saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know Madjag, you know,
they got lots of Mexican out there and he
[SPEAKER_02]: was very close to to where it came from
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, you know, buying kids buying
weed on the street, it was it was
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial Colombian most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's just loaded with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the very next year in 79, I tried to
grow my first garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I had a tray full of
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been gardening with my mom ever since
I was a little kid, you know, in the
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable garden, tomatoes and cucumbers
and watermelon and you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But growing a growing weed was just
another garden thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I I got them to sprout.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might even use the paper towel
method, you know, I mean, because after I
[SPEAKER_02]: started smoking it, I immediately
discovered High Times magazine and it
[SPEAKER_02]: became a monthly ritual of going down to
the bookstore and picking it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was at the beginning of High
Times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 76, 77, 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it had been around for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think 70 was the first year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but, you know, I took those sprouts
and I put them out in the in the bright,
[SPEAKER_02]: full sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I started them indoors under a
little fluorescent light and I put them
[SPEAKER_02]: with no hardening at all under the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went out the next day and they were
all dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the end of, you know,
year one total failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the next year I came back and I
hit it pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me and a couple of friends of mine How
are your parents with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just amazingly open minded about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at one point, maybe it was 81.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I started I started breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had picked up Rob Clark's marijuana
botany, marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just so inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, it really everything
just clicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the science of breeding and the
way that he described, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics and selection and creating
hybrids and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all so intuitive to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all just made complete and total sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I immediately wanted to make my own
seeds and start breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that meant, of course,
you know, we we wanted smoke, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we needed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed to segregate the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wound up bringing these male indica
plants into my parents house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I had these things in
the dining room, in the window,
[SPEAKER_02]: just stinking, you know, how how they put
up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom is gone now, so I can't I can't ask
her that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like, you know, obviously
he's you know, he's messing with Oaxaca
[SPEAKER_01]: and different things from Mexico,
you know, Arizona and New Mexico and that
[SPEAKER_01]: are not that much different climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in the southeast of the
United States and you're getting mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian, when you that second year where
you didn't kill your seedlings and you got
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot farther down the path, did you hit a
point where you were like, are these ever
[SPEAKER_01]: going to finish?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that second year we had a
neighbor across the street had pulled in a
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest in 79.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of one of the one of his friends had
gone to Maui for Christmas and had come
[SPEAKER_02]: back with seeds of what I know now was
Maui Waui in 79.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he grew they grew a big patch of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was it was wild leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was you know, I know today that it was
it was Mexican and some sort of Indica
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it finished early.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had amazing taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being a poor kid that cut lawns for
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, half of their crop was seeded and
they sold me the seeded stuff for cheap
[SPEAKER_02]: because nobody wanted it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back then nobody wanted seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I mean, everything was
seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you when half your crop is
seedless and they made t shirts,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that said sins and they were
they were selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see some of those today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm such a nerd for all the old
vintage shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you ever see one, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, kids immediately turn into,
you know, these instant entrepreneurs when
[SPEAKER_02]: they wind up with with, you know,
a bedroom full of weed hanging from the
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just all of a sudden,
you know, it turns into, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: all my friends are going to want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much am I going to charge for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you got lucky in the sense
that you got a hybrid that would actually
[SPEAKER_01]: finish in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always had this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm obviously like in 19 when you guys
are speaking of 1975, 77, 78, I was still
[SPEAKER_01]: happily in diapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely not my my part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always thought that like maybe the
first American breeding was you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: this import from Thailand and Colombia and
Panama and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, how the hell do I
get this to finish where I'm at?
[SPEAKER_01]: You take this Mexican and I can shorten it
up some because this Mexican seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tie in this Colombian is taking a
million years and it's getting cold and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's getting rainy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my stuff doesn't even look like it's
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that that Maui was was only
part of the crop that we did that year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was we also had a Mexican and
we had we had a couple of Colombians.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was and all my friends were
growing at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, everybody had a couple of
plants out in the woods and we'd go to a
[SPEAKER_02]: party on Friday night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's parents were out of town and
sometimes they'd walk you out behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: house and, you know, into the woods behind
their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there'd be a little six foot Colombian
Christmas tree in a in an opening in the
[SPEAKER_02]: woods behind their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just just a little hole in the
canopy where the sun came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so those Colombians,
you know, they would they would we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: we never really finished them as we know,
you know, what, you know, resin glands and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they weren't they were never
really finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't really properly finished,
but they were finished well enough that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we we could get into the end of
November and sometimes even does,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, first couple of weeks of
December where I lived before before the
[SPEAKER_02]: frost would.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the hardest part is actually,
you know, not picking it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just wanted to smoke the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I mean, we were just going
off of the the weather reports in the
[SPEAKER_02]: newspaper and sure, you know, farmers
Almanac bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe maybe I could ask a question of
both of you these first couple of years
[SPEAKER_01]: that you guys are both describing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the what were the the aromas?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the scents?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the terpene?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no one's no one used terpenes
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, what were the what did the weed
smell like to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, did it just smell like weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you did you get citrus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get any kind of skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get did you smell like weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you can remember,
what aromas were you getting off these
[SPEAKER_01]: original Mexicans and and Colombians and
these and these or even a nineteen seventy
[SPEAKER_05]: nine skunk one?
[SPEAKER_05]: What would that smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, you're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was just curious as like what what
did what Hawkins smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like did it because,
you know, we know we know these lines from
[SPEAKER_01]: like way later when they've been worked by
people extensively and bred in different
[SPEAKER_01]: directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like you guys were getting
it basically from the farmer, the source
[SPEAKER_01]: and the from unadulterated from the farmer
in the source, actual like what we would
[SPEAKER_01]: call land race today, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to go first, Matt Jagger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the very first I'll just I have a
little start up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two joints I bought were in 1966
from the only hippie in my high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I wasn't quite ready to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them in a bottle and buried them
in my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two years later, when I dug them up
and thought, I'll try them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just mold, pure mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had, you know, your really
earliest weed that I remember smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: from my friend in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I went to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pine, pine terpenes really stood out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nineteen seventy five or seventy six,
some growers weed from Santa Barbara was
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up in the Verde Valley in Sedona,
Cottonwood, Jerome area and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: coming through Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it smelled just like fresh pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smelled weed like it again
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you close your eyes and just held it
up, you would think you're you had pine
[SPEAKER_00]: soul in your in front of you like a
Christmas tree style or pine soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: More of a Christmas tree style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural pine.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was since it was strong and it was very
inspiring because when we smelled that
[SPEAKER_00]: tieweed, though, tie stick had a total
different scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was heavy and earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing early tie sticks in
1970, 71 that were supposedly dipped in
[SPEAKER_00]: opium, too, or opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Passawater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had white on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat down with some black hash ones that
was opiated, supposedly blue, black,
[SPEAKER_00]: white specks of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cut out with razor blades every
white speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had been molded so we could have
enough to take a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it made the costs go up when people
were buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid more for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've looked a lot into that situation,
especially when researching chocolate tie,
[SPEAKER_05]: because a lot of that theory behind
chocolate tie was that it was dipped in
[SPEAKER_05]: something called Passawater or Passawater,
which was the the the water that was left
[SPEAKER_05]: over from producing heroin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the alkaloids, the morphine
alkaloids and stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And supposedly the story was that they
would dip it in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's not really any proof of any of
this ever existing anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was the theory behind it and
where it kind of all stemmed from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may have happened once or twice,
but I don't know if it ever really got out
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've heard about people being charged
massive amounts of prices for these tie
[SPEAKER_05]: sticks that were supposedly dipped in this
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's been long, long debates
about that online.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you know, it's I think it's been
pretty much debunked mostly because the
[SPEAKER_02]: people growing the two different crops
weren't really the same people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them weren't producing
heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we lose track, what was the smell
that you were getting off off your
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian hybrids that you were successful
with that second year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you know, the the Mexican
versus Colombian, you know, pretty,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty distinctive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually associate cedar tastes and kind
of a kind of a citrus citrus, piney,
[SPEAKER_02]: cedary taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: With with Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew some beautiful a walk in a
couple of times that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it flowered so much faster than the
Colombian that I actually let it go too
[SPEAKER_02]: long to the point where it was it was
actually over mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had lost some of its potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but that was contrasted with the
Colombians, which were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually we'd get a lot of purple because
they'd be coming in so late that just the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature change would would bring out a
lot of purple colors in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once something turns purple,
that what's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the anthocyanins really seem to
affect the taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They always do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It affects the taste and smell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And personally, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a purple fiend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like like Madjag said,
the, you know, the pine was was there in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, you know, a difference
between the smell and the taste when you
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some of it has kind of a
chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I don't want to
completely sidetrack things into a haze
[SPEAKER_02]: talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, my my belief is when I when
I started growing O'Hays, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a few years ago, I found that the effects
one day, I just realized that the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: that I got from smoking O'Hays and even
the taste were exactly the same as what I
[SPEAKER_02]: felt that first time I got high riding
that bicycle home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that, you know,
it really kind of messed with my head a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit, because for so long,
people talked about haze as the mixture
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, four different kinds of of
sative, Mexican, Colombian, Thai and
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, trying to figure out how
this what what is obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam's the O'Hays as it's been released to
the world since since Sam brought it to
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is not everything that they that
they made when the poster was made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pedigree was described.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that's what Sam brought with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Sam preserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Sam shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: A three way Colombian hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the Indian, not the Thai, not not the
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tastes are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's kind of a chocolatey
taste to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, earthy, you could call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's piney.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find some sweetness in there,
some citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different phenos in there,
but it's all coming from Colombia as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we can have a debate and I'll
let anybody believe what they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I genuinely think like right now,
there is a man with a letter D for a name
[SPEAKER_05]: that is just smiling ear to ear when it
when it doubles old partners been talking
[SPEAKER_05]: to me and not so much specifically about
Sam's O'Hays being so Colombian dominant,
[SPEAKER_05]: being so Colombian.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the 69 Hayes was it that Neville had
gotten the first time was very much more
[SPEAKER_05]: like Southeast Asian dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the main difference between
the Hayes Neville was using and why
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville's Hayes became so popular and why
a lot of the O'Hays supposedly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the theories why O'Hays
didn't come as as much as it had promised.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminded me of something, actually,
because it had been mentioned earlier on
[SPEAKER_01]: the thing is that when, you know,
time and stuff like that was a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: broader leafed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he made a point that,
you know, Sam and those guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they kept breeding towards the thin leaf
because they thought that was more sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was actually more Colombian
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that some of the Southeast Asian stuff
and some of the ties, it's not like they
[SPEAKER_01]: were fat leafed, but they were broader
leafed than pure Colombian was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got a picture of a tie I grew
in 1981.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was a tie stick from 1980 that a
friend brought home from college,
[SPEAKER_02]: older brother of one of my partners
brought home from college and in in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very thin leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that, you know, people talk
about with tie the alligator tail leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, broad leaf, extreme serrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, it's it has a
reputation for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was, you know, it's a it's a big
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we all know from growing
that men, you can't even pack pop a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: pack of seeds without seeing, you know,
a couple of narrow weaves in there with
[SPEAKER_02]: the wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why should we think that an entire
country is going to produce nothing but
[SPEAKER_02]: the same thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, microclimate everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For for Matt and myself, you know,
when I was first started smoking,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only real two kinds of import I ever
saw was brown Mexican and green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came up a little later, the tie,
the Colombian, the, you know, the
[SPEAKER_01]: Panamanian, all some of these different
regional things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the the shift towards all those
groups, mostly importing cocaine had
[SPEAKER_01]: already happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the diversity and imports had
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was still a bunch of Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of all it was for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same experience for me, even a decade
coming in a decade, I think, after not so
[SPEAKER_05]: where I was starting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Mexican was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, talking about these Mexicans,
I'm thinking about Madjag's experience
[SPEAKER_02]: with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to can we just stick a
pin in that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make one more point about the
Hayes and the the Colombian the the
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian roots of it as we know it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, you know, Colombia, just like we
were just discussing, Thailand is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, obviously going to have a
diverse range of different different chemo
[SPEAKER_02]: type, phenotypes, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but, you know, in Colombia,
you had reds and golds and green and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, black black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so many different types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and they all had such distinctive
flavors and tastes and effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was lucky, you know,
when I started doing this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was it was the end of the glory days of
those elite those elite types of wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to smoke the Panama Colombian red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to smoke real San Amaro gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they all have things in
common.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but there were some unique
characteristics about them that just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Viva Difference, you know,
just a big, big, big fan of are the
[SPEAKER_02]: connoisseur and high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he he inspired me to become a
connoisseur of life and appreciate all the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences between things and savor them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to point this out just because
I just even a recent episode, I made a
[SPEAKER_05]: statement that I thought our was Robert
Clark, because that's kind of what people
[SPEAKER_05]: have been saying forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it's assumed that I think that might be
wrong, maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that's that's an important note
to make, because I have always associated
[SPEAKER_05]: everything Robert Clark's ever written
with are the connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love are the connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Robert Clark, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've always associated them as the
same person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Rob himself because, yeah,
long ago, I wondered the same question and
[SPEAKER_00]: he said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I've actually heard ours real name
and I can't remember it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But someone I know from Manhattan knows
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and said, oh, no, that's a different
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if he's still with us?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you'd be great when the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'm curious about, I don't want
to there's so many threads that happen in
[SPEAKER_01]: these kind of convos you could lose it at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you were describing how difficult
it was to get to your canyon grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: having done some guerrilla myself and
hidden, obviously, like growing it is one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but then harvesting it and drying
it and getting it out of there is another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you talk for a minute about what
that was like if you're going down some
[SPEAKER_01]: goat trail through the rocks and all of a
sudden you have several hundred pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be, you know, I mean,
more like a thousand pounds when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, did you try to dry it there in
the bushes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you hike it all out one by one?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much effort went into that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I that's a real struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We once we started growing in our own
canyon, in Madjag Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did everything except for that first
year where you had the photo of my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: down next to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the subsequent two years with my
partner from the UK and we had a Swiss
[SPEAKER_00]: helper, too, who I'm still good friends
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him three years ago in Zurich.
[SPEAKER_00]: He we did everything down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We manicured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dried it, manicured it, boxed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we bought knockdown boxes from a
supplier in Phoenix that were roughly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, well, for 12 inches by eight
inches by six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that held a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did, we we brought Kelty pack
frames that were just bare frames without
[SPEAKER_00]: the associated baggage on them and bungee
cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could stack five of these boxes on
one Kelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could carry out five pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every every bit was hiked out that way up
this sixteen hundred foot washed of
[SPEAKER_00]: boulders and strewn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had pruned a few branches here and
there where you just had to have clearance
[SPEAKER_00]: to get under a pine tree or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were very fortunate because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are one of the people in my life who's
still around, he was one of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: princes of peyote that I've written about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also a huge weed dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would meet us at the edge of our
canyon after sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would just hike up, hand them
however many boxes we brought up and he'd
[SPEAKER_00]: hand us a paper bag full of cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't have to even drive to
Phoenix or take the risk of trying to take
[SPEAKER_00]: it back home, because that was actually
the thought of working that hard for a
[SPEAKER_00]: year and then losing it all because you
got a traffic stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really influenced us.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one hundred dollars an ounce,
sixteen hundred a pound, and that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sold it all by grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold it for ten dollars a gram to
college students at ASU.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived two blocks away from from ASU.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just would buy everything we had and
just slowly sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a year or two and triple his money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had you had a you had a you had one
or two friends that were helping you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to hiking it out,
if you could bring about five pounds at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time, that means each trip, you're
probably at a maximum of 10 or 15 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at Harvard, we brought in six more
people at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say I was like,
man, you were really fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, your your legs, your hiking ability
was intense because it's a lot of back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've I've hiked down gasoline,
you know, five gallons of gas is like 35
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a bag of garbage bags and it
would still stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing because shaking it and
moving down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so difficult to keep it not from
saturating everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at harvest time, boyfriends and
girlfriends of ours and others,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the most we had eight people down there
manicuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we set up 10 by 10 foot Coleman classic
tents that were spray painted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were a light brown color,
but we sprayed them with a little darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: and green and they blended in very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we limbed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we cut we cut a whole plant if we
could, if it wasn't too big, we hang it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we cut the branches off,
limb them and stack them like like that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up inside these tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case it did rain, we weren't going
to get caught in, you know, with our.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, plants getting wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you do a lot of sun drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was all that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung between trees and just hung them
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was still in the 90s or 80s in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night it would drop up up where we were
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growing at about forty five
hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at night it would cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the day this, you know,
it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, we were growing in our main garden
was in an east west situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun, when it came up, it hit very
early and it went almost to the end of of
[SPEAKER_00]: the night because it did drop below the
canyon edge at each end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of our gardens was in a north
south section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only got seven hours or eight hours of
direct sunlight at max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still the plants grew perfectly and
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the east west gardens, you know,
they got 10, 11 hours of direct sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: were awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grew much bigger plants,
much taller, fuller.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did when did the Mexicans naturally
finish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when was your harvest time?
[SPEAKER_01]: When when were they ripe those first few
years for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: October.
[SPEAKER_01]: October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You passed a photo by there earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was snowing on the rim above us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a that was the north south garden
we called the Anasazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Hall of the Mountain King.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that kept hikers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colombian, the Colombian, we didn't
know about these things, about finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: and how long they would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was they were the size of my
little fingertip, you know, the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Thanksgiving and snowing above
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't grow any more Colombian after
that first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think was it by our anyway, there's this
famous there's this famous list of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been attributed to Sam or it's been
attributed to others or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had a bunch of, you know,
hazes and skunks and different things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was interesting about it is it
was organized by month that it finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was only three or four things
that finished in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was probably 10 things that finished
in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was like 25 things that
were December or January, which is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: polar opposite today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Rob was growing in Ben Loman just
above Santa Cruz in the Redwoods there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he you know, the the temperatures were
very Mediterranean in a sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to jump forward to a question
when you were talking about Mendocino and
[SPEAKER_00]: up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever do you know where Redway is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I met my Colombian friend and
future partner in many escapades.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the country tavern there in 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy from Scottsdale owned the country
tavern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also had his own chemist and he
produced millions and millions of hits of
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we went into that tavern the first
time, half the people were tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my Colombian friend, who I just met
there, he took me on a hike down towards
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelter Cove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelter Cove was was just five houses then
that were abandoned because it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: someone tried to do a subdivision there
and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we hiked down, we went off into the
woods because he knew about a few plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw my first plants over there that
were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were individual holes in between the
Redwoods, like where there was a spot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sun shooting down in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just this beautiful black,
rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their plants were, you know,
probably six or seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, wow, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's my part of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved to Mendocino County in 1998 and
I've lived there since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Southern Humboldt, Humboldt in general,
Mendocino, Lake, all those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like my stomping grounds.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like like you were saying
with LSD or whatever else, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was back then it was remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mountainous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get, you know, there wasn't very
many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your worries up there were hunters and
loggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lots of people went up there to kind
of get away from things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people grew weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people did other things, but it was
that isolation and that and that being
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of out in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how this guy from
Scottsdale found Redway, but that he
[SPEAKER_00]: bought the tavern there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was living nearby and his chemist
was somewhere nearby out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was an interesting place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where my Colombian friend was,
Gerardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was on a student visa, but he
overstayed an extra eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned English simultaneously with
Spanish in Colombia and Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since he was five years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he spoke such perfect English that
later in life, when we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our big, big bust happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was interviewed by FBI agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: He corrected their spelling twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they didn't know how to spell the
words that they were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, another thought I had,
you met, you mentioned, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Howard Marks's book, Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how your friend kind of blew him out
of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a long time ago when I read his
autobiography that he said that basically
[SPEAKER_01]: his autobiography was full of people that
had been busted and that some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: coolest and biggest people that he
interacted with had never gotten trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore you weren't going to hear
anything about them in his book because
[SPEAKER_01]: they had skated through and nobody knew
about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wasn't about to give any tips or
ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said his book was essentially a
collection of people that had gotten in
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble and that there was many who didn't
and they were invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend who broke his hip and was my
pilot friend, he never got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave my UK partner the go ahead
that he would be willing to let him write
[SPEAKER_00]: a book about him and interview him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said to him, you're going to have to
follow this guy because he's all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now he's in the hospital in
Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could probably get some weeks of
talk with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, he goes, he still goes to
Hong Kong and Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the guy is, he's 75 and he got
his pilot's license when he was 15 before
[SPEAKER_00]: he could drive a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we figured it out once he stopped
keeping a log book at 10,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that most TWA pilots never hit
10,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he literally lives in his plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he went to Alaska and bought
a gold mine, the only way to get to it was
[SPEAKER_00]: to fly in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, in Alaska, everyone uses
planes like cars, you know, if they live
[SPEAKER_00]: way out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he owned the airport once in a town
that I lived in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is just a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right, no one really knew about
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like Mr. Nice's Howard Marks friends,
because he got into Afghanistan in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was importing lapis, the deep blue
stone that's highly valued in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led to hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just sending home a few pounds
rolled up in Afghani rugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would just ship them and they would get
through back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't even using dogs really to
check stuff in the late 60s or 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then his friends slowly, you know,
moved to freighters and they were sending
[SPEAKER_00]: freighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the Soviets took over,
he couldn't go to Afghanistan any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he moved over to Peshawar in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Peshawar now is known as the terrorist
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's where all the terrorists
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peshawar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was active over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, last time I met him in 85,
he had a houseboat in Sausalito.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met him there and he was visibly
shaking because he was so excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: the 60 ton barge that they were going to
pull across the universe, which they did
[SPEAKER_00]: more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would go to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada had, he said they had only like a
thousand, not even a thousand,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few hundred agents involved in drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those West coast places above
Juneau in Alaska and that were perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in Canada along the coastline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada has much more of a hashish culture
than America did because of that
[SPEAKER_01]: importing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think not only that,
but it was like the penalties if you got
[SPEAKER_01]: caught in Canada were far less than the
American ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it reached there, it would get
him exported over to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy, he had a passport he paid
$10,000 for from the UK in like 1969 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a real passport that he was
able to have it fixed with his name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would he would walk across the
border to Canada and then fly from Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world as a British citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he was going to Afghanistan and
Pakistan, he wasn't an American.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was British.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then he'd fly back to Canada and
walk across the border into Washington and
[SPEAKER_00]: be and then go back to his normal life
over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man after my own heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also had one of the first phone
scramblers I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought it from a company in Amsterdam
and you held it up to the phone and the
[SPEAKER_00]: little rubber cups went over each end and
then you talk to the back of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was used and stuff like that,
you know, by 1970, 1971.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very security conscience, fella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very smart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so I was going to say we've kind of
wandered off the mad jag part,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's one part that like totally,
totally enthralled me with the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was about not just about the wizard
robes or any of that, because I find that
[SPEAKER_05]: so amazing, like the pictures of you guys
with the wearing the wizard robes and
[SPEAKER_05]: being very serious about all of this,
but how well you treated the land and how
[SPEAKER_05]: you respected the land and the culture
that came before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a lot of your writings,
you talk about even finding ancient,
[SPEAKER_05]: like the ancient petroglyphs, but also
some items and stuff that you guys would
[SPEAKER_05]: not take.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd leave it there because that's where
it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and and leaving nothing, not even
footprints behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was wondering if you could talk a
little bit about the spiritual aspect of
[SPEAKER_05]: Mad Jag Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we first started exploring it,
I started from the bottom up where it
[SPEAKER_00]: flowed into another canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which flowed into another canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I first met a mountain
lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a jaguar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we came up with the term, you know,
mad jag that I had come upon because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was screeching at me in the dark when I
was trying to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that canyon, when we got further up
the canyon and found these spots,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started finding boulders just covered
with pictograph, I mean, petroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 15 minutes, that rock that you had
a photo of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, I'm going to try to find those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had we had a projectile point and
all these pieces of pottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just left them there like a little
little shrine or altar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found a cave across from our
garden the first year where I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: with a tall guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this cave was a those are
Colombians there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are all the ones that's as big
as they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was close to Thanksgiving,
this photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they grew huge, but they they just
they needed to get into December in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, where's the petroglyphs here?
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we did these costumes and things
thinking that someday we would do a movie,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that's why we were doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the I still have this little
arrowhead here, but we left all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pottery behind and and we found a cave
across from near our first garden that had
[SPEAKER_00]: an arrow shaft in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a single yucca fiber moccasin that
the ancient people, you know, that made
[SPEAKER_00]: out of yucca fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like about half inch thick
and had been chewed up a lot by a rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they were obviously in this
this cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just left them there as a little
museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them all on a rock together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't made it back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to go back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we the one thing we didn't do,
which I regret, but it could still happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: was take all of our old hoses out of the
canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pump, they're still there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tucked under the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went back in the 90s and the bear had
pulled a bunch of them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we buried them and pushed them back
under.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pump got hiked out ultimately by
someone who wanted to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy was a young stallion man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just strapped that sucker on a single
pack frame in and hiked it out himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had taken it in two of us on a
pole, you know, between us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he just hiked it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's if you can get it out,
you can have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What year did that happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he knew you guys before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys told him about the pump
existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was this tall guy's mother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he he went in and he worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came down, I think, at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And helped us a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He since left the planet, though he was
much younger than all of us, but he he
[SPEAKER_00]: lived a rough and tumble life,
you know, and he.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, he didn't make it, but it's it's the
spiritual aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've slept right where he's sitting here a
few times next to the creek and listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: it flowing by at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the most fabulous thing in the and
talk about dark skies in 19, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: late 70s, the dark skies in northern
Arizona were extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Flagstaff was the nearest place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It I've I've I spent 400 days out of my
life in the bottom of this canyon and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a year of my life, and it's it's
just, you know, it became like my second
[SPEAKER_00]: home in a way I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew for five years in this canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, it's been just quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I we every once in a while I'll go back
and go out on the rim and look down in and
[SPEAKER_00]: more people are driving in four wheel
drives and razors and little four by side
[SPEAKER_00]: by side vehicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're going out on all these
jeep trails and that, but they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's down below because they're not
going to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to hike down 1600 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on a hunch and get down there and
they wouldn't find these alluvial
[SPEAKER_00]: plateaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buried, you know, so while this magical
place, yeah, 9090 feet above the creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no trail that would even remotely
bump into it, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a special place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years ago looking for this trail that
a rancher had made years ago that came
[SPEAKER_00]: down not far from this original garden and
I couldn't find the trailhead again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had grown over so much in 10 years that
when I was there last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunted all over man for hours and hours
and I know where it goes down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just couldn't find the trailhead so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a forest fire area that has still
not been reopened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a fire that was over a year and
a half ago and I'm going to go talk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: forest service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to find out why and I have a
feeling why is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about landslides or people
getting hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many architecture archaeological spots
from the trees burning and there's all
[SPEAKER_00]: this that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're afraid of people going out
there and plundering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't spots because it's very human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a canyon we wonder this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was more used and where the guys from
Jerome were using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen skulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just laying on the surface where people
had dug to bury all sites, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient burial sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sad, but it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet Raiders of the Lost Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did an article in Tempe in the early
80s about guys who would go out and just
[SPEAKER_00]: look for burial sites and dig them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow and plunder one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew and he got busted got five years in
prison because of you know ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean ancient grave robbing is something
that's been going on for a long long time
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get sold on the private market to
collectors and you know the origin of you
[SPEAKER_01]: know all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it's a shame that it happens,
but it seems like it goes on anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ancient humanity that existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Egypt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Egypt would be the Egypt would be
the one of the primary sources sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we keep this conversation could
likely go in a million different
[SPEAKER_01]: directions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think this is going to be like a
nine parter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would probably be more than just this
one part because we can't touch on
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, but one of the things I do
want to touch on is that one thing that's
[SPEAKER_01]: like really interesting to Matt and I
ourselves is that you know some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: you know we got a little off topic on haze
and you know and but some of this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: with haze and skunk one and some of these
American strains a lot of us younger folk
[SPEAKER_01]: our first like legitimate history on them
that we know of comes from when they made
[SPEAKER_01]: their way over to Holland right and that's
when they kind of became famous and
[SPEAKER_01]: started getting bread with and started
getting sold where people could hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: them and then you have people like Rob and
Sam and stuff like that who tell their
[SPEAKER_01]: story, but it's very you know with
historians or whatever it's always cool to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a different perspective from someone
you know an alternate source from the same
[SPEAKER_01]: era right and you were talking before
about how for a minute there or for a year
[SPEAKER_01]: or two you were Sam and Rob's biggest
customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right yep in the sense that you bought you
bought something like if I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly off the top of my head something
like 3,000 skunk one seeds $5,500 yeah was
[SPEAKER_00]: that 1978 or 1979 something like that you
said 79 80 and and on the back of this if
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at it up close it says that these
were bred for the 1980 in 1980 for the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1981 season do you still have this pack
yeah so you still have that yeah oh yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was telling Raho yesterday some of
the loads we got from from the cartel in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico at a certain point in 1984 roughly
82 to 84 we would get that we moved our
[SPEAKER_00]: first load so quickly that they sent us
another load that was wasn't meant for us
[SPEAKER_00]: it had labels in it from some one in
California and I've got two or three of
[SPEAKER_00]: these labels I know you'd like to have
them and I'd be glad to send I um Sam
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted them to Sam collects yeah he has
great this one this one was it was a a
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Claus in a in a wagon pulled by
horses it was in a black it's a black and
[SPEAKER_00]: white label and then we got another one a
different time there was someone else's
[SPEAKER_00]: load but because we were moving them
faster they just sent it to us and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a raccoon on the label and it was from
northern California and yeah it was it was
[SPEAKER_00]: funny but these are the art yeah these are
precious little mementos and I I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam in 1969 right out of high school
I went on seven weeks to Europe with a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend and that's the first place I tried
to get high I was at the club Paradiso and
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't I didn't smoke cigarettes so I
took a big hit of of something and I
[SPEAKER_00]: coughed my lungs I couldn't even get it in
deep enough to get it but to give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea this guy was selling a pound of of
Turkish weed for $15 it was in a shoe box
[SPEAKER_00]: a shoe box full was 15 bucks and I had no
idea huh do you think it was like he
[SPEAKER_00]: jumped his hand yeah it was probably you
know like bagweed from Turkey yeah it was
[SPEAKER_00]: dark brown it didn't look good but I
bought my first chunk of hash and I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually smuggled it back in 1969 I was
nervous as heck I didn't actually get high
[SPEAKER_00]: until later in 69 when I went to college
that was the the first time and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if I had that hash still then or not
but Denver in 1969 had everything you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Panama Red Colombian Mexican every sort of
acid you could possibly want was being
[SPEAKER_00]: sold it on the hill in Boulder so yeah all
you have to do is drive over to Boulder
[SPEAKER_00]: and hang out and was it called all the
hill back then it was just called the hill
[SPEAKER_00]: just called the hill in Boulder yeah it
was in the next is near the university but
[SPEAKER_00]: it was oh yeah and it's still really works
yeah there's a bookstore at the top where
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw Ellen Ginsburg reading the
book it was called brilliant works and to
[SPEAKER_00]: loggy on the hill is still there it's a
place where they have live music it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bar with live music I saw lightning
Hopkins there and a few other amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: people so wild yeah and it opened and I
think I have a photo of it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronicles I think in 64 it opened yeah I
mean I was really a kid then but yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: the what what channel are we on now so
when I went when I was going to Boulder in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 90s it that hill was still a place
that you could go and buy weed and acid it
[SPEAKER_01]: had transformed and it was called it was
called hippie hill nice right then and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was still a spot that you could go and
yeah you could get obviously the wheat the
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the type of weed had changed but
the ability to go there and meet someone
[SPEAKER_01]: and score a bag of weed and you know the
cops sort of tolerated it and tolerated a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of trade going on there or
whatever so it's a I didn't realize how
[SPEAKER_01]: early that had started because at that
point by the time that I had been going
[SPEAKER_01]: which was the mid 90s late 90s it would
have been on going that then for 30 some
[SPEAKER_01]: years right but what the thread we were on
is I would love to know and I'm sure Matt
[SPEAKER_01]: would too what Rob or Sam told you about
their skunk one lines like you know aside
[SPEAKER_01]: from the descriptions and stuff like that
like what they told you about what was in
[SPEAKER_01]: them or why they were excited about them
what got you excited about them to buy so
[SPEAKER_01]: many and then what your experience was
like actually growing them in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: like what they grew like what they smelled
like were they superior to the Mexicans
[SPEAKER_01]: you were growing anything like that would
be probably wonderful to chat about well I
[SPEAKER_00]: met Rob through high times he was he wrote
articles a few and yeah at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: article he always put something like if
you want to if you're interested in any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I wrote about are these seeds
you can contact me through the magazine so
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a letter to high times to Rob and
I put my phone number in there and he
[SPEAKER_00]: called me up and that's how we hooked up
because the the first year I grew skunk I
[SPEAKER_00]: had already had two years actually three
years of growing before that but the year
[SPEAKER_00]: before I made enough money that I could
afford I when I saw and heard his
[SPEAKER_00]: description and other people's of skunk
number one I just went this is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to grow something that has a
reputation and these guys are breeders in
[SPEAKER_00]: a book on botany for Christ's sake so he I
said yeah I want to get 3,000 seeds there
[SPEAKER_00]: were two bucks apiece and he knocked it
down to 175 when he flew to Phoenix
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver them to me because you're not
gonna put that in the mail back then yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I mean put 500 in the mail no so
he flew it we met at the airport Sky
[SPEAKER_00]: Harbor drove him up to Cottonwood where I
lived he stayed a few days and I gave him
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,500 in cash and he was super happy I'm
sure when he came up he had this little on
[SPEAKER_00]: the zip case that he pulled out of his
jacket and he had he had pre-rolled joints
[SPEAKER_00]: of Thai of Colombian of Oaxacan of skunk
number one and hit and he was standing
[SPEAKER_00]: there and he gave me one hit of something
I in my living room and I was laying on
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor after that and he was just
standing there talking away smoking the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the whole joint and he said oh but
you got to try this ties this time strain
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've never I my friend in Scottsdale
who I mean in Tempe who is the dealer he
[SPEAKER_00]: could smoke like that my Colombian friend
for sure he started smoking when he was
[SPEAKER_00]: seven in Cali Colombia but my friend in
Tempe he would roll ten hash joints pin
[SPEAKER_00]: joints yeah just crumbled up hash and
smoke them in a day's time in a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: degree driving a tractor that was his
motivation just chain smoke hash joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and Rob was pretty much like that so I I
don't remember him describing to me what
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk was like it was what I read in high
times that it just this skunky smell and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was going to be also have some exotic
strains in it the original skunk number
[SPEAKER_00]: one didn't have Indian you know the Kerala
India in it all it was just three
[SPEAKER_00]: countries I think right Colombian Mexican
Afghan yep it was just those three and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had smoked each of those individually but
the fact that this was a hybrid that was
[SPEAKER_00]: so potent and everything I don't know what
I had read I have all those old high times
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines I have the first high times I
have the first black belt magazine I
[SPEAKER_00]: collect all kinds of weird shit I love
that yeah and memorabilia we'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll send you some things you just
let me know but um the Afghani number one
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get a few from him as a gift I think
from buying all the skunk and it's funny
[SPEAKER_00]: because this says Afghani Hindu Kush
hashish seeds I noticed his label and yet
[SPEAKER_00]: on the back he says this is skunk number
one and I have one of these envelopes with
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani number one yeah so it's kind of
you know and he also has in letters here
[SPEAKER_05]: extra early so yeah I was reading it and
it actually is a description for a pure
[SPEAKER_05]: Afghani is what it is like the whole thing
is a description for a pure unadulterated
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani but then it says skunk one right
there these envelopes had two giant horse
[SPEAKER_00]: caps with 50 seeds in each one so they
were 100 seeds in two big gel I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose caps yeah he'd get 50 seeds in
each one and I don't know what happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: the many many of these very different
people over the years wanted one and I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave him one in my chair I think my my UK
partner still has several I don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: else to Rob came down to our garden once
and that's when he said he was amazed that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could grow out of dirt yeah you've
never seen Arizona plants I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: before and we averaged six point eight
ounces across our entire garden per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: which roughly almost a half a pound per
plant which yeah growing in the dirt yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: he said that he was used to two three four
pound plants in northern California you
[SPEAKER_00]: know up in that black soil but there's a
there's a there's a volume you know thing
[SPEAKER_01]: too and like plant numbers and so in
northern California I mean some people
[SPEAKER_01]: went crazy but a lot of times people tried
to maximize how much they could get per
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to not get you know so if they did
get in trouble in northern California it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be for less plants that was a big
thing so it's way way easier and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you get better weed growing up six or
seven or eight ounce plant versus a four
[SPEAKER_01]: or five or six pound plant but numbers did
play a role at least in northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California where I'm from well we were in
very cold water country did they what what
[SPEAKER_01]: was the type of romans that you got off
the skunk one that first year you grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very it was very skunky no you know
the smell of a skunk when you drive over
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the highway it was that exact smell
it we were we were stupefied by it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually we were when this is incredible
and it didn't smell like that growing so
[SPEAKER_00]: much but when you when it was harvested
the flowers dried and you crush you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and it was skunk smell and it was
pretty damn potent we rolled a joint once
[SPEAKER_00]: and went to this topless club called the
highlighter that we liked in Phoenix and
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the two of the dancers we went in
the ladies bathroom with two of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dancers and we each had one puff that's
all before we got busted by another dancer
[SPEAKER_00]: who came in and was in charge at night
said you guys have to get out of here all
[SPEAKER_00]: the drinks went over they fell in the
ground themselves and we were just sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there laughing they were they had never
come that high in their life and we found
[SPEAKER_00]: out later that they were scared almost I
bet but you know in 1980 or 81 there was
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we had already smoked this since
Amia from Santa Barbara that was very
[SPEAKER_00]: piney and I've and there was Thai weed
around and other things but for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason this thing packed a punch really
quite a punch and I I don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: people would rate it today compared to all
these you know chem dogs and and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other varieties that people have bred up
to 35% THC or whatever they're at now but
[SPEAKER_00]: as you know the entourage effect is what
counts the total package you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes the bioflavonoids everything
everything someone said that the test on
[SPEAKER_00]: an original Afghani I mean skunk number
one was it was only like 14% or 15% THC
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah most of the stuff I like falls in
between 8 to 18 yeah so all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients the terpenes perhaps that
skunky terpene profile and other things
[SPEAKER_05]: really added up it's really nice to have
another account that isn't from Rob or Sam
[SPEAKER_05]: about skunk one having that same smell
even back then because it's been heavily
[SPEAKER_05]: debated for a long time whether that was
true that skunk one had that smell or if
[SPEAKER_01]: it never had roadkill yeah yeah because
but the stuff that got sold in Europe it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like Rob and Sam or maybe Sam only
kept breeding away from that aroma and so
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually it became very floral very
citrus maybe a little cheese maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: grapes but people have been hunting for
that skunky smell in skunk one seeds yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: ever since and yet it seems like it
existed in the 70s and the early 80s and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it kind of went away and he maybe
they successfully bred it out of the line
[SPEAKER_01]: entirely because people have really hunted
through skunk one trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: recessives that are a throwback to what
you just described hey so I yeah I moved
[SPEAKER_02]: out to NorCal to grow for a season and it
was 1985 and when I first arrived in Ukiah
[SPEAKER_02]: I had taken a Greyhound bus and my
instructions were to meet my new partners
[SPEAKER_02]: at the laundromat which was near the
airport and the bus station I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not sure that's that part's a little fuzzy
but I'll never forget you know arriving in
[SPEAKER_02]: Ukiah getting off the bus and as I'm
walking towards the laundromat you know
[SPEAKER_02]: following the instructions I'd been given
the entire town smelled like skunk the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire town I mean everywhere I walked and
I I had to wait for a couple of hours so
[SPEAKER_02]: after a while I got bored of standing
around waiting for my buddy to drive down
[SPEAKER_02]: off the mountain and and you know pick me
up so I walked around a little bit the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole town smelled just like you know
roadkill you know people confuse the
[SPEAKER_02]: rotting flesh roadkill part with the look
when I when a skunk gets hit on the side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the road you don't smell anything but
the skunk right it's not about rotting
[SPEAKER_02]: anything yes no yeah it's just that
sulfurous you know something that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: smashed yeah yeah I live about 15 minutes
from I can be in Ukiah in about 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: from my house yeah beautiful beautiful so
you said 85 that's the part of where did
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow that first year do you remember
what part of Mendocino you grew in do you
[SPEAKER_05]: remember where you were now 1985 was the
influx like the major major influx of
[SPEAKER_05]: Indicas into that region I mean there of
course there were some you know making
[SPEAKER_05]: their way bits and pieces throughout the
70s and whatnot but 85 was like the smash
[SPEAKER_05]: year for Indicas right out in that area so
it makes sense a shitload of skunk would
[SPEAKER_02]: be in that town you know the Indicas that
I grew in in 81 and 82 were from NorCal
[SPEAKER_02]: from Ukiah and and you know the the the
towns around there and they were picked up
[SPEAKER_02]: by a friend of mine who was hitchhiking
around there for for like two years and
[SPEAKER_02]: every time he'd he'd you know get picked
up he would offer to you know would you
[SPEAKER_02]: like hey I've got some weed do you want to
smoke one and everybody always said yes
[SPEAKER_02]: but they said you know let's not smoke
yours here go in the glove compartment and
[SPEAKER_02]: let's let's smoke some of mine and he'd
pull out the bag and hear you you roll it
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll smoke it and as he rolled there
were always a few seeds in there and he'd
[SPEAKER_02]: ask him if he could keep them yeah so my
guy yeah I mean my my my first interaction
[SPEAKER_02]: with Indica was you know Christmas 81 he
came back from California to to visit and
[SPEAKER_02]: he had a collection of like six different
Afghanis and a story to go with each one
[SPEAKER_02]: like there was one that he called ranger
weed and he he'd smoked this weed with a
[SPEAKER_02]: forest ranger like and this guy had and it
was I swear it was it was what I think
[SPEAKER_02]: where Afghani number one came from it was
a very coarse you know Afghani with kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a candelabra style you know attack
there was another one he called plane weed
[SPEAKER_02]: and this was on his on his way home he he
at SFO he was walking through the parking
[SPEAKER_02]: lot and there's a guy sitting in a
Corvette convertible smoking weed right
[SPEAKER_02]: and he walked up and he gives him the look
you know and I don't know if he you know
[SPEAKER_02]: held up his finger like hey can we smoke
and the guy invited him to join him in the
[SPEAKER_02]: car and you know he got a couple of seeds
out of that encounter also that turned out
[SPEAKER_02]: to be an an f1 Thai Afghani hybrid which
was just amazing and I knew what exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what it was because I had grown pure Thai
the year before yeah right so I had these
[SPEAKER_02]: pure Afghanis and I had this I had pure
Thai the year before and this stuff was
[SPEAKER_02]: just right in the middle it was a 50-50
cross and you know I used to sit there and
[SPEAKER_02]: make notes about you know I'd sit and
smoke it and write down the the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: and the taste and compare it with other
stuff and just amazing notebooks right
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah that's amazing I do yeah that when
you first told me that you've kept these
[SPEAKER_05]: notebooks like on sense and stuff I was
like man this guy's gonna be my best
[SPEAKER_05]: friend I'm telling you this is amazing
like it's just it's it's only a certain
[SPEAKER_05]: type of people that really get this far
into weed I think and and I a lot of us
[SPEAKER_05]: think it has something to do with being on
the spectrum you know because we we get so
[SPEAKER_05]: far into something so many people are just
like it's just weed smoke it and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: like so much more one of the one of the
cool parts about doing this these chats
[SPEAKER_01]: that Matt and I do is like the realization
that like the vast majority of our history
[SPEAKER_01]: is oral right it's very little of it is
very little of it is written down you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and as people age that was evidence right
yeah yeah it was evidence and then so
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all these cool stories out there
and there's all these bits and pieces like
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt had mentioned there was great debate
like was Sam and and Rob lying about how
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky it was in the beginning and you
know because by the time they took skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: one to Amsterdam it was fruity and citrusy
and floral and all that and so you know
[SPEAKER_01]: these these stories and stuff from from
the region and what things were like is a
[SPEAKER_01]: big deal because now people look at me and
you know I'm only in my mid-40s you know
[SPEAKER_01]: but people think I'm old as fuck and like
they want to hear like my stories from the
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s but your guys stories from the 70s and
80s are like a whole generation beat
[SPEAKER_05]: before that these old mad jag notebooks
yep oh my god that's amazing and your
[SPEAKER_02]: handwriting is so much better than mine
it's just amazing that they lived through
[SPEAKER_05]: the bus I print everything yep you know
they made it through the busts like the
[SPEAKER_05]: but like when you guys did get busted they
didn't go after the notebooks and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: not so those affies came in and in like
1980 81 not 85 and I grew I grew mine in
[SPEAKER_02]: 81 and 82 and I was the only one in pretty
practice you know that anybody in I knew
[SPEAKER_02]: that had this stuff right yeah that year
the very next year all of my friends had
[SPEAKER_02]: their own AFI right that they've gotten
from different sources from wherever you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I mean 83 everybody had it it was
making its way around the country probably
[SPEAKER_02]: through deadhead you know dead toes and
stuff like that let me ask you a question
[SPEAKER_01]: about that then a lot of the old heads
have said that you know have told me that
[SPEAKER_01]: like basically like Mendocino and humble
it was almost pure sativa and people
[SPEAKER_01]: really like the buzz and the flavor and
the effect and they said one of the big
[SPEAKER_01]: things that drove Indica's popularity was
when in 81 when they started flying
[SPEAKER_01]: helicopters in my neck of the woods right
getting something that would finish in
[SPEAKER_01]: September or early October was a lot safer
than something that took till Thanksgiving
[SPEAKER_01]: and was this giant thing right yeah and so
that started spreading it because police
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure and hiding it and all that became
more important Indica's were shorter and
[SPEAKER_01]: squatter but a lot of people told me that
they didn't like the buzz as much maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you could could you talk for a minute
about your experiences versus the the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexicans and the ties and the Colombians
and all those you were growing versus like
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking Indica's at first and like what
the differences were and what your
[SPEAKER_02]: preferences were yeah you know I mean and
today what people think of as Indica
[SPEAKER_02]: usually is some sort of hybrid because the
there were pure Indica's back then that
[SPEAKER_02]: had a very sedative effect without making
your brain fuzzy right I mean it was
[SPEAKER_02]: calming yeah yeah calming and peaceful and
kind of dreamy but it didn't give you that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that that that just you know the
count what we you know couch walk is not
[SPEAKER_02]: just a body effect it's it's a stunned
mental effect right where your brain just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of seizes up you know it's like
distortion on a on a guitar right so you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to have that to have that body
effect and most of what we experience
[SPEAKER_02]: today but with that distortion with that
with that buzz comes you know it's usually
[SPEAKER_02]: got a lot of power to it right so some of
these pure affes would have would have
[SPEAKER_02]: actually been just kind of this just whoo
slows it down right peaceful very high
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing taste right just like just like
pure hash tasted exactly like hash you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and at its best right but without
that that that inability to think you
[SPEAKER_02]: might be slowed down but you could still
you know follow a train of thought and
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually get there but with and and I
think that you know skunk as it originally
[SPEAKER_02]: existed before Sam got it and and
hybridized it and used the name for the
[SPEAKER_02]: new thing that he created which was no
longer what it what it was named after
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah if anybody can follow that right
blueberries the same to me it's exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the same I want to let you finish your
thought but I'm gonna I'm gonna come back
[SPEAKER_01]: to that to a part of what you just said in
a moment but but please finish your
[SPEAKER_02]: thought so I mean you know skunk was very
um was very afghani dominant back when it
[SPEAKER_02]: first came out and it was it hits you like
like a like a sledgehammer you know
[SPEAKER_02]: mentally it just stunned you um you
couldn't think you you were just you were
[SPEAKER_02]: just seized up and I think that you know
what we um think about as afghanis these
[SPEAKER_02]: days affis indica's whatever you know the
chem line is definitely you know got
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridization going there with some kind
of skunk um which gives it you know a
[SPEAKER_02]: combination that the extra power and the
the mental kind of sledgehammer that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know a lot of people like um so
contrasting you know you you went into
[SPEAKER_02]: this with talking about what people used
to grow up there in the mountains and as
[SPEAKER_02]: you're as you were just talking about it I
was picturing Jim Richardson's book uh you
[SPEAKER_02]: know since Amelia uh flowers right and the
garden that he photographed in there and
[SPEAKER_02]: took it through the the phases of
fluorescence and documented it just so
[SPEAKER_02]: beautifully um you know I I first saw that
book in I guess 82 or 83 um my my buddy
[SPEAKER_02]: had brought it back for me and said that
it was on every coffee table in northern
[SPEAKER_05]: California it had the big sir holy weed
and Dolores and all kinds of special
[SPEAKER_05]: plants in there that weren't labeled and a
lot of people don't know that that that's
[SPEAKER_05]: the original big sir holy weed and the
trip weed and yeah I mean NorCal had had
[SPEAKER_02]: spent years you know refining these
imported sativa lines to turn them into
[SPEAKER_02]: things that would finish in the season
that they had there and and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: selective breeding for quality and and
yield and and um and finish time you know
[SPEAKER_02]: things that would work in the in the
environment you had there and it was you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you had you had created something
just as just as special as anything from
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaii right as unique and special and
those those lines I think the last thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that we you know on the market today if
somebody would go out and look for seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that they could grow that would be similar
to that or would at least give them you
[SPEAKER_02]: know a hint of what it used to be would be
if they could find a good early pearl yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: right because you can still taste the
Mexican in there and the effects still
[SPEAKER_02]: have that it's still there yes there's an
aphi thrown in there an aphi or two and
[SPEAKER_02]: the mixture of you know different sativas
but but the sweet Neville called it the
[SPEAKER_02]: awoken zing right and uh it's it's a you
know when grown as since a mill by a by a
[SPEAKER_02]: gardener who loves what he's doing you
know small numbers and pampered and cared
[SPEAKER_02]: for it's it's so tasty and delicious that
there's hardly anything that can come
[SPEAKER_05]: close yeah I'm a sucker for the silver
pearl still but um I you know I really
[SPEAKER_05]: want early girl because that's what one
that I've never ran but early pearl was a
[SPEAKER_05]: big favorite in San Diego too amazing
stuff yeah so those you know early girl
[SPEAKER_02]: and Pollyanna were you know from that that
era and from that region and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the some of those early hybrids
when when the first aphi showed up and
[SPEAKER_02]: they said well wow this is the greatest
thing ever you know can you imagine
[SPEAKER_02]: growing a couple of these things in your
garden and never seeing anything like it
[SPEAKER_02]: falling in love with the hash and the
first thing you're gonna do is you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna say I'm gonna take this new thing
which is the best thing ever and cross it
[SPEAKER_02]: with the best thing that that I've spent
the last 10 years making yeah right that's
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the first thing you're gonna do
right yep and that's what in Mendo you
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of have till Halloween or maybe the
first week of November if you get lucky um
[SPEAKER_01]: of of a good chance of reasonably good
weather and not too much rain and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: cold and the rain and the weather starts
to turn so breeding breeding and Mendo and
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt um you know you kind of have to
have some Halloween weed at the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some early November um but you
really can't like trying to push things
[SPEAKER_01]: full outside till Thanksgiving uh it gets
really dicey yeah very dicey real quick
[SPEAKER_05]: guys so we've made it through episode one
because we're already hitting the two-hour
[SPEAKER_05]: mark and it makes me stop the two hours so
I want to get in any kind of plug you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: want to get in before the end of it and I
definitely want to do an episode two if
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys are up for it next week or
whenever it's convenient for you both of
[SPEAKER_01]: you that would be amazing yeah thumbs up
yeah I've enjoyed our chatting today
[SPEAKER_01]: immensely amazing amazing actually it's
been really cool I hope that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: continue maybe even off-channel a bit
there's a million things I could talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about I'm intrigued at all of the
memorabilia for sure uh and the experience
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to drool I mean Sam used to post on
overgrown the breeders breeder on you know
[SPEAKER_01]: in the breeder segment back then in the
forums a lot of those old school uh
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and stuff like that and art that
would get made with certain kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: people's weed um and that that whole like
sort of like pre-marketing of anonymous
[SPEAKER_01]: growers was super neat um and just uh so
yeah there's a million directions we could
[SPEAKER_01]: go but as Matt said we only have four
minutes before it'll cut us off so madjag
[SPEAKER_05]: we we have you at madjag.com is there
anything else you'd like to talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: before we're uh wrapping up anywhere
people can contact you or get a hold of
[SPEAKER_00]: you or any of it what do we have here this
is beer this year's it's a smaller one um
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Santa Marta gold crossed with
Acapulco gold and it's pretty much a good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend of mine in California made the f1
and it's it's gotten good reviews what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the name for it what do you call it Jim oh
um well I had a couple people test it that
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust that smoke all day long that live
in Sedona and I said well what is it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: scale of 10 and they said 9.3 I said well
good we'll call it 9.3 that's a big name
[SPEAKER_00]: 9.3 yeah so instead of some fancy you know
airplane cookies or whatever um I love it
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah the next week have any questions you
have um you could have them ready I have
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah absolutely I did my own little free
no free screen we've covered quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a pretty free-flowing thing and so
again can head off in all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different directions and sometimes we get
to pick up on threads of things we hear
[SPEAKER_01]: and pull on that thread and hear more and
other times there's definitely things we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't pull on that I would love to uh in
the future um so and Raho do you have
