[SPEAKER_37]: I can see you!
[SPEAKER_37]: I've been wanting you!
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey, I caught a grasshopper!
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanna go meet my special friends?
Hi!
[SPEAKER_31]: Remember you can't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_16]: What you saw happened more than 50 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: The five-year-old girl followed her
brother's advice.
[SPEAKER_16]: She never told anyone about her
experience.
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, suppressed the memory deep inside
herself.
[SPEAKER_16]: But her brother Steve remembered.
[SPEAKER_25]: About ten years ago my sister called and
she told me that she just had hypnosis and
[SPEAKER_25]: was thoroughly upset with me that I didn't
tell her about my little gray friends.
[SPEAKER_25]: Which was a mystery to me because she was
there and she'd kind of taken over my
[SPEAKER_25]: friends.
[SPEAKER_25]: What is the problem here?
[SPEAKER_25]: Why doesn't she know about it?
[SPEAKER_25]: And to this day it's a total mystery why
she doesn't remember.
[SPEAKER_30]: In 1992 I was in the hospital with a very
serious illness for three months.
[SPEAKER_30]: And I went home and it took several months
for me to get back to normal.
[SPEAKER_30]: And during that period of time I started
thinking about...
[SPEAKER_30]: The next year after I was recuperating
from my illness I started thinking about
[SPEAKER_30]: UFOs and not necessarily aliens but UFOs
and I really wanted to get some
[SPEAKER_30]: information on them.
[SPEAKER_30]: I wasn't really sure why because I'd never
really been interested in them before.
[SPEAKER_30]: I'd never read anything about them.
[SPEAKER_30]: I had heard that people had been
hypnotized and found out information and I
[SPEAKER_30]: wondered maybe there was something in my
past that would have something to do with
[SPEAKER_30]: this because it just came up all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_30]: And so I went to a hypnotherapist and I
was hypnotized and it came up... I really
[SPEAKER_30]: didn't believe that I had anything.
[SPEAKER_30]: I didn't remember anything.
[SPEAKER_30]: Nobody had ever said anything.
[SPEAKER_30]: But in my hypnotherapy it came up that
when I was very small I was watching
[SPEAKER_30]: walking with my brother down by this river
and we'd seen a spacecraft and that we'd
[SPEAKER_30]: gone on board.
[SPEAKER_30]: It didn't upset me.
[SPEAKER_30]: It was very interesting to me but I didn't
really believe it.
[SPEAKER_30]: I thought it was just really my
imagination and I don't understand
[SPEAKER_30]: hypnosis and I don't know what this is all
about.
[SPEAKER_30]: So I called my brother and I said,
had this strangest thing happen and I had
[SPEAKER_30]: hypnosis and I said that I remember you
and I going down by the river and seeing
[SPEAKER_30]: these aliens in this spaceship.
[SPEAKER_30]: He says, do you remember anything?
[SPEAKER_30]: He said, well yeah, don't you remember
going and meeting our little friends?
[SPEAKER_30]: I said, no, I didn't remember anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_30]: So then he told me that as children we
used to go play with the aliens down by
[SPEAKER_30]: the river.
[SPEAKER_30]: I asked him if he knew anymore and he said
no.
[SPEAKER_30]: He didn't remember anything else but he
thought there was more and that he knew
[SPEAKER_30]: that I went with them all the time as a
child and he didn't understand why I
[SPEAKER_30]: couldn't remember.
[SPEAKER_30]: I tried but there wasn't anything in my
memory of any of that at all.
[SPEAKER_30]: So I underwent hypnosis several more
times.
[SPEAKER_30]: Some more stuff came out about aliens and
spaceships and my brother.
[SPEAKER_30]: It kind of got confusing to me because I
didn't really understand what was going
[SPEAKER_30]: on.
[SPEAKER_30]: I didn't remember why I couldn't remember
any of it.
[SPEAKER_30]: So I called some of my friends and one of
my friends, Bill, said, yeah, don't you
[SPEAKER_30]: remember the time the light came and
chased my car?
[SPEAKER_30]: I said, no, I don't remember anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't remember anybody telling me about
UFOs or anything any time.
[SPEAKER_30]: So he told me the story and then I called
a couple other friends and they said,
[SPEAKER_30]: yeah, they'd seen stuff and had different
kinds of encounters and that they
[SPEAKER_30]: remembered all of it and I didn't
remember, still didn't remember anything.
[SPEAKER_30]: Kind of in my search to find out what the
truth was for me, I decided I'd try to be
[SPEAKER_30]: a remote viewer.
[SPEAKER_30]: So in 1995, I was trained as a remote
viewer and worked as a remote viewer for
[SPEAKER_30]: four years and was very successful and
with remote viewing you can see UFOs and
[SPEAKER_30]: craft and ETs.
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think I felt at that time it was
real, but it still wasn't real to me.
[SPEAKER_30]: And about in August, it just came back and
said, like I have to tell this story.
[SPEAKER_30]: And I called my brother and my friends and
said, are you guys ready to talk about the
[SPEAKER_30]: story?
[SPEAKER_30]: And they said, yes.
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's where we are now.
[SPEAKER_25]: Remembering the incident, it's just like
we were just sitting there talking
[SPEAKER_25]: verbally.
[SPEAKER_25]: They were both the same size.
[SPEAKER_25]: They were about, oh gosh, they must have
been three and a half or four foot high.
[SPEAKER_25]: Both the same size.
[SPEAKER_25]: They had little bitty noses that may have
protruded an eighth of an inch and two
[SPEAKER_25]: little nostril holes and real thin lips
and small mouths.
[SPEAKER_25]: And their mouths would move.
[SPEAKER_25]: Their eyes didn't move.
[SPEAKER_25]: Their eyes are totally black.
[SPEAKER_25]: And their eyes go sideways.
[SPEAKER_25]: You see all these ET pictures here and
there.
[SPEAKER_25]: And the eyes go up.
[SPEAKER_25]: They slant up.
[SPEAKER_25]: These don't slant up.
[SPEAKER_25]: They go straight across, but they're all
moved.
[SPEAKER_25]: And they're big.
[SPEAKER_25]: In the last few months of kind of
discovering that every time I talk about
[SPEAKER_16]: it, boy, I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_16]: Both Linda and her brother Steve agreed to
undergo hypnosis.
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you want to see your friends?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, that's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: To see your friends.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't you push through the black space?
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_21]: Why?
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to.
[SPEAKER_21]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_21]: Push through it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Push through it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't.
I want to.
[SPEAKER_21]: You get to see your friends.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't.
I can't go.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't go.
[SPEAKER_21]: Is someone stopping you?
[SPEAKER_21]: No.
I think I just can't go.
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't go.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not afraid?
[SPEAKER_21]: No.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did anybody else meet your friends?
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you ever take your sister to meet your
friends?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, my sister went.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're doing great, Steve.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're doing great.
No.
[SPEAKER_21]: But when you took your sister,
that's your sister went?
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just go and take Peter.
[SPEAKER_21]: Every time you went, they were there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: You really seen them more than one time,
didn't you?
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: How many times?
I think so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: But they were kind.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did they smile?
[SPEAKER_21]: No.
They can't smile.
[SPEAKER_21]: How come?
[SPEAKER_21]: Little mouth.
Skinny.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why you're crying, because
you're happy.
I think so.
Yeah.
I think so.
[SPEAKER_21]: So these friends were nice to you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know what I can't talk about.
[SPEAKER_16]: Linda's hypnosis began with Robert Hudak.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't find that people can fake ab
reactions in hypnosis.
[SPEAKER_21]: An ab reaction might be something like a
cold sweat, a shake, nervousness,
[SPEAKER_21]: some kind of body movements.
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't found that to be something that
seems to be easily faked.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hudak's work was followed by sessions with
Dr. R.
[SPEAKER_16]: Leo Sprinkle.
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Leo Sprinkle.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a counseling psychologist in Laramie,
Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_17]: I served as a professor at the University
of Wyoming for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like any UFO researcher, I'm always
interested in more information,
[SPEAKER_17]: more knowledge about UFO phenomena,
about ET encounters.
[SPEAKER_17]: However, personally, because of my own UFO
experiences, I'm always impressed with the
[SPEAKER_17]: courage, the strength of character that it
takes for someone to come forward and
[SPEAKER_17]: discuss his or her experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: And anybody who does this knows that there
are not only social risks, but in some
[SPEAKER_17]: cases, there are vocational, professional
risks.
[SPEAKER_17]: And even some people are security for
their families or even their own lives.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I always am impressed whenever
people are willing to take the risk to
[SPEAKER_17]: come forward to talk about their
experience.
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of the hypnosis sessions were
monitored by a medical doctor.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been present at many hypnosis
sessions dealing with the UFO phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_12]: What interested me most was the
physiologic response of the subjects.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've witnessed racing poles, quickening of
breathing, stiffening of the body,
[SPEAKER_12]: fear, pain, and the disappearance of fear
and pain as a hypnotic suggestion.
[SPEAKER_12]: In my opinion, these physiologic effects
would not be faked.
[SPEAKER_12]: These were real experiences.
[SPEAKER_12]: The subjects were feeling pain or fear or
seeing frightful objects or happy times or
[SPEAKER_12]: real emotions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Deer Lodge, a small tight-knit community
lying in this picturesque valley in
[SPEAKER_16]: Montana.
[SPEAKER_16]: Clean place, quiet place, nice place to
live.
[SPEAKER_16]: Howdy, I'm Jim Mars.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here to tell you one of the most
fascinating stories I've encountered in my
[SPEAKER_16]: years as a journalist and author.
[SPEAKER_16]: You see, every little town has its
secrets, but this town has a secret
[SPEAKER_16]: that's, well, out of this world.
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's check it out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Linda's quest led her on a journey back to
her roots, back here to Deer Lodge,
[SPEAKER_16]: population 3,000, a relic of the mining
boom.
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of the young folks, the only concern
was how to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Linda contacted old friends and high
school chums and was amazed to find out
[SPEAKER_16]: that they, too, had had strange and
unusual experiences.
[SPEAKER_16]: Intrigued, Linda began to uncover the
town's incredible secret.
[SPEAKER_16]: Linda spoke to many of the town's folks.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some didn't want to go public,
but others agreed to speak to the camera.
[SPEAKER_23]: The ladies and their husbands were up at
an area out of town.
[SPEAKER_23]: They were snowmobiling, and when they were
coming back, no, they were at the
[SPEAKER_23]: campfire, I'm sorry, they were at the
campfire, and all of a sudden the dogs
[SPEAKER_23]: started going crazy.
[SPEAKER_23]: They heard a sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Verda Claussen, and I live here
in Deer Lodge.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were up at Orofino snowmobiling,
and Helen Schaefer was with me,
[SPEAKER_08]: and the group left us by the campfire,
and it was a black night.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were standing around the campfire by
ourselves, and we had our dog Andy,
[SPEAKER_08]: and the hair on Andy's back stood up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were in the mountains, and the men
had gone snowmobiling, and we were kind of
[SPEAKER_14]: waiting around the fire, and all of a
sudden we could hear this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we heard some noises, and they were
kind of high-pitched.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beep, beep.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beep, beep, beep.
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't a fast noise, it was just a slow
noise.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a high-pitched beep-beep kind of
sound.
[SPEAKER_14]: We all got scared.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a freaky noise, something we knew
there were no power lines.
[SPEAKER_14]: or anything up in that area, so we knew
that it couldn't be anything like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the guys said up on the top of the
mountain, they didn't see any tracks of
[SPEAKER_14]: any sort.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because people had been seeing UFOs around
at about that time.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, we were ready to go home, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was scary, and it was something that we
didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we're used to the timber and up
in the mountains and that, but this was a
[SPEAKER_14]: sound that we'd never heard before.
[SPEAKER_14]: People had talked a lot about spaceships
at that time, and we just imagined,
[SPEAKER_14]: well, maybe that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Elaine, and I'm a friend of Buck and
Helen Schaefer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Helen Schaefer is Buck's spouse.
[SPEAKER_15]: Buck is deceased, but he did tell me about
an encounter that he had.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't remember if it was morning or
evening, but he is going down the road and
[SPEAKER_15]: does see a light, just all of a sudden a
light hovering over the road.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he did stop, and it took off.
[SPEAKER_15]: He said, I know it was a UFO, I think is
how he referred to it as a UFO.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd go up in one if I had a chance.
[SPEAKER_16]: This leads to an area known as Red Gate.
[SPEAKER_16]: It used to be the favorite teen parking
spot, you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_16]: They call it Red Gate because at the
entrance was an old wooden gate,
[SPEAKER_16]: very much like this one, painted red.
[SPEAKER_16]: This was the hub of all the strange
activity.
[SPEAKER_16]: What we're talking about tonight is the
legend of Red Gate.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just tell me what you know about the
legend of Red Gate.
[SPEAKER_35]: Well, the way I had heard it from my own
dad was there was an old man, and somehow
[SPEAKER_35]: or another he had gotten in trouble.
[SPEAKER_35]: There was an involvement with some,
I think it was his sons that had gotten
[SPEAKER_35]: killed.
[SPEAKER_35]: Or were murdered on his homestead out
there just to the east of town.
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody just seemed to think it was a
possessed area, something with the devil.
[SPEAKER_23]: But nobody seemed to know the whole story
behind it or why it was supposedly
[SPEAKER_23]: possessed.
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, when we were in high school,
the exciting thing to do was to drive up
[SPEAKER_36]: to Red Gate and try to scare anybody that
you could.
[SPEAKER_36]: The story was that there was a man that
had killed his family up there some way or
[SPEAKER_36]: another.
[SPEAKER_36]: The story that I heard was that he had
painted the gate with blood.
[SPEAKER_36]: That's how the name Rygate came.
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, Red Gate was the place,
the only place that I knew of that you
[SPEAKER_36]: could go and just being in the place,
being in that place, being in the area was
[SPEAKER_36]: a very spooky, very scary place to be.
[SPEAKER_16]: As with most urban legends, the blood on
the gate story proved false.
[SPEAKER_18]: This story of the blood on the gate and
all of this stuff, I never had heard of
[SPEAKER_18]: that my whole life growing up,
that particular story.
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing I ever knew about were
these lights and everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: A check with the local sheriff showed
there was no record of such a crime.
[SPEAKER_16]: But something even stranger turned up.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Scott F.
[SPEAKER_16]: Howard, Paul County Sheriff.
[SPEAKER_33]: I have had rumors or heard that other
people in the community have had
[SPEAKER_33]: encounters with UFOs.
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that go back over a period of years?
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_33]: Most of the reports that I've heard have
been on the east side of Deer Lodge.
[SPEAKER_33]: I've heard of a spot that's been called
Red Gate on the east side of Deer Lodge.
[SPEAKER_16]: The sheriff directed me here to this
bakery owned by Louis Manacuchi.
[SPEAKER_16]: Louis and his family for many years lived
in the Red Gate area.
[SPEAKER_16]: Boy, did he have some stories to tell.
[SPEAKER_30]: Since it's in the night, what is this?
[SPEAKER_13]: All you can see is just an image of
something there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_30]: Have you ever seen the top of one?
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_30]: This is right from looking at it from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: One time during the night, one lit set
down and I climbed up the mountain behind
[SPEAKER_13]: me and I went to peek up over the top to
get a look down in there and I just about
[SPEAKER_13]: was 10 feet from the top of the mountain
and that sucker, gone.
[SPEAKER_13]: So either they had like sensors or it
could be us.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be the United States.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's what I kind of figured
that.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's water and holes such as this that
form the center of the town's social
[SPEAKER_16]: activity.
[SPEAKER_16]: As the night grows longer, so do the
stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop and go comets.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was 12 or 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd been around 90, 91 and just spotted
would look like maybe it was a meteorite
[SPEAKER_06]: or a small comet, but it didn't hang like
a comet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would move, get real bright,
kind of leave a trail and it would stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would move another direction and stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And did that, I don't know, I guess three,
four or five minutes and then took off and
[SPEAKER_06]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always watch the skies all the time and
see these lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a dead silent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, it'd make your hair stand up on
the back of your neck and we'd go out
[SPEAKER_07]: there and mess around and they'd tell the
story on the way up and there's different
[SPEAKER_07]: versions but it pretty much was the same
story with the blood on the gate and they
[SPEAKER_07]: said that people's vehicles have stalled.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we'd go and meet at town pump or at
the Safeway's parking lot, that's where
[SPEAKER_07]: all high schools kids met at, we would
say, do you guys want to go up direct?
[SPEAKER_07]: I felt a chill down my spine and I was
being watched.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know, watched or stopped or
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Danger, there was danger.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more than airing you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It even turns your stomach.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean when you get that deep feeling like
something ain't right or you're reading
[SPEAKER_07]: into somebody's psyche or whatever it is,
you could almost fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so in your gut like get out of
where you're at and you do.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some people told of interaction with
moving lights.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Denton and I grew up in Deer Lodge,
Montana about 1960-61.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're kind of riding around the car and up
near the Emory Mine, which is east of the
[SPEAKER_11]: side of town, we saw some lights.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was supposed to be one of the smart
science kids in town and at first I
[SPEAKER_11]: thought it might be a weather balloon with
a light shining off.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was not.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one day we decided we'd chase the
lights to find out what it was.
[SPEAKER_26]: We did that probably twice within a three
week period.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a light, we did chase it,
never caught it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have heard a lot of the other stories
and so one can speculate from there.
[SPEAKER_16]: At least two people remembered stories of
physical events involved with the strange
[SPEAKER_16]: lights.
[SPEAKER_16]: Tom Gilbert recalled a story from high
school.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Tom Gilbert and I've lived here
all my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I graduated in 1965 from Powell County
High School.
[SPEAKER_16]: What can you tell us about the red gate
area?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, about some light coming down and
melting the paint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we were good buddies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We worked together.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did he tell you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it seemed like the light just shined
right down on his car and there was some
[SPEAKER_16]: mark in the paint.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave Foster also remembered stories of red
gate.
[SPEAKER_18]: The story about red gate was and the story
that was related to me was these guys had
[SPEAKER_18]: been up to red gate and what they'd seen
was some lights coming down off the
[SPEAKER_18]: mountain and the lights kind of stayed
there a while and then they moved around a
[SPEAKER_18]: little bit and then they started coming at
them real fast and these two guys were
[SPEAKER_18]: with two girls and sitting out there and
it kind of scared them a little bit and
[SPEAKER_18]: the lights came at them real fast there
towards the end and it just kind of
[SPEAKER_18]: popped, went real white and then that was
it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I guess when they got back to town he
was looking at the trunk of his car and
[SPEAKER_18]: there was a little teeny burn mark right
in the back of the trunk of his car and
[SPEAKER_18]: other than that there was nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_16]: Such stories didn't end in the 1960s and
70s.
[SPEAKER_16]: They continue to this very day.
[SPEAKER_16]: Brandon Kent and Josh Garrison,
two local students, told us of their
[SPEAKER_16]: experience in the summer of 2003.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were driving along and we saw a bright
light kind of just hanging up in the sky
[SPEAKER_03]: and it confused us because there was cloud
cover and it was too bright to be a star
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was on the other side of the
clouds on our side and it just hung there
[SPEAKER_03]: for a second and then it just like zipped
down into the ground almost like it was
[SPEAKER_03]: crashing and then it was right back in the
exact same spot and it just repeated that
[SPEAKER_03]: action and then it just kind of
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't see it after it zipped down.
[SPEAKER_34]: The way back was like, man what was that?
[SPEAKER_34]: Because I mean we've never seen nothing
like that.
[SPEAKER_34]: We thought it was a falling star but
there's cloud cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it was two of them falling in the
exact same way.
[SPEAKER_34]: It looked like another one dove down and
one dove down after it lit up.
[SPEAKER_34]: But it was definitely, there was low
clouds, it was definitely low to the
[SPEAKER_34]: ground and it shot down and I'm up in that
area a lot hunting and never seen nothing
[SPEAKER_34]: like that.
[SPEAKER_34]: It wasn't a plane.
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean I'm flying planes a lot.
[SPEAKER_34]: It wasn't a plane.
[SPEAKER_34]: My dad's a pilot.
[SPEAKER_34]: I know what they look like going down.
[SPEAKER_34]: It was extremely fast.
[SPEAKER_34]: Really bright light.
[SPEAKER_34]: We've heard of some urban legends of the
red gate up above there but it's more,
[SPEAKER_34]: it was in that red gate area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost like, almost farther up the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the left hand side of the road.
[SPEAKER_34]: The east side of town up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up by the Orfino campground.
[SPEAKER_34]: Up towards the Orfino.
[SPEAKER_34]: It was right on the front side of Orfino
in front of this mountain.
[SPEAKER_34]: I've never seen nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time I'd ever seen
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that you couldn't just shake
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a satellite.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a star.
[SPEAKER_34]: I've seen some stuff in the sky but
nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_34]: Nothing beneath the clouds and it's bright
and repeating itself that fast.
[SPEAKER_34]: Dropping down within that mountain.
[SPEAKER_34]: I thought I was crazy but actually I
didn't say anything at first.
[SPEAKER_34]: I just saw it go down and then these guys
were like, whoa did you see that?
[SPEAKER_34]: It was a bright glow.
[SPEAKER_34]: Brighter than I've seen before.
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean it didn't light up the sky.
[SPEAKER_34]: It was more like seeing the sun drop down
twice.
[SPEAKER_34]: It was that bright but it didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was almost like if someone had a bright
spotlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer of 2003, just about a week
and a half ago, it's July 30th today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my friends were out up by Orfino
and we were driving out and we saw a light
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the field so we stopped and we
started looking at it and one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends is like, whoa that's moving around
and we're just like, whatever man we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started looking at it and we
all started noticing that it was moving
[SPEAKER_00]: around out in the field in kind of
roundabout ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really sure what about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at it and our passes or so and
we start driving down the road and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going pretty fast and we're all just
staring at the light in amazement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching it move like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What could it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go up and we're driving along the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost hit deer and stuff but we're not
paying attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're paying attention to the light and we
pass it and we come back and we park and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably about, I don't know, I say it was
pretty close but my friends say,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was about a mile away but I think it
was closer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light was about this big from
where we could see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like it was going around on
a rotating disc almost.
[SPEAKER_16]: There was three of them.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hoping to gather more information,
Linda turned to a once secret U.S.
[SPEAKER_16]: Army intelligence gathering process.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's called remote viewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Lynn Buchanan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Alamogordo, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the government's controlled
remote viewers for eight and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the last seven and a half years of
my time in service, I was the trainer of
[SPEAKER_02]: the unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people think that controlled remote
viewing is the equivalent of being
[SPEAKER_02]: psychic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the government wanted was a method
that could be taught to the dumbest grunt
[SPEAKER_02]: soldier and have him tell his commander
what was over the hill and where to point
[SPEAKER_02]: the guns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they started off with those people
who had natural psychic ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in the end, I know our last
viewer had just been picked at random out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the military's personnel computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people look on the internet for
remote viewing and what they find is pure
[SPEAKER_02]: psychic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Controlled remote viewing was the
scientific process that was developed in
[SPEAKER_02]: the laboratory and used by the government
and the military.
[SPEAKER_02]: In essence, the subconscious mind tends to
be very psychic, but the conscious mind is
[SPEAKER_02]: not psychic at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the controlled remote viewing
process is simply one where you set up a
[SPEAKER_02]: line of communications between the
subconscious mind and the conscious mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you can have a line of
communications where you can ask the
[SPEAKER_02]: subconscious specific questions and you
can get back specific answers from the
[SPEAKER_02]: subconscious mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the obvious question for your
purposes is whether or not this can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used to answer the UFO question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We answer questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a question about some UFO
event or some UFO landing site or some
[SPEAKER_02]: abduction, we can find out whether or not
the memory of that was false memory or
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it was an actual event and that
has happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's true, we can find out what
actually happened beyond the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: the abductee remembers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a false memory, we can find out
what happened to cause that false memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so therefore, this is actually a tool
for finding information, but you've got to
[SPEAKER_02]: remember that we go by the database.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had many individuals within the
government who asked us about UFO
[SPEAKER_02]: questions and we wound up doing a good
amount of UFO work on our own for
[SPEAKER_02]: questions which were asked us by
individuals within the government and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was unofficial tasking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am picking my words very closely
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government never officially tasked us
with any UFO questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we do a lot of UFO work?
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a sizable amount and actually wound
up still doing it, sometimes for
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals within the government.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Diane Moore and I am a
professional remote viewer.
[SPEAKER_09]: In 1995, I was trained by a retired
military remote viewer in controlled
[SPEAKER_09]: remote viewing and then in early 1996,
I was trained in scientific remote
[SPEAKER_09]: viewing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Dee Leslie.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a trained professional remote viewer
and I'm director of instruction with
[SPEAKER_10]: Farsight Institute which is a
not-for-profit organization.
[SPEAKER_09]: A double-blind remote viewing session is a
session wherein the viewer just not only
[SPEAKER_09]: has no clue what the target is,
but the person who is monitoring them has
[SPEAKER_09]: no idea what the target is either.
[SPEAKER_09]: So your viewer and your monitor are not
front-loaded at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing the monitor has are the two
four-digit coordinates.
[SPEAKER_09]: In this particular project, the
coordinates were given by someone else
[SPEAKER_09]: that did not know what the target was.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone involved in the viewing of these
targets had no idea or had no information
[SPEAKER_09]: about the target.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting raised features.
[SPEAKER_09]: P4.5.
[SPEAKER_09]: The one who's in control.
[SPEAKER_09]: P4.5.
[SPEAKER_09]: The one who understands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go meet my special friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm deducting telepathy.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I look at this as an encounter between
children and an ET.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was not any fear.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a casual encounter.
[SPEAKER_10]: These subjects are gray, rubbery texture
to skin with large, heavy head.
[SPEAKER_16]: As an additional guard against any
possible fakery connected to such
[SPEAKER_16]: accounts, some of the major witnesses in
the Redgate case were submitted to a
[SPEAKER_16]: polygraph examination.
[SPEAKER_16]: No.
[SPEAKER_16]: The lie detector showed no evidence of
deception by anyone.
No.
[SPEAKER_16]: Bill Kelly, a classmate of Linda
Krenquist, told him an experience he had
[SPEAKER_16]: as a young teenager driving late at night
with two friends along this very road.
[SPEAKER_24]: We were leaving Deer Lodge after a dance
and coming home.
[SPEAKER_24]: Down the back road.
[SPEAKER_24]: We went around the corner heading down the
back road and a bright light appeared in
[SPEAKER_24]: the rear view mirror.
[SPEAKER_24]: It got very bright, very fast.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's kind of where it all started.
[SPEAKER_24]: And this was in 1962?
[SPEAKER_24]: 1962, summer of.
[SPEAKER_24]: I was with my brother Jack and a friend
Kenny.
[SPEAKER_24]: And immediately they looked in the back
and it was coming at such a high rate of
[SPEAKER_24]: speed that we couldn't explain what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_24]: So they just jumped in the back seat and
kind of panicked a little bit and kind of
[SPEAKER_24]: yelling at me to speed up and stuff,
but it got so bright.
[SPEAKER_24]: You couldn't see the road to drive fast or
to drive at all.
[SPEAKER_24]: As fast as it got bright, it got dark
again.
[SPEAKER_24]: And kind of in a state of semi-fear.
[SPEAKER_38]: My name is Ron Kelly.
[SPEAKER_38]: Many years ago when we were growing up,
my brothers Bill and Jack, I can remember
[SPEAKER_38]: them very specifically telling me about
being out at night and being out on the
[SPEAKER_38]: county road and the lights coming behind
them.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know Billy Kelly well.
[SPEAKER_18]: There was him and a couple other guys and
there was light following their car.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let yourself go back to the experience,
driving along.
[SPEAKER_17]: The light is so bright and you're not sure
what it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: But let everything slow down in your
perception.
[SPEAKER_17]: Your mind is able to be aware of what the
body is experiencing.
[SPEAKER_17]: What does the body experience?
[SPEAKER_24]: Like light.
[SPEAKER_24]: They're in the back seat.
[SPEAKER_24]: Every time?
[SPEAKER_24]: In the front seat.
[SPEAKER_24]: I had to drive.
[SPEAKER_24]: I had to drive.
[SPEAKER_24]: I might get affected with this thing.
[SPEAKER_24]: This thing looks bad.
[SPEAKER_29]: Is there somebody following us?
[SPEAKER_29]: Who the hell would be out here this time
of night?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but they're coming up fast.
[SPEAKER_29]: Nothing's really moving.
[SPEAKER_29]: We got to go, Bill.
[SPEAKER_29]: We got to go.
[SPEAKER_29]: Speed up, Bill.
[SPEAKER_29]: Speed up.
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_29]: I got to keep her on the road.
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_29]: Damn, that thing's bright.
[SPEAKER_29]: What the hell is that thing?
[SPEAKER_29]: Go faster, Bill.
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_29]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_29]: Bill, you got to go.
[SPEAKER_29]: I got to keep her on the road.
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_29]: You got to go.
[SPEAKER_29]: What the hell is it?
[SPEAKER_29]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't get that thing.
[SPEAKER_29]: Bill!
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't stop, Bill.
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't look at it.
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't stop, Bill.
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't stop.
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: We got to get home.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_23]: Man, look at the size of that thing.
[SPEAKER_23]: This is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_23]: This isn't good.
[SPEAKER_23]: This isn't good.
But
[SPEAKER_24]: it's not good.
[SPEAKER_24]: It hurts to see.
[SPEAKER_10]: P4 and a half.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are three subjects.
[SPEAKER_10]: Male.
[SPEAKER_10]: Humans.
[SPEAKER_10]: Athletic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Electro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Magnetic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Energy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pulsing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I've got a sketch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what we have.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, and I've got the subject.
[SPEAKER_10]: And another one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Strange.
[SPEAKER_10]: And another one here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it's some kind of a tube-like thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Such unworldly experiences didn't end with
just Linda's friends.
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever it was seemed to move through
families, including her own.
[SPEAKER_19]: My name's Doug Kroonquist.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was born in 1946.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I called Ear Lodge home.
[SPEAKER_19]: It would have to be between probably 50
and 52, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_19]: If I was born in 46, 50 would make me
four.
[SPEAKER_19]: 52 would make me six years old.
[SPEAKER_19]: Somewhere in there that there was a witch
that was standing on me.
[SPEAKER_19]: But I was scared and terrified and
whatnot, but I was underfoot.
[SPEAKER_19]: I was being stood on.
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's all I remember is just being
stood on by this witch.
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably had no idea what else to call it.
[SPEAKER_19]: In Montana, 1950, we didn't really even
have Buck Rogers.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was a city thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't have things like that.
[SPEAKER_19]: We had cowboys and Indians, and we had
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't have Buck Rogers.
[SPEAKER_19]: That was things that were strange to us.
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember asking my brother several
times, and to the point where he was mad
[SPEAKER_19]: at me, Steve, what's a skyscraper?
[SPEAKER_19]: My wife and I went to Area 51.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was in August of 1994.
[SPEAKER_19]: That night, it was just starting to get
dark, and it was extremely, not loud,
[SPEAKER_19]: but bright flash off to our right,
which would be over towards the Rachel
[SPEAKER_19]: direction over that way, which I would say
right now would be north.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure as to my compass points,
but off to our right, north.
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a huge, bright flash, but no sound.
[SPEAKER_19]: And later in the evening, we'd seen lights
just zipping across the sky or whatever.
[SPEAKER_16]: During a visit back to Montana some years
ago, Linda's own son had an unusual
[SPEAKER_16]: daytime experience.
[SPEAKER_22]: Back in the early 80s, I was 12 or 13
years old, and I accompanied my mother to
[SPEAKER_22]: Deer Lodge, Montana for a class reunion.
[SPEAKER_22]: My sister and I both went with her.
[SPEAKER_22]: During this time, we were out playing
volleyball.
[SPEAKER_22]: You hit it like a girl.
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_22]: It was very astonishing to me to see such
a thing.
[SPEAKER_22]: At first, I thought it was a toy.
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you see that?
[SPEAKER_22]: I turned around to my sister, and I said,
did you see that?
[SPEAKER_22]: Where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_22]: And as soon as I turned around,
it was gone.
[SPEAKER_22]: After that time, my sister and I never
really spoke about it, never really had
[SPEAKER_22]: any discussions about it, just random
recollection.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was so clear that I was thinking if it
was a toy, then how can it be that big and
[SPEAKER_22]: be so far away?
[SPEAKER_22]: Must be really big.
[SPEAKER_22]: What did it look like?
[SPEAKER_22]: The gray, grayish metallic.
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't shiny.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was dull.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it slanted up.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was round.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it slanted up from the sides.
[SPEAKER_22]: I kind of went in and had another little
top on top of it.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if there's vents on the
bottom, circular fan things.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I turned them back to her,
and I said, I think we just saw a UFO.
[SPEAKER_22]: That was really weird.
[SPEAKER_22]: She's like, yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: P4 and a half.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's scenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: To be a male and female subjects.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're human.
[SPEAKER_09]: P4 and a half.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an object slash structure behind
and above the subjects.
[SPEAKER_09]: P4 and a half.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are non-human subjects in the
object.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in this session, what I picked up
were male and female.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're engaged in some sort of
outdoor activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they see something in the sky
that's behind them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's high above them.
[SPEAKER_09]: What happens is that they see a spaceship.
[SPEAKER_16]: Linda's son said a few years later,
he had an experience that was even more
[SPEAKER_16]: disturbing.
[SPEAKER_22]: There was one occasion specifically that I
recall where I was lying in bed.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I was in that type of sleep that was
not really asleep, but not really awake.
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw this black.
[SPEAKER_22]: Shadowy figure coming towards me on the
right side of my bed.
[SPEAKER_22]: The figure itself wasn't scary at all.
[SPEAKER_22]: But it was scary, the fact that it was
advancing towards me.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it felt like it was coming towards me
to touch me and to reach out and grab me.
[SPEAKER_22]: It had a squarish type head, if you want
to call it.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the rest of it didn't look like some
sort of human shape.
[SPEAKER_10]: A small, human, blonde.
[SPEAKER_10]: P4 and a half, small, blonde, human on
rectangular surface in dark area.
[SPEAKER_10]: This human has some type of
electromagnetic field around him.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, this seems to be an event that's
repeated.
[SPEAKER_10]: P4 and a half, this nocturnal event is one
that repeats.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, other beings.
[SPEAKER_10]: Curious, off-world, intelligent,
[SPEAKER_10]: data gathering, short, and P4 and a half,
several entities, non-human, from another
[SPEAKER_10]: dimension.
[SPEAKER_10]: No relationship or concept of time,
space.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
Summary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, basically this is a repeated type
of event involving non-humans.
[SPEAKER_10]: They come from off-world.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no abduction.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some type of poking at the
subject.
[SPEAKER_10]: The subject has electromagnetic field
above his head and feels nauseous.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this seems to happen mainly at night.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's some type of black fuzziness
associated with this event.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it seems to be indoors in a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_16]: She met with her brother Steve in Deer
Lodge recently, and they took me along as
[SPEAKER_16]: they retraced their steps to the place
where they had visited with their little
[SPEAKER_16]: gray friends.
[SPEAKER_16]: As the hot day grew on, their memories
came flooding back.
[SPEAKER_25]: They came to find some way out of the
country, kind of hillbilly kids that would
[SPEAKER_25]: never be afraid of them.
[SPEAKER_25]: They're just light gray little guys.
[SPEAKER_25]: They're just standing there, and we're
standing right here, looking at them,
[SPEAKER_25]: and we're talking.
[SPEAKER_25]: And they're looking at the river,
and you guys see them all the time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Were you using your mouth?
[SPEAKER_16]: Talking to them with your mouth?
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_16]: Were they talking to you with their
mouths?
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, gosh, no.
[SPEAKER_25]: No.
[SPEAKER_25]: They weren't.
[SPEAKER_25]: No.
[SPEAKER_25]: They'd move their mouth a little bit,
but they didn't use their mouth.
[SPEAKER_25]: They'd move it a little.
[SPEAKER_16]: Were you getting words or pictures?
[SPEAKER_25]: Words.
[SPEAKER_25]: Nope, no pictures.
[SPEAKER_25]: Words.
[SPEAKER_25]: And she'd just chatter and chatter.
[SPEAKER_25]: If I remember right, she's standing on
this side.
[SPEAKER_25]: Just chip, chip, chip to my friends.
[SPEAKER_16]: The strange events surrounding Red Gate
continued right on through Linda
[SPEAKER_16]: Kroonquist's immediate family and into her
extended family.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm here today with her cousin,
Stephanie Tush.
[SPEAKER_16]: Stephanie, do you recall any stories
within your family of strange lights or
[SPEAKER_16]: strange events?
[SPEAKER_05]: My aunt and uncle were living up in the
mountains, and she got up late one night
[SPEAKER_05]: to get a glass of water, and she looked
outside and saw this bright light.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she went to the window to look out,
and she saw this, what she described as a
[SPEAKER_05]: football-shaped golden-colored globe out
in the field, out in the pasture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she stood and watched it for a little
bit, and then she called for my uncle and
[SPEAKER_05]: told him to come out and look.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got up and went out, and they went out
on their front porch and stood there and
[SPEAKER_05]: watched it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it stayed, and then all of a sudden it
took off into the air and hovered for a
[SPEAKER_05]: few minutes, and then was just gone.
[SPEAKER_20]: My aunt, Audrey Bird, mentioned that one
early morning she was alarmed.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't remember the particulars there.
[SPEAKER_20]: There was something out there in the hay
field, a light mechanism of, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: multi-lights that I remember they were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_27]: Key!
[SPEAKER_27]: Key!
[SPEAKER_22]: Covers the whole pasture.
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: My aunt nor my uncle were the type just to
say these things, and to me, I was
[SPEAKER_05]: convinced.
[SPEAKER_20]: She said she saw it, and she saw it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Couple outside, standing,
[SPEAKER_10]: wondering, questioning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, what I seem to have here is a couple
standing outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're kind of looking around and saying,
what's that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you see that?
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just draw what I'm seeing here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I have some sort of oval object.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got a line and a bunch of little
squares around the outside of it,
[SPEAKER_10]: and some of them are dark.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and this is over an open outside
area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seems dark or hard to see.
[SPEAKER_24]: Quiet, like I couldn't see you good even
when we got home.
[SPEAKER_21]: So even after you got home, you couldn't
see good?
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't afraid.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: What about the other guys?
[SPEAKER_21]: Were they afraid?
[SPEAKER_21]: No.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody talked about nothing.
[SPEAKER_21]: But I know I have.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know you what?
[SPEAKER_21]: I've seen them many times.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you know you've seen them many times?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Lots.
[SPEAKER_21]: Lots of times.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you miss them?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: How many times did you meet your friends?
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_21]: It was more than once, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_25]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_21]: But they were always nice to you?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: They were never mean to you?
[SPEAKER_21]: No.
[SPEAKER_21]: They never hurt you?
[SPEAKER_21]: No.
[SPEAKER_21]: So they were kind to you?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did they ever take you anywhere?
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I have some special glasses here.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have some special glasses that you can
see through great.
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you like me to put those on?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's put the glasses on you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see if that can help you see through
the gray.
[SPEAKER_21]: I turn black.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Would you like to talk to them again?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: You like them, don't you?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: They were nice to you?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: They were your friends?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Could it be that you miss them since they
haven't been talking to you?
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did they talk to you?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: What did they say?
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_21]: They were always friendly?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Were they just as friendly to your sister?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: So she liked them, too?
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_21]: How did you communicate with them?
[SPEAKER_21]: Telepathy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Telepathy?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_21]: So they'd think about something and you'd
put it inside your mind?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like that?
No, I heard it.
I heard it.
I could hear it.
[SPEAKER_21]: You could hear it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: What makes you cry?
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did they ever tell you not to tell anybody
about them?
No.
[SPEAKER_25]: When I took my sister, then we were there
just a very short time and she started
[SPEAKER_25]: talking and talking and talking and
monopolized the whole conversation.
[SPEAKER_25]: It was almost like she'd known them a long
time also, except she hadn't.
[SPEAKER_25]: That was her very first time.
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't remember any other time meeting
them, but about three weeks after that,
[SPEAKER_25]: my sister came up and said, oh,
by the way, I've been seeing your friends.
[SPEAKER_25]: I said, what?
[SPEAKER_25]: You went without me?
[SPEAKER_25]: And I was just thoroughly disgusted that
she would actually take over my friends
[SPEAKER_25]: and go see them by herself.
[SPEAKER_25]: And I just assumed that maybe it was that
day or the day before, but now it had been
[SPEAKER_25]: more than one time.
[SPEAKER_25]: And she just had no need to tell me.
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, by the way, Steve, I saw your friends
again.
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_30]: It's just when I get to that part,
I just can't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't want to be crying on their phone.
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: What they were there for was up in that
basin where they would land a lot of times
[SPEAKER_13]: up in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Me and the children have walked up there
before.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the only thing that I've ever seen up
there missing is bull courts, like taken
[SPEAKER_13]: out of the mud, you know, out of the dry
soil where there's been courts taken out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know, there's no car,
you know, car tracks up there or anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: So where did they go to?
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you talking about quartz?
[SPEAKER_13]: Quartz, bull quartz.
[SPEAKER_13]: Crystal quartz.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a rock.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and it's got like the red veins in
it, you know, kind of reddish.
[SPEAKER_13]: They call it rose quartz.
[SPEAKER_13]: We always call it bull quartz because it's
laying in an area where there's no other
[SPEAKER_13]: rocks.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a big sand basin with the rocks
in it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you drive into that area?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you could.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Garrel's built a house in that basin
now, and he works at the hospital in
[SPEAKER_13]: Anaconda.
[SPEAKER_30]: Now you said that they landed in there all
the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: They did there for like about three years.
[SPEAKER_30]: You want to tell them about that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they were coming and going in and
out of there for these crafts.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, they changed models.
[SPEAKER_13]: The first ones that came were red,
blue, yellow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Red, blue, yellow.
[SPEAKER_13]: Red, blue, yellow.
[SPEAKER_13]: All the way around.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then the newer model came red,
blue, yellow, white.
[SPEAKER_13]: Red, blue, yellow, white.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because on the bottom of them,
they have a light that goes all the way
[SPEAKER_13]: around it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The size of them, you can't believe.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you think of a UFO being small,
but they're quite large.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say
[SPEAKER_13]: at least 75 yards across, at least.
[SPEAKER_13]: Bigger than that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God, yes.
[SPEAKER_30]: Like a football field size?
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that big.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, maybe width-wise.
[SPEAKER_30]: Did they have windows or did they spin or
make noise?
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing that I could hear.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing that I could hear, but the dogs
could hear something because they would
[SPEAKER_13]: cower.
[SPEAKER_28]: My name's Richard Slater, and I live in
Missoula, Montana.
[SPEAKER_28]: I grew up in the Deer Lodge Valley.
[SPEAKER_28]: An incident happened to me in 1962 that I
do remember was unlike this.
[SPEAKER_28]: A friend and I had double dated,
and we were at a place called Quake Lake,
[SPEAKER_28]: which was the result of a earthquake.
[SPEAKER_28]: And all of a sudden, the radio went off.
[SPEAKER_28]: The music went off.
[SPEAKER_27]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_27]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_28]: And all of a sudden, the radio came back
on.
[SPEAKER_28]: As soon as the radio went off,
the thing that I remember most about it
[SPEAKER_28]: was, that made it unique to me,
was the stillness, vacuum of noise,
[SPEAKER_28]: if you will, that was around us.
[SPEAKER_24]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a sound, anyway.
[SPEAKER_28]: It was just still.
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually scared, and we just sat there.
[SPEAKER_31]: I want to go home.
[SPEAKER_31]: Me, too.
[SPEAKER_28]: And the radio came back on, and we left.
[SPEAKER_17]: We sort out, not only in terms of the
questions, but the possible answers.
[SPEAKER_17]: For example, many people wonder about
implants, the so-called medical
[SPEAKER_17]: examinations that occur on board.
[SPEAKER_17]: Many people report not only encountering
various ETs, but also feeling that they
[SPEAKER_17]: are themselves on board.
[SPEAKER_16]: One amazing story told by a man with deer
lodge connections involved an eerie
[SPEAKER_16]: neon-like grid that appeared in his
bedroom late one night.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the morning, the man noticed a blood
spot on his underwear.
[SPEAKER_16]: The medical doctor stated it came from a
small needle-sized puncture wound in his
[SPEAKER_16]: scrotum.
[SPEAKER_16]: There was no explanation for the cause of
the wound.
[SPEAKER_16]: Linda's adventures into the unknown
apparently did not end with a visit to her
[SPEAKER_16]: brother's little gray friends.
[SPEAKER_16]: Linda came to understand that she had made
these visits on several different
[SPEAKER_16]: occasions.
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't move.
[SPEAKER_30]: You're not my friend.
[SPEAKER_30]: They approached me with some very unusual
instruments that probed my eyes,
[SPEAKER_30]: my nose, my mouth, and my ears.
[SPEAKER_30]: They didn't hurt me, but it scared me just
because of the instruments.
[SPEAKER_31]: Please stop it.
[SPEAKER_30]: Don't poke me.
[SPEAKER_30]: As I was laying on the table being probed
by these instruments, this other entity
[SPEAKER_30]: appeared.
[SPEAKER_30]: She was different than the others and
appeared to me to be a female,
[SPEAKER_30]: and she also appeared to be somewhat
superior in authority to the others.
[SPEAKER_31]: I like you.
[SPEAKER_31]: You're different.
[SPEAKER_31]: You're a lady, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_31]: You're a lady grasshopper.
[SPEAKER_31]: I can hear you, but you're not talking.
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, I'll be good.
[SPEAKER_30]: At five years old, the entity that I
encountered looked very much like a
[SPEAKER_30]: grasshopper, and that's why I called her
the grasshopper lady.
[SPEAKER_30]: And I hadn't seen a praying mantis until I
was approximately 20 years old because we
[SPEAKER_30]: just didn't have them in Montana.
[SPEAKER_30]: So that was my only thought of what it
could be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, female.
[SPEAKER_10]: Child.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an entity.
[SPEAKER_10]: Large.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unusual.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three, four and a half.
[SPEAKER_10]: This subject with small child is like a
large praying mantis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to call this the praying
mantis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Being.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, two, four and a half.
[SPEAKER_10]: Elongated.
[SPEAKER_10]: Head.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a football.
[SPEAKER_10]: With one and more narrow and slightly
square.
[SPEAKER_10]: Body.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is very long and thin with unusual angles.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: Blend with subject.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, blending with the subject.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very gentle, nurturing,
caring, and peaceful entity.
[SPEAKER_10]: One and a half.
[SPEAKER_10]: The girl likes this entity.
[SPEAKER_16]: Another experience left Linda with
tangible and painful evidence.
[SPEAKER_30]: When I was about eight years old,
I remember going to school, and my teacher
[SPEAKER_30]: asked me what the marks were on my arms,
and I don't remember why.
[SPEAKER_30]: She just saw the ones on my arms,
but said I didn't know, and she sent me to
[SPEAKER_30]: the principal and to the nurse,
and then called my parents.
[SPEAKER_30]: And my mother came to the school,
and she didn't know how they'd gotten
[SPEAKER_30]: there.
[SPEAKER_30]: And what they were were bright red,
raised, weeping, blister, sore things.
[SPEAKER_30]: But they were really raised, and it was
really interesting because they went just
[SPEAKER_30]: right around here.
[SPEAKER_30]: They're about four inches long,
about two inches wide on the back of my
[SPEAKER_30]: arms, all the way from my elbows to my
wrists.
[SPEAKER_30]: Palms in my hands, both hands,
but on both arms.
[SPEAKER_30]: When these sores appeared, they were
extremely painful at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_30]: and they would be like blisters,
and they would be here.
[SPEAKER_30]: They were big, and then they would pop,
and then the fluid would run all over my
[SPEAKER_30]: arms.
[SPEAKER_30]: And I would have to wear things to keep
this from running all over everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: Under hypnosis, Linda told of metal
devices being placed on her arms,
[SPEAKER_16]: legs, and face.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this time, there was no grasshopper
lady to intervene.
[SPEAKER_31]: I can't move.
[SPEAKER_31]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_31]: Ow.
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't like you.
[SPEAKER_31]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_31]: I can hear all of you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Once again, she found herself lying on a
hard metallic table in a dark place,
[SPEAKER_16]: surrounded by shadowy figures.
[SPEAKER_37]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_37]: I can hear you saying.
[SPEAKER_16]: But these seemed different from the beings
she had encountered before.
[SPEAKER_16]: Mobile.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have entities.
[SPEAKER_10]: Many.
[SPEAKER_10]: Small.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gray.
[SPEAKER_10]: Non-human.
[SPEAKER_10]: P4.5.
[SPEAKER_10]: Small.
[SPEAKER_10]: Female.
[SPEAKER_10]: Childlike.
[SPEAKER_10]: Surrounded by non-humans.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gray and short.
[SPEAKER_10]: With protruding abdomens.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a sketch.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Face hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Arms burning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: P4.5.
[SPEAKER_10]: Face and arms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Feel burned.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like exposure to radiation or extreme sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very fast burn.
[SPEAKER_16]: The experience left her with long-lasting
and painful sores on her young body.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what's interesting about all of
these sessions, one thing that has come
[SPEAKER_09]: through for me in all of the sessions is
it's the air, the climate.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just very charged.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's electrified.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's palpable.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can feel the air around you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And doing a session where you pick up
something that's glassy, that has depth to
[SPEAKER_09]: it, it just makes me think of a portal.
[SPEAKER_09]: We may be in an area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it's a portal to another
interdimensional space.
[SPEAKER_16]: Behind these hay bales is the town of Deer
Lodge.
[SPEAKER_16]: Along this ridge right here is the area
known as Red Gate.
[SPEAKER_16]: Up here on the mountainside, the bare spot
that looks like an upside-down flying
[SPEAKER_16]: bird, that's where the snowmobilers were,
okay?
[SPEAKER_16]: And other instances occurred right over in
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: The point is, it all happened right here.
[SPEAKER_19]: My sister Linda has always been
straightforward with her questions and
[SPEAKER_19]: with her answers.
[SPEAKER_19]: And she's always curious.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's been extremely curious about what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_19]: She's got a medical career.
[SPEAKER_19]: Being curious, she's endeavored to seek
answers for the questions that she's had.
[SPEAKER_19]: And be it in the medical field or where,
she's chased them down.
[SPEAKER_30]: Even to this day, some of the people's
families don't want them to talk about it
[SPEAKER_30]: because they're afraid of ridicule of the
public or maybe they have public jobs and
[SPEAKER_30]: they don't want people that they deal with
to think that they're too edgy.
[SPEAKER_25]: It seems like it's extremely unnatural to
not want to tell everybody you meet that
[SPEAKER_25]: you have little brave friends that you
talk to.
[SPEAKER_25]: And the more I think about some of the
other things that have happened later in
[SPEAKER_25]: life, there's a very strong possibility
that this was
[SPEAKER_25]: a suggestion of theirs that I had no need
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the UFOs, I believe that non-human
life, extraterrestrials have been here all
[SPEAKER_10]: along.
[SPEAKER_10]: And personally, I don't make a big deal
out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand a lot of the secrecy
behind it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for me, I think they're a part of our
daily lives on many areas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some are physical, some are in different
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some are good, some are not so good.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of them are like people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they're not better than us,
they're simply different.
[SPEAKER_09]: My thought about UFOs is that they're
becoming more and more prevalent in our
[SPEAKER_09]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are hearing more stories about UFOs and
it's through remote viewing that we are
[SPEAKER_09]: able to actually perceive and better
explain the UFO phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we are in a time when our
consciousness is expanding and it's
[SPEAKER_09]: expanding so that we are able to see other
things outside of time and space.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're opening up our consciousness
inter-dimensionally and we can do this
[SPEAKER_09]: with remote viewing.
[SPEAKER_12]: My personal opinion of UFOs and subjects
who claim to have seen UFOs is that I'm
[SPEAKER_12]: certainly open to the wide possibility
that these are real phenomena.
[SPEAKER_12]: Proving this as a scientist is difficult.
[SPEAKER_12]: But so many honest and honorable and
decent, normal human beings have claimed
[SPEAKER_12]: these phenomena.
[SPEAKER_12]: These same people could put you in jail or
be on a jury and give you a life sentence.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we would believe them in these
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe these people have had UFO
experiences or certainly they believe they
[SPEAKER_12]: have had UFO experiences.
[SPEAKER_12]: With as big as the universe is,
there's no reason to think there isn't
[SPEAKER_12]: other life forms in the universe.
[SPEAKER_17]: The Red Gate Project is impressive for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_17]: The researchers are good people who have
used professional approaches in their
[SPEAKER_17]: investigative interviews.
[SPEAKER_17]: They've used remote viewing, hypnosis
sessions, polygraph sessions, and they're
[SPEAKER_17]: combining their efforts with good people
from a community that seems to be
[SPEAKER_17]: supportive of letting this information
come into public view.
[SPEAKER_17]: Good people who are courageous and who are
showing the world that their experiences
[SPEAKER_17]: are important to them and, in my opinion,
important to the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pleased to be a part of this project.
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the message is to not continue to
search in our past, but to grow and get
[SPEAKER_30]: beyond what's happened and to understand
that it's just a part of our life and that
[SPEAKER_30]: we just need to learn from it and move on
and explore what's ahead.
[SPEAKER_16]: After all her searching, Linda Kroonquist
finally accepted the reality of her
[SPEAKER_16]: experiences and has been reconciled with
her childhood memories.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_16]: The secret of Red Gate is that so many
people in one small American community now
[SPEAKER_16]: know that there is so much more to the
universe than what we see and experience
[SPEAKER_16]: in our everyday lives.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
