[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_03]: clan-destined scene through the eyes of
the folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-dog, Breeder and Grower from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here today with Dr. Daniella
Vergara.
[SPEAKER_07]: She received her bachelor's in
microbiology from Universidad de los
[SPEAKER_07]: Andes, Colombia, 2006, and her PhD in
ecology, evolution, behavior, minor in
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics from Indiana University,
Bloomington.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is an emerging crop specialist at
Cornell University and a research
[SPEAKER_07]: associate and lecturer at the university
and a postdoc at Colorado in Boulder,
[SPEAKER_07]: starting 2013 in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I started as a postdoc in CU Boulder
in 2013, and then I became a research
[SPEAKER_01]: associate in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I started researching cannabis in
2013 at CU Boulder.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I reached out to you because,
you know, going through looking at a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of the science that's been done,
whether it's by larger organizations that
[SPEAKER_07]: have worked with breeders and collected
DNA and data, I've noticed that there is a
[SPEAKER_07]: big falling out or maybe a disconnect in
communication between maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: people that are more serious in the
traditional cannabis market versus the
[SPEAKER_07]: academic cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like there's a big disconnect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I reached out to you and I was like,
hey, let's talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know that anybody's talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: You seem really super cool and you
actually care.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I wanted to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought, what better way to do it
here and like maybe record it and for
[SPEAKER_07]: posterity and see if we can get anywhere
and what we can learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you so much for showing up and
sitting down and doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people wouldn't, you know,
not it's not a big show yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, to be honest, I don't think
that there is a disconnect between the
[SPEAKER_01]: academic world and the science academic
cannabis world and the cannabis world in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that academics are disconnected
from the world, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I think that in general,
there is a disconnect between what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: in academia and what happens in real life
and what real life people get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, not just in cannabis,
but overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that you are totally spot on on
what you just said.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the first things we talked about
was how genetics work out what we see,
[SPEAKER_07]: what we don't see.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I figured with our show, I wanted to
define some of these terms that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be using and who better to help
me define them than someone that's working
[SPEAKER_07]: with the breeding program at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we talk about phenotypes a lot in
cannabis in generally using the term.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way I learned the term was
phenotype types are like the observable
[SPEAKER_07]: traits, the physical observable traits and
genotypes are the genes that underlie
[SPEAKER_07]: those physical observable traits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we use the term phenotypes,
we are referring to the observable traits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so people understand there are genes
underlying those observable traits,
[SPEAKER_07]: which are the actual genotypes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I pronouncing that correctly?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything I'm missing out though?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, a phenotype you can measure
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a phenotype could be height that you
can measure using a meter stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in cannabis, it's cannabinoids that you
can measure using an HPLC or a GC machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a phenotype you can measure somehow
with a tool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And genes need a gene mapping tool of some
sort or measuring tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to sequence for you to see the
letters of the DNA in order to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, the DNA has four letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those four letters are repeated in the
genome in different amounts, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a thing that you can quantify the
number of Gs or Cs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's G, C, A, and T.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number of GCs in your genomic
content, you can quantify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to figure out a gene,
you need to sequence that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many different ways for you to be
able to sequence that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like transcribe the gene in
order to figure out the specific letters
[SPEAKER_01]: of the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a much more complicated process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can measure your height easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you are measuring the height
or the number of leaves or the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes of a plant, you can do that fairly
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order for you to take the DNA out,
so you need to do a DNA extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you need to take the DNA
extraction into a facility that sequence
[SPEAKER_01]: it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a much more complex methodology.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is this what you do at Cornell?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you working at the gene level on the
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Cornell, I'm actually part of the
extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm at Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually working with farmers and
the cannabis industry in general and the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis at all levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly for grain and for fiber and for
cannabinoids that are not THC because THC
[SPEAKER_01]: is still federally regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as academic institutions, we cannot
work with high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do work with other cannabinoids,
which is kind of like a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you do to enhance CBD, you do to
enhance THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do go to facilities and to work with
growers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the attitude in Colombia like
growing up for a young lady, just an
[SPEAKER_07]: average young lady where you grew up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it positive?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it negative?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up during a very violent time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Colombia has never not had a
violent time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I grew up during the narco time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a very violent time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time, they were putting bombs
in discos and bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hometown, Cali, Colombia was the
hub of a big cartel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, I mean, I remember my teenage
years very fondly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a lot of fun with friends and I
would go out dancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do remember my parents, my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom is kind of graphic with her
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: She would say things like, I don't care if
you're with a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if there is a bomb, I want to know
where I'm going to pick up the leftovers
[SPEAKER_01]: of my daughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit more descriptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: More descriptive than what I just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were, I mean, I do have very
graphic, gruesome memories of what was
[SPEAKER_01]: ongoing in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, I did grow up in a medium,
high income household.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad is a university professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom is an attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both the retired types now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did grow up in a very intellectual
type of family.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still talk politics on the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which coming to the US was weird for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to like, why are you voting for
that person?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not in a bad way, but tell me what is
that person offering that I should vote
[SPEAKER_01]: for that person?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially talking about elections that
are coming tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very restrained here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you have to be because you don't
know who's leaning which way and it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: and especially now the country is very
divided, super divided.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colombia as well, especially with the
last president whom I am kind of proud
[SPEAKER_01]: that the guy got elected, Gustavo Petro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because I think he's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't think any politician is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I disagree with 99% of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I disagree with the choices I made this
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the most intolerant person in this
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like five feet two of
intolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that Petro offers a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: He offers something that has never been in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Colombia has always been an
oligarchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia has always been a minority that
has ruled the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after particular presidents
before, now the oligarchy is the owner of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cocaine exports, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have to be honest as Colombians
about it that coca is the biggest export
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colombia, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the country's main export.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's emeralds and bananas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But realistically we know where the
majority of the money is coming from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we cannot just be, you know,
like, yeah, it's it's real.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so with that in mind, you know,
I think that Gustavo Petro comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: like, hey, the war on drugs have not
worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave a speech at the United Nations a
month ago or so that I recommend for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost cried because he said it out loud
like, hey, this hasn't worked and we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to change things and we need to try
something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we already know that the money
that America has have given us to stop the
[SPEAKER_01]: coca plantations that that has only
brought violence and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's try to do something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we're something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that was really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is now looking to I mean,
medical marijuana has been legalized in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia and now they're looking for
recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I think that all drugs,
quoting quote, should be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have a clear definition of what
is a drug.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, chocolate is a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's so many things that are drugs
that are intoxicants that could be
[SPEAKER_07]: addicting and that even aren't that aren't
even necessarily affecting our central
[SPEAKER_07]: nervous system that could be addicting in
other ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so, yeah, that's not clearly
defined.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think people get that pleasure hit
from all kinds of different things,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and that could drive all kinds
of factors in their life that could be
[SPEAKER_07]: positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really really open ended that the
way they've left it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think anybody who's especially
politicians, any any politician that's
[SPEAKER_07]: willing to look at the war on drugs,
the negative effects it's had on everyone,
[SPEAKER_07]: the way it's driven America's like
privatized prisons, everything,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I'm all for anybody pushing for
just total abolishment of illegal,
[SPEAKER_07]: like the idea of illegal drugs,
the idea of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think that maybe you and I are
being utopic, you know, like I don't know.
Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we know that Oregon,
for example, has these laws that they
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize a bunch of different drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal, right, as a country did as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado right now has in the ballot
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is happening in some places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that that I am asking for
for total legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many big players that are
benefiting from mass incarceration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wars in drugs like the wars in drugs
have been very successful for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And military contracts galore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you grew up, I assume because it
was like narco wars where you grew up,
[SPEAKER_07]: was the attitude of your parents like more
down on cannabis like you cannot we do not
[SPEAKER_07]: want to see you using cannabis or were
they more open minded on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my parents have always been kind of the
hippies of their families in a way,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though, you know, I again,
my family has always been kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: academia and and that's not my dad is a
physics professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew up going to his university
studying music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had music lessons there when I was a
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always grown up in a university
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never in my life ever left the
university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you believe that?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just changed, you know, different
university from different places in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia or in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've always been on a sort of campus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to surround yourself with
education like that, though, it's got to
[SPEAKER_07]: be your passion to constantly learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but as I told you, I am an
intolerant human being and I have my big
[SPEAKER_01]: fights with academia every single day and
with bureaucracy every single day and
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, like I have my big fights
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe in the education system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's, again, benefiting a
tiny minority.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that this thing that Biden
is proposing about about student loan,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that that is just a little
bandaid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than nothing, but it is not
solving the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that all of these academic
institutions, some more than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I've been in the U.S.,
I've been in three now, I kind of know a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have academic friends all over,
so I kind of know how they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these academic institutions are
profiting out of the most vulnerable side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the population, which are, you know,
20 year olds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are benefiting a minority of
administrators who do not care about the
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, I feel that professors,
especially those in tenure track
[SPEAKER_01]: positions, are just there kind of like,
oh, well, you know, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of that with tenure,
like in any any sort of like teaching
[SPEAKER_07]: profession, whether it's like elementary
school all the way to university,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once they get that, it's just like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got there and you're sitting down.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one can fire you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes an act of God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is that is a good descriptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes an act of God to fire a tenure
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can do despicable things,
you know, like, oh, sure, harassment,
[SPEAKER_01]: sexual harassment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're still in this tenure track
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to fight for their
students or few of them are going to fight
[SPEAKER_01]: for the students.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot put all of the people in the same
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, they don't fight for the
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fight for changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fight for, you know,
more funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards benefiting their labs or they're
just there and no one no one's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fire them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a secure pension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I that's one of my fights with
academia is kind of like this lethargic
[SPEAKER_01]: state of the tenure track with professors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that's a lot of people that
are the money and my friends in academia.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one thing that they have the
most trouble with, especially if they're
[SPEAKER_07]: vocal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a lot of people will take it on
the chin and just try to go with it and
[SPEAKER_07]: try to work within that system.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like my personality, I'm one of those
personalities where like I have no filter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just comes out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if I the last in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see you're kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wonder how that goes for you.
Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was in CU Boulder, I'm still at
CU Boulder as a lecturer and as a
[SPEAKER_01]: researcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was there in Colorado,
I was in Colorado for eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was part of the union.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am total union proponent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that in a perfect world,
you shouldn't have unions because people
[SPEAKER_01]: should not need to unionize again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If people weren't greedy, you wouldn't
need a union.
[SPEAKER_07]: But people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if there weren't like Elon's and
Jeff's around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then then that you should have health
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you should have to be normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a given.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have parental leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because these things are not the norm,
then you should unionize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, so I was part of the
union and I was very vocal about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were some people that need not
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, like I am a very big
proponent of free speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have the right to not follow you on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the right to tell you,
Matthew, shut up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can't say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have the right to, you know,
close my ears.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And adults should be able to like make
that decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that should be an easy decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm a big proponent of the block
feature on all social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes life so much better because like
I don't I don't if someone doesn't like me
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're going to say mean things about
me, I'm not going to sit there and like
[SPEAKER_07]: dwell on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, well, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I don't have to see it ever again.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to see me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Life goes on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can just mute you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that option for a reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a great option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but and also because of the cannabis
thing, you know, when I for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've always been a pothead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of that closet after women grow,
you know, after I was in a women grow
[SPEAKER_01]: event and I was in the first cohort of
women grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when women grow started back in 2014
with Jane West and and Julie Baker,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's and has me that yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it completely opened my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was coming from my Ph.D.,
which I was talking nerd to other nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went into a completely
different world in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, when I started working in
cannabis, it was a plant that I was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be studying the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was really interested in the
male and female thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was going to start, you know,
like very academic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get into this industry that for
me was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an industry, an entire industry
where you have lawyers and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: accountants and you have designers and you
have every and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: A marketer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like first time in my life that I met a
marketer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it was completely mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then when I was in this women grow
events, I am a biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a field biologist for a long time,
field biologist, rubber boot type of field
[SPEAKER_01]: biologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I got there and I see all of
these women, you know, lipstick and high
[SPEAKER_01]: heels with a joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I, you know, I was a hippie kind of
flip flop type of thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: rubber boot with a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see these women that are
super accomplished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Economist, finance, financial analyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, I was I am leaving this
closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so the cannabis industry opened my
scientific sphere and my I guess my my
[SPEAKER_01]: professional and personal life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opened it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you first started smoking,
when did you first start realizing that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I mean, the conversation is
inevitably going to go one place.
[SPEAKER_07]: When did you first start noticing that
maybe like there wasn't there was
[SPEAKER_07]: inconsistency between what you would get
at a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_07]: Between strains that they would assure you
were the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Meaning, you know, you a lot of people go
into dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: They expect a certain medical effect from
whatever certain strain they buy and they
[SPEAKER_07]: want to rely on that medical effect for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: When did you start noticing any kind of
inconsistency or any of that in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that your listeners do not hate
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, they won't.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good people.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: My palate is either yes or no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's usually yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in general, with food,
I am a very good eater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't eat junk food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, everything tastes good,
except for maybe cauliflower without
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is the same thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I'm high or not high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different differences between,
oh, this one really made it very cerebral
[SPEAKER_01]: or this one really gave me a couch lock or
this one just, you know, it made me like I
[SPEAKER_01]: am completely doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of anything else,
plus I have a volcano on when you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: volcano and you vaporize it that way,
kind of like the smells and all of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really thought that all of that
cannabinoids and terpenes and all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: was just, you know, potheads saying stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a lot of people look at wine or
whatever they call it, sommeliers,
[SPEAKER_01]: sommeliers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that that was kind of BS
until I analyzed data for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was data that changed my mind when I
started analyzing cannabinoid and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and the amounts and the distribution and
the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one has one and not the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I was like, oh, this is for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's been multiple studies
throughout the years that just corroborate
[SPEAKER_01]: that I just have a terrible palate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a for real thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you're describing to me is like
with my wife, she smoked when she was
[SPEAKER_07]: young, like a bunch, but she didn't really
ever get into like, oh, I'm going to smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: this strain that she didn't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like she was just getting weed,
whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once we got together, I, you know,
like I'd say, yeah, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: X kind of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's looking at me.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, I smell weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like, and it took, and it's
taken until probably the last year to
[SPEAKER_07]: where her palate's finally getting,
oh, I see what you're saying now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, but it takes a long, long time and
constant really getting into it to develop
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an effort, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when I go to grows, for example,
I usually, what I do is that I rub the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant with my fingers and then I smell my
finger, but there is indeed some that
[SPEAKER_01]: smell like skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is indeed some that smell like
lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are others that smell more forestry,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's definitely the pine thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you look at the chemo types
in the studies that I've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you see, Oh, there is indeed a
terpene called pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this other one better
cryophiline and there's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not a lie, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so now, and recently, uh, I got
something that smelled really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really skunky and I was like, Oh man,
this is really skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a skunk that lives around my
house and I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We finally made the scent connection in
your brain to the smell and everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so in that sense, but,
but yeah, but in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked, there was one strain that
we could get in Colorado long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was around 20, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2013, 14, 15, which was this tangerine
haste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had friends in Colorado growing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but other than that, I also like
edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you like really, do you like the fact
that, I mean, do you like edibles that are
[SPEAKER_07]: super strong and will lay you out for
hours?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you like the ones that are more calm
and not as strong?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always have THC CBD together,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that has both, but,
um, I like whatever gives me energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do house chores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I do not understand how people do
house chores.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they vacuum and sweep and clean a
bathroom while sober?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, you got me on that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like to be motivated to do that while
you're sober.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are you going to do today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to clean the toilet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, whoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I need, you know, so I take the cookie
and then recently, a friend of mine gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me these cookies that have Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this Delta eight, I love it,
you know, and I love the chemistry behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it, the biochemistry, because all of these
compounds, the differences where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: this double bonds, the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Delta nine, you have the double bond
between two carbons between carbons eight
[SPEAKER_01]: and nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Delta eight, you have the double
bond between carbons seven and eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's I like that kind of like,
okay, why, why is it called this way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides chemistry has always been,
um, difficult subject for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't come naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really have to read and so,
um, so that he gave me this Delta eight
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, those Delta eight cookies,
I am super active for three hours and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, or four hours max.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just fall asleep and it's like
falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be sitting in the table and then I
just, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so, it's so amazing how, how
different, like the, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: chemistry affects everyone's different
brain chemistry, like vastly different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it could even be like beginning of the
day, smoking the same exact strain,
[SPEAKER_07]: the same amount, you know, like will make
you feel completely different than at
[SPEAKER_07]: night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it's, it's, it's wild and it's
taken me so many years to understand the
[SPEAKER_07]: variance even between clones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that, that's something a lot of
breeders in cannabis, like the past
[SPEAKER_07]: several years, like I haven't really even
come to that conclusion or understanding
[SPEAKER_07]: yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'll often have people message me and
be like, Hey, I have this clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought it at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know if this is the old clone
that you and your group remember from,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll say one, I can't identify anything
by pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll be like, why?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And well, because it may grow very
differently in your room than it does in
[SPEAKER_07]: the other room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people don't get how vast that
difference can be.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be, I tried to explain with the UK
cheese, I've had it turn out super
[SPEAKER_07]: blueberry fruity and look, you know,
a little short and stout all the way to a
[SPEAKER_07]: very lanky, tall, very, what people would
consider typically sativa plant that's
[SPEAKER_07]: foot funk cheese.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the same clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So can you talk about some of the,
the, the genetic reasons behind that
[SPEAKER_07]: variance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super interesting that you
mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any physical characteristic,
which a physical characteristic is a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype, anything that you can measure
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a product of genes and the
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some physical traits that are
more genetically dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are others that are more
environmentally dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give you the same two
examples that I always give.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that if people have been in my
talks before, I'm sorry for repeating
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, but human height is highly
genetically a heritable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your parents are tall, it's likely
that you're going to be tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your parents are short, it's likely
that you're going to be short.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 80% heritability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that 20% is environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that 20% is usually what you ate while
you were growing up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You had good nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may achieve that potential height,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had poor nutrition, you may not,
but it's 80% genetics, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other traits like weight,
which also has a genetic component.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people that are more prone
to be, you know, a little bit thicker than
[SPEAKER_01]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you eat a particular diet,
you're more prone to have more weight or
[SPEAKER_01]: less weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can control the amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more environmental than it is,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing the same clone in a
completely different environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have what you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a completely different plant,
particularly because we know that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, for example, is very
photosensitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have very good lights,
it's more likely that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce more cannabinoids and that your
plant is probably going to be happier than
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have fewer lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you put your plant in a closet in
the basement with no lights, it probably
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to die, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that environment is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we don't know is of these
cannabinoids and terpenes, it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: complex phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very complex phenotype that
involves multiple genes acting in unison,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this Jordan Sager, who's the
CEO of Dewey Scientific in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a paper with who was his postdoc
advisor, Mark Lange in Washington state in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pullman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have this paper that I really
like where they talk about all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genes related to cannabinoid and terpene
production as a network.
[SPEAKER_01]: of genes kind of acting together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a really good
description, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we in biology called epistasis,
which is kind of like two genes acting on
[SPEAKER_01]: a particular phenotype and pleiotropy,
which is two different phenotypes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled one by one gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this pleiotropic and this
epistatic effects acting in unison for
[SPEAKER_01]: this very complex phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we don't know how much of it is
environmentally determined and how much is
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there is a genetic component
for sure, but we don't know how much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if it's going to be like
weight or is it going to be like height in
[SPEAKER_01]: humans, weight in humans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the experiments for you to figure that
out are quote unquote simple, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to have several generations
or you can do, for example, the same clone
[SPEAKER_01]: in different environments and then measure
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but I agree with what you said
to your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this blue cheese?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it could be.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a mother to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a hybrid of it or it could be
something that just totally expresses
[SPEAKER_07]: similar and not related to whatsoever
because cannabis is wild and plastic like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has plasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is that we know that
there is a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of genomic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the genome, all of the conglomerate
of DNA of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the letters of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it's very diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three to four times as diverse as
humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very, very diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have that amount of diversity,
you can have a lot of diversity in your
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So full sibs may be completely different
to each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, you know, probably this
chem dog number one and chem dog number
[SPEAKER_01]: four, which were probably full sibs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're completely different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reason why it makes sense for you to
clone the plants, because when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning them, then you're assuring that
they're going to be more similar to the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plants than if you have seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I think that we need really
good breeding in cannabis, in marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in hemp, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, cannabis is hemp and
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in hemp, it's happening for grain and
for fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Europe has done some good job at
breeding and China as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for marijuana, I think that we need to
have good breeding and good breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: particular locations, because especially
if you're growing outdoors, because Amble
[SPEAKER_01]: County, California has a very different
environment than upstate New York or than
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing outdoors,
I think that you need to have really good
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that that happens in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it is happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's been happening for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the ratio of people doing that kind of
work to the people just putting something
[SPEAKER_07]: on the market to make money is it's very
low, like the amount of people like doing
[SPEAKER_07]: serious breeding work versus I'm going to
cross this to this and see what happens
[SPEAKER_07]: because the names are cool, you know,
and putting it out on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of that now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's typically what we see in the
breeding market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there are very reputable
companies in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one company from Colorado,
Trilogy, I think that they're they're good
[SPEAKER_01]: at what they do, for example, as breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do agree with you that the naming
thing is what we know that the naming
[SPEAKER_01]: convention is is just BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that sativa, indica, hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not mean much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you're trying to group
traits like this is sativa because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: lengthy and tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has high THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those traits are completely
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like me saying like, oh, you are tall
because you have brown eyes like that is
[SPEAKER_01]: not related whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a dog is tall because it's white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that doesn't have any sort of
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we know, for example,
that there are strains that have nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Girl Scout cookies, for example,
Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have two strains, Girl Scout
cookies that are more closely related to
[SPEAKER_01]: something completely different except to
each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people ask me my recommendation,
what I tell them is, well, you name this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, blue dream, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You name this blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then and they got, I don't know,
a cannabis high times cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then rename it next time and just call it
I don't know, dream blue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's typically how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rename it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or then, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or then just this blue dream got whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then name another strain blue dream as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, and then when people tell me like,
well, but mine is the real blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you whether your blue dream is
related to other blue dreams, but I cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: say who's the real one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like which one is the real OG?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: See.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, that's what's like the most
fascinating part of the topic to me is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend, Matt pointed out to me,
he's like, it's anthropology, Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, cause I was trying to explain to
him, like, how do I explain to a scientist
[SPEAKER_07]: what we do and why what we do is reliable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most importantly, cause like anybody can
say like, yeah, I got this cut and yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I said, it's real or it's real
because this guy told me and he's old,
[SPEAKER_07]: like these are not good.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not science.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is anthropology to it in the
sense that, uh, you know, there are people
[SPEAKER_07]: that have been alive and in this,
in the scene for X amount of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're there when this strain first
popped up, watch where it came from
[SPEAKER_07]: already were that kind of person that
would record that kind of data,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and there are these guys in the
cannabis world that exist and have existed
[SPEAKER_07]: like total nerds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are these people that exist in
the cannabis world that are kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: reclusive.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's very, it's been a task.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's what I've devoted my life to
is figuring out who these people are,
[SPEAKER_07]: where they're at.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I can shake down their story and
really figure out, is this one,
[SPEAKER_07]: is this provable?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it plausible?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probable or total BS?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause there's four answers you can get
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of them are right in between two
and three, you know, there's very little
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff that we can be like, okay,
we know this came from, for example,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, Dave Watson.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know skunk one came from Dave Watson,
1975, roughly, you know, we know that for
[SPEAKER_07]: a fact because it was well documented at
the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in books at the time, multiple
different sources.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's still around, can still give,
you know, statements that are all
[SPEAKER_07]: contemporaneous with what was going on at
the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: The story hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, however, then we have stories like
purple oracle where we have nine to 10
[SPEAKER_07]: different claimants.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of them can show that they had any
kind of parental progeny or documentation
[SPEAKER_07]: on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's one of those stories that sits.
[SPEAKER_07]: But oddly enough with things like Goji
Kush, we can, we have pretty good
[SPEAKER_07]: documentation of certain strains like that
because enough people were around.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't so long ago that a lot of people
that were around then are still around,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, but it's debatable regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it would be super cool to
be able to do some genetic study that may
[SPEAKER_01]: corroborate all of these stories,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the most important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I think that that could be super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would be a little hesitant because I
have gotten a lot of sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a lot of, no, some negative vibes from
certain people about genomics work and
[SPEAKER_01]: about, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these tools that are super powerful
and that are going to change the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that part I feel, you know,
like saying kind of like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is really not blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be someone that's not going to
like it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard a lot of feelings in this
industry that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you heard a lot of feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it would be a really cool,
um, genetic study that corroborates this
[SPEAKER_01]: anthropological study, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done that with dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done that with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we know for example,
that dogs were domesticated multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: times, uh, by multiple cultures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is pretty crazy, but we also had
anthropological evidence that the Chinese,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, had dogs and that,
um, there were also dogs in, in Europe and
[SPEAKER_01]: in America, in the Americas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we know that dogs were domesticated
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know, for example, in humans,
one really cool study that I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up, you know, we, we know that when
Christopher Columbus came to, to America,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, they basically, um, the Spanish were
different from the British, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The British kind of sent colonies in,
in North America, the Spanish just took
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the gold and left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were not planning on really
staying in South America, but they did,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, rape women, men, and then took
the gold and left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have some evidence,
genetic evidence that many of the genes
[SPEAKER_01]: that are coming from men are from Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the genes that are from women
are from native women in South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this beautiful study that
was published in PNAS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that it was probably
around 2011 or 2012 that took what we knew
[SPEAKER_01]: anthropologically and had this genetic
study about the human mitochondria that is
[SPEAKER_01]: inherited through the mother and the Y
chromosome that is inherited through the
[SPEAKER_01]: father.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so beautiful to see,
you know, the parallels between genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, genomics and anthropology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in cannabis could be
similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I guess that's how you make
anthropology scientific, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is, is you back up the data or you back it
up with data.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, yeah, I know there was,
we had talked about this about 10 years
[SPEAKER_07]: ago, we were going to start doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just specifically with the OG Kush
project.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the problem was one, of course,
you have to source all of these cuts
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically from the most reliable
sources and the most reliable sources in
[SPEAKER_07]: quotes, because that's, it's only going to
be what people tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you get enough of them,
you can kind of get an idea, a very good
[SPEAKER_07]: idea, especially when, you know,
multiple people confirm certain sources.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were going to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, we didn't know of
any reliable place, except there was one
[SPEAKER_07]: company at the time called Philos to even
do the testing to tell us the,
[SPEAKER_07]: the, the matrilineal, patrilineal
relations, any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they, any OG that was submitted to
them, they all said was the same clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were not able to tell when it was
obvious, like when someone was like giving
[SPEAKER_07]: a known self line, like saying,
I popped the seed from a known self line
[SPEAKER_07]: from this clone, I'll send you a clone of
this and a clone of this, send it to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was showing up as the exact same
clone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we already knew it wasn't going to be
reliable from the jump, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so Philos, they do have that galaxy,
which is trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they have done a good job at
the galaxy and they have all of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pushes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so their, their galaxy, I know the
tests behind the algorithms behind that
[SPEAKER_01]: galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the cool thing is that you can
shift it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can kind of zoom in to a
particular part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I disagree or, I don't know what are
they doing right now regarding their
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing, but I disagree with particular
ways of sequencing the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's other ways of
sequencing where you can get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: information and you can also explore other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have multiple individuals,
multiple courses that are, that may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: related to each other and they are all
appearing as the same clone, I would be
[SPEAKER_01]: hesitant about those results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it may be the way that
they're sequencing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so there are, for example,
for paternity tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to figure out whether that is your
child or not, there are particular genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: regions that you sequence and not other
genomic regions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You sequence genomic regions that are very
varied between individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are genes that are extremely
conserved between you and I that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're Mexican and Colombian,
they may not differ.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but there are reliable paternity
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to figure out which region of
the genome you're sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there could have been a
problem with phylos doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, in a hypothetical situation,
I'll say it that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we were taking a, a clone mom,
like let's for the, for example,
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll call this Sendo Sterps and a,
a Lubbacush, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were taking that mother clone and
the other mother clone, submitting those
[SPEAKER_07]: to phylos.
[SPEAKER_07]: We crossed them together, ran the progeny.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that one, I mean, the progeny is
all either Bubbacush or Mendopurps or a
[SPEAKER_07]: variance of it's very reliable and
breeding, sent them a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And none of them showed related at all
between all three.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when we were like, okay,
so we have the OG Kush data.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some pretty known data when it
comes to cookies on cookies parentage and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not showing up in phylos data.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we did that to kind of test and
see how hypothetically we did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Allegedly that was done to see how,
if, if it would really show up like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in one case there was like Chem 91 and
Chem 91 S1 self line sent, and they were
[SPEAKER_07]: able to tell this as a self version of
that or really close relation to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in many cases, they couldn't tell
direct relations from each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was, there was no consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like sometimes it was right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes it was just so off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really confusing to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I never knew why it never made any
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, I don't understand the science
behind how they collect the data where the
[SPEAKER_07]: error would have been, but it's always
fascinated me to no end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to explain something to you,
which I think could, could be,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's for sure,
but it could be one of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are sequencing a genome,
right, you have all of the letters of the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's multiple ways of sequencing the
genome, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one way that is called whole
genome shotgun, where you take the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: genome and you sequence it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're sequencing whole genome
shotgun, there's something that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: called the coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the coverage is the amount of times
that on average, each letter of the DNA is
[SPEAKER_01]: being sequenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on average, if you have one X on
average, each letter is sequenced one
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have 10 X on average, each letter
is sequenced 10 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a hundred X on average,
each letter is sequenced a hundred times,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like whole genome shotgun,
even if it's one X, because you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire genome and you can look at
different regions of the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, it is cheaper
per letter to sequence the entire genome
[SPEAKER_01]: at a whole genome shotgun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is another way of sequencing the
genome, which is called genotyping by
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing, GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: In GBS, what you do is that you take the
genome and then you break it down into
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces with these enzymes, these proteins
that are kind of like these little
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors that you break the genome into
pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you end up sequencing only 1% of
the genome, approximately, 1, 2% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: GBS helps you to figure out whether you're
more closely related to me or whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you're more closely related to your mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, GBS has a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the problem is repetition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you do it with the same
restriction enzymes, the same pair of
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors, and even if you follow the same
protocol, repetition is not consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a paper showing that the
repetition in GBS is not consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to that, even though it's
cheaper because you're only sequencing 1%,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cheaper in general per letter,
it is not cheaper than whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: shotgun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are different pairs of scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different restriction enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have this study in 2016 that we
compared the GBS data from one group to
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they had used different
restriction enzymes, we could not compare
[SPEAKER_01]: the data between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could just compare it to the whole
genome shotgun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one against the whole genome
shotgun, this one against the whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: shotgun, but we couldn't compare these
two.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there were no overlaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is my understanding that
phylo-sequencing sequences GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they still do,
but at least at some point in their lives
[SPEAKER_01]: they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always questioning that reasoning,
whether it's for profits because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to spend more money or because the
questions that you have, you just need to
[SPEAKER_01]: know whether you're more closely related
to your mom than to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you cannot look at the repetitive
content of the genome, the junk DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot look at whole genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot look whether these entire genes
have different copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I question GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that may be one of the
reasons why they got those results with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be surprised with GBS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, I am really sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bump things in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a hair somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the type of person that is trying to
look neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never been good at doing something
more than DNA extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: My DNA extractions are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have to do something like GBS,
where you have to sonicate, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do the restriction enzyme,
and then you have to do this other,
[SPEAKER_01]: that wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to have a really good
technician, even then, your results are
[SPEAKER_01]: not repeatable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're not repeatable,
isn't that what science is?
[SPEAKER_07]: To be able to show something is
repeatable, to have repeatable results,
[SPEAKER_07]: to make a valid... I mean, I'm a layman.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm good at English and history and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I'm wrong, correct me.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that also makes me think, OK,
so if that data is incorrect with just
[SPEAKER_07]: those very few examples that we noticed,
and we're one out of tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_07]: people who use this, when they go to
cell-set data, if it doesn't merge well
[SPEAKER_07]: with other people's data sets,
said data might end up worthless.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all that investment and savings that
they went to be cheaper to save,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever, if that was the theory in it,
would end up not working out so well,
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it just... From my point of view,
as someone who's like a history and not a
[SPEAKER_07]: math person or a science person,
it doesn't make much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, people in the world,
I'm going to say something that,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, we know that there's a lot of
science that it's not repeatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Excel spreadsheets,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that Excel spreadsheets,
when you type one, whatever, it translates
[SPEAKER_01]: it to January 12th.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's thinking, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we know that Excel screws things
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also know that there's other
science, old science, that may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: repeatable right now, that at that time,
so similar to GBS, I think that GBS,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be a few years until people
stop using it for these reasons and for
[SPEAKER_01]: other reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other techniques, enzymatic
techniques, that people do not use
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used it a lot of times during my PhD
that no one uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give you another example,
studies with mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found out, we in the world,
I mean, we found out that mice respond
[SPEAKER_01]: differently to humans, whether it's a
female that is treating the mice or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a male that's treating the
mice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So results with experimental mice may
differ whether the person conducting that
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment was a woman or a man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it like scent hormone or do they know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know that there is this gap in
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there's a lot of data sets
that are not publicly available,
[SPEAKER_01]: including some from my papers,
one paper because of some reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try to make my data available
because I think it's fair with the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: and particularly because I don't know
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether my analysis was
entirely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether you analyze it
differently and are going to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: different result or right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that I should make all of my
data public for anyone here or in
[SPEAKER_01]: Patagonia, Argentina or in Shanghai,
China to be able to analyze my data and
[SPEAKER_01]: tell me, hey, I did get what you or I
disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in many cases,
that's not the way with science,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not the way with Excel
spreadsheets, that's not the way with...
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that with GBS data,
whenever I see GBS data, I'm not analyzing
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what's funny is because
Phylos was embedded in our subculture for
[SPEAKER_07]: so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was like a good, I don't know,
eight years that people were taking their
[SPEAKER_07]: data and being like making conclusions
from it and making other conclusions from
[SPEAKER_07]: it based on those conclusions.
[SPEAKER_07]: That Phylos had made.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we kind of realized how bad or
inconsistent some of the data was,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was like slowly unraveling stuff in our
head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we always used to make these
conclusions based on that data,
[SPEAKER_07]: but that's now invalid data.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you actually have to go through and
like remove it from your brain,
[SPEAKER_07]: scrub your brain from all this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now when I see people with Phylos data,
I'm like, I don't want to see it because
[SPEAKER_07]: it doesn't matter because it might be
right, but it might not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's an unreliable narrator.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's some things that are
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the relationship between
strains may be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that they're doing breeding,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when all that blew up and a lot
of people's anger at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, I was just more interested in
like, are you putting out good data or bad
[SPEAKER_07]: data?
[SPEAKER_07]: People were purchasing data.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care what you do with any of your
breeding or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, until they started asking for
whole seeds and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's when it became different.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when it came to the data, is this data
consistent with what we're seeing?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when we start finding out it's
not, well, then what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, I think they no longer do data
sequencing and they're just doing their
[SPEAKER_07]: breeding program now, which is cool props
to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they have good luck with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the other things in cannabis that
we ran into over the years that we've been
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to figure out is in cannabis sex
reversal, ethylene plays a major role,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of times we're seeing a clone,
like take a clone, take 60 cuts off a
[SPEAKER_07]: single mom, they'll be in a tray,
10 inch by 20 inch tray, 50 of them next
[SPEAKER_07]: to each other, you'll get 30% distribution
that actually reverse really well,
[SPEAKER_07]: 30% that kind of do and 30% that won't at
all or it'll reverse and won't drop viable
[SPEAKER_07]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And none of us know why.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this has been going on for decades and
none of us can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm interested to hear your take on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, we know that cannabis has X and
Y chromosomes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are an XX, you're a female,
if you're an XY, you're a male,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the Moniches,
which be people in the industry called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's call it Hermes, although they're
actually Moniches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Hermes, we know that there are
particular regions of the chromosomes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are very similar to the female
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we don't know exactly how
different the Moniches chromosomes are
[SPEAKER_01]: from those of the female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know that entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the Y chromosome in the males
it's very big, is the biggest of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're sequencing a genome,
there's something that is called the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an assembly is when you're sequencing
the genome and you have to partition those
[SPEAKER_01]: regions into pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to put them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when coverage comes really handy
because if you have something that is more
[SPEAKER_01]: than one X, so if you have something that
is let's say 100 X, then it's easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to put the puzzles together because
then you have this piece, this piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have this other one, and then you
know you're starting to put your puzzle
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ideally you would have in cannabis,
you would have 11 pieces, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it has nine autosomes,
so nine chromosomes that are not related
[SPEAKER_01]: to sex, nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have an X and then you have a Y,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have 11 different pieces that is
your complete puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a really good assembly that was
produced by Chris Grasa and Chris Grasa et
[SPEAKER_01]: al.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2021, which is a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we do not have the puzzle for the
Y chromosome or the puzzle for the
[SPEAKER_01]: munitious chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that if you have a Y
chromosome, you're very likely to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have two X chromosomes,
you're very likely to produce female
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some varieties, as you said,
that if you put ethylene or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: silver nitrate, whatever, they start
producing flowers from the opposite sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: In males, if you put ethofen, right,
you start producing flowers, female
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some strains that are more prone
than others.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know which are the genes that are
turning on, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that those genes may not be
related to the X and the Y chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that those genes may be somewhere
else in the genome.
Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have the X and the Y
chromosome, you still express,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever sex it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have XY, you're male.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have XX, you're female.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you force them to produce the
other sex, there's some that produce them
[SPEAKER_01]: and some not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe these genes are found somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have some idea of some genes that
are turned on and turned off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is a really
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, when, how do you turn these genes on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just that some individuals do not
have them?
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, even if they're clones of
each other in the same tray, one inch
[SPEAKER_07]: apart, meaning the angles of light are
very similar, like how they're being fed
[SPEAKER_07]: is identical.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see 30% in a random distribution,
not like in one set next to each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll be totally random.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it blows my mind every time that we
just can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just cannot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to explore that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what really caught my attention
in cannabis was that sex part,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never so far worked, you know,
I worked in the cannabinoid genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in, and at the beginning,
when I started working in the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: genes, it was like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that part of the sex is super
interesting to me because the Y
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome, you know, the Y chromosome in
humans is very, very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tiny.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it basically has, you know,
very few genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one gene that says,
Hey everyone, wake up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: express.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I have many of the genes
that you have to produce beer to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the hormones that men produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't have that gene that wakes
everyone up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Y chromosome is tiny, basically
has that one gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, the Y chromosome is
humongous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons why I think that we
do not have a proper assembly is because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so big and it's full with repetitive
elements, junk DNA, and the repetitive
[SPEAKER_01]: elements are repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have repetition, repetition,
repetition.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so difficult to put together because
it's repetitive and repetitive and
[SPEAKER_01]: repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very hard to know when it ends and
when it starts.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we don't know what's going on in
that, in that front.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like the one thing that's driven me
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we developed a spray that is a ready
to mix spray for people that's a silver
[SPEAKER_07]: nitrate, sodium thiosulfate based,
you know, and the one thing that me and a
[SPEAKER_07]: few other people that are making feminize
eats longer than anyone else in the U S
[SPEAKER_07]: that we've just never been able to figure
out that one factor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you sell the spray, people are
always like, well, how do we know for
[SPEAKER_07]: sure?
[SPEAKER_07]: And to tell them, I don't know,
just numbers, bet on numbers, always use
[SPEAKER_07]: high amounts of numbers because odds are
in your favor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually, if you use enough numbers that
you'll have successful, not, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: the one thing I've learned too,
when I did a population of, there was
[SPEAKER_07]: 16,000 plants, 3000 of which I reversed
and it was hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I noticed with hemp is unlike
like high THC cannabis, it reversed
[SPEAKER_07]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually there's like the stagger period in
cannabis, high THC cannabis, where it
[SPEAKER_07]: takes two and a half weeks to then show
their sex as being a male completely
[SPEAKER_07]: reversed in hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were ready to drop for fiber or
grain.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was remedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hemp kush cross.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was more for CBD production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it, and it triggered immediately,
but in that population of 16 or I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_07]: 3000 that were reversed, there was
probably three that didn't reverse at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stayed totally female, no matter how much
they were sprayed with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd never seen that in, in high THC
cannabis, but I had never ran that many
[SPEAKER_07]: plants in high THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was really interesting to see stuff
like that in sexual reversals that there
[SPEAKER_07]: were even plants that were totally
resistant to that kind of spray and sex
[SPEAKER_07]: reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it took seeing a large population that
you can be able to see three, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, I would love to do experiments
with that and see what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what genes are you turning on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What genes are you turning off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever want to work on anything,
I am more than happy to send you whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're always doing all kinds of
experiments using all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_07]: ethylene blockers and all kinds of
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think that you should quantify
those things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of these, however, maybe, because I think
that numbers are so powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of these 16,000, there were,
I don't know, 11,000, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you do it again in,
I don't know, 2025, then you do it again
[SPEAKER_01]: and you quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then you have numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what is the ratio?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the odds?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you sell your product,
you can say like, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it works for 30% of the individuals when
you have 1600.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have more than five or right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find that a lot of like,
um, cannabis breeders that have been doing
[SPEAKER_07]: it a long time, they're off, they all fall
on the autism spectrum hardcore.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of them keep like, refuse to keep
data written down and it's all up here
[SPEAKER_07]: because they've lived with that idea that
like, if I get caught with any kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: numbers or data, I'm going to get busted
and they're going to use it against me.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a court of law.
[SPEAKER_07]: So almost everyone keeps every bit of data
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the likes, I'm not that great at
keeping data stored.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like my memory is not that great,
but some of my friends, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_07]: how do you remember like 25 years of data?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they just magically do, but yeah,
nothing's better than hard written data
[SPEAKER_07]: with, you know, that you can compare and
refer back to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, this is what you referred
to as, you know, something that probably
[SPEAKER_07]: people think is the most controversial
topic that, that you're, that you like
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about is GMO science and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to talk about the future of
cannabis and where you think it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: go from here and where we can go.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's, what are some of the beautiful
things that, that, that GMO science can
[SPEAKER_07]: bring to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, GMO, so I, I have a
non-for-profit organization, the
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural genomics foundation and the
aim of that non-for-profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that I someday can fulfill that
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is to develop genetic tools for
the use of the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: These genetic tools include GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So GMOs is genetically modified organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: What classify as a GMO or not,
that's very debatable, but in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you can, if you need to be in
a lab space for you to put the gene or
[SPEAKER_01]: take it out or express whatever,
then it's probably a GMO, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that GMOs are a very important
tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, we have GMOs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: These big strawberries in the supermarket,
they're polyploid and they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, many, they are not existing
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was humans that somehow made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, artificial selection is been
done by humans, but there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: GMOs in many things that we eat in rice
and a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think GMOs could be super useful for
cannabis, for marijuana, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: to enhance maybe the production of
cannabinoids in hemp to silence certain
[SPEAKER_01]: genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want THC, then it could help.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been a big problem for a lot of
hemp producers is testing hot.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you're growing for
fiber, for grain, why do you care about
[SPEAKER_01]: THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why have to put energy into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes some of these varieties for
grain or for fiber go over 0.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, I don't know, 0.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares if a grain variety has 0.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer, because now he's in,
he or she are in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's serious at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that, for example,
in the specs, determination stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that would be important to
know exactly whether or not your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to produce flowers of the opposite
sex, because sometimes your plants just
[SPEAKER_01]: come out and you then have seeds and it's
like, who was the hermit here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, I think that GMOs could be useful
for that and for hemp, for fiber and for
[SPEAKER_01]: grain as well to produce bigger grain or
to produce plants that maybe this is
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to particular diseases right now
with a changing environment due to the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that those techniques are going to
come very handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, I see a very bright future
in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue for me, these tools are
happening in every single crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just cannabis, they are
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue for me is who owns those tools.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is able to access those tools and
whether the access of those tools is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to benefit the public, the grower,
the consumer, or if it's going to benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: a corporation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's super important,
the politics of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my issue with those tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence why I have the non-profit
organization, which at some point I hope
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can grow enough for, I mean,
I don't know if it's going to be a big
[SPEAKER_01]: enough non-for-profit to combat big
corporations in big ag or big tobacco or
[SPEAKER_01]: big pharma, but maybe we can help the
public somehow.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of funding would we need in
order to be able to make any kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: difference in being able to use this
technology for people that it could
[SPEAKER_07]: benefit that maybe aren't rich?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because I know this technology is
expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of the prohibitive factors and
why you would have to establish a
[SPEAKER_07]: non-profit in order to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of funding would we need?
[SPEAKER_07]: Elon Musk-type funding or is it a few
million?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, many of these companies,
many of these companies in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: space, like the phylostep companies,
medicinal genomics type companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have raised in the millions,
like four, five, six, max 10, less than
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, seven, $8 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that for us at AGF, Agricultural
Genomics Foundation is a non-for-profit
[SPEAKER_01]: that I run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am looking for a few thousand dollars to
start public awareness and public
[SPEAKER_01]: education and to teach people really what
is a genome, how do you do these tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that, a few hundred thousand
dollars could go a long way or a few
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand dollars, less than a hundred
thousand dollars, like a few thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars could go a long way on teaching
people how to use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that everyone is going to become a
genomicist or a bioinformatician,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how to be educated about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to do now is
figuring out how to raise that funding to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to start growing this and to start
educating the public and making some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these tools and then being able to get
this running, basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how far out do you think we are from,
say, turning on or off the gene that is
[SPEAKER_07]: responsible for, let's say, HPLV,
something like that, a viroid that's
[SPEAKER_07]: ravaging cannabis right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: How far out would we be from being able to
combat something like that, GMO speaking?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the hoplite and viroid?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really bad in California?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's bad everywhere because of the
nurseries and how how hype strains kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: were pushed in and there were demands for
specific strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: It spread like wildfire, wildfire and in
Spain now, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we don't have that as much in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: New York State's not one of the big,
big hubs of growing with nurseries and
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: California, Oregon, Colorado, Washington,
Spain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Amsterdam's been ravaged recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Belgium.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's all over now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long are we going to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And disease, disease is just because
disease evolves too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see it in COVID and then we have
the Delta and then we have the Omicron and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we have, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also you are changing and the
virus is changing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would recommend in that case is
have a good tissue culture facility where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do tissue culture and you can
assure that your stock is clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is is hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that breeding is is another good
thing when you have actual males and
[SPEAKER_01]: females that you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yes, again, you have to do the
phenol hunting and then it takes several
[SPEAKER_01]: generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have two siblings that are
nothing alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to grow however many
hundreds of thousands of seeds to look for
[SPEAKER_01]: that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the one that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you go and as you're doing
inbreeding, right, parents and offspring
[SPEAKER_01]: or full sibs, then you get better traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but in terms of of disease,
I think that the best thing that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have is diversity is as much variation as
possible, because then if you have full
[SPEAKER_01]: sibs, maybe these two are affected by the
virus, but maybe these two are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that regarding disease, but there's
other traits that I think an albinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe terpenes, there's other traits that
I know that people are looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time genes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that we may have genetic tools
available sooner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that would that would be so cool
because, you know, I mean, flowering time
[SPEAKER_07]: is a serious determiner of probably as
best we can tell high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's certain highs that you can
get from 18 week flowering plant from
[SPEAKER_07]: Colombia that you can't get from a eight
week flowering plants from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see that that played with a
bunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything else in breeding in
cannabis that has totally blown your mind
[SPEAKER_07]: that you found like that was quite
unexpected once you started looking at the
[SPEAKER_07]: genes?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quite unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the cannabinoid genes, it was,
you know, it's so cool because at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning we thought that it was one gene
with two different alleles, like with two
[SPEAKER_01]: different forms of a gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that if you were dominant for one,
then you produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were dominant for the other one
that you produce THC and then if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were homozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You produce THC homozygous for the other
allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: You produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you were heterozygous,
then you produce both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we found out that there are
multiple genes related to cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: production, multiple, and that individuals
differ in the number of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we found that out, I remember,
I remember the day that we found this out
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was doing the genome alignment and I
was looking at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my lab mate at the time,
who's now a good friend and collaborator,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kyle, he was the one that was like,
this doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at these alignments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we found out that there were
actually different genes and there were
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple genes that were very similar to
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we found out that, yes,
indeed, there are different copies,
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals differ in these different
copies, but these genes are in close
[SPEAKER_01]: proximity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm working on this paper that I
hope to have published by 2023 that we now
[SPEAKER_01]: see that there are multiple genes for
example, for CBC production, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bunch of genes related to CBC
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is CBC produced in such little
quantities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's so many genes related to CBC
production, like that is a question that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my hypothesis is that, you know,
like these enzymes, we know that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They act like the same precursor molecule,
which is CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're sloppy because they produce
each other's scums.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce the same compounds and they
are promiscuous because they act on CBGA,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same precursor molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not very accurate at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hypothesis is that CBCA synthase,
so this enzyme that is producing CBCA is
[SPEAKER_01]: producing everything else except for CBC,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's producing everything else because the
genes are so abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, independent if you're a hamfer
fiber and grain or independent if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana type or you're a CBGA type of
plant, independent of that, everyone has a
[SPEAKER_01]: CBCA gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are those guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're partying.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_07]: And are there other cannabinoids that
exist in cannabis that like we may not
[SPEAKER_07]: even know about that may be more important
in the high factor than we even know or
[SPEAKER_07]: anything that exists like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but you know, the terpenes
are produced in very low quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have, for example, that for THC,
you have 28% by dry weight or even 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: even 35% by dry weight while you see,
for example, for mercy and it's like 5% or
[SPEAKER_01]: 3%, but it still smells.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some things that are even the
part per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're really tiny amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not that affects your high,
I don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's something that we do
desperately need to do in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is to do controlled studies
without you knowing what you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the exact chemo type of this joint
or whatever chemo type we know because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're discovering this THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe there's another cannabinoid that
we had not calibrated the LBLC,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemists do not hate me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe what I just said was completely
stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But OK, we measure the chemo type and then
we give it to you and do Matthew smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: this and tell me what you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can we can take blood before and
afterwards, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then blinded study that you don't know
what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can do it with however many
hundreds of people, different different
[SPEAKER_01]: joints with different chemo types.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that people do not know what they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they tell us, OK, this is what I
felt on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate ice left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that for alcohol, if you're
depressed or if you're if you ate,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that there's a difference in in
how drunk you get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women and men, we know that there's a
difference in alcohol in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we do have some suggestions that there
are differences between women and men.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know if you ate, if you
slept, if you exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I going to feel the same with this
joint today than on Friday?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's no way to quantify it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need those studies, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with with the laws in place currently,
we cannot do those studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Federally?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, federally we cannot, but we could do
them in in in states, in in regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: states and in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my I have some papers with her,
Cinnamon Bidwell, collaborator of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has the canavan and in the canavan,
she goes to places because she cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: bring people on campus and have them go
get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she goes in the van and then she takes
up blood before you consume it and after
[SPEAKER_01]: you consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what she tells you is just consume it
as you are normally going to consume
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then she takes blood and she does
some sort of cognitive tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there's short term memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she does, you know, remember,
try to memorize this grocery store list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like that before and after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so she has done something like that,
but we don't know with particular chemo
[SPEAKER_01]: types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, for you to measure those
chemo types, you have to go to a reputable
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some labs that are not that
reputable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some that are.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so those particular labs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's that's that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I think you wouldn't find a
shortage of people wanting to do that,
[SPEAKER_07]: like willing to give their blood to just
go get baked and give results.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think science, it would be super fun,
but from the researcher's perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do need a lot of paperwork in order to
be able to do that, even to give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I'm not touching you, just give
you the questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge amount of paperwork and
stuff that you have to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine taking blood like all that
stuff would be so much paperwork to even
[SPEAKER_07]: be able to do that on people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then why are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm getting people high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, is there anything else you want to
talk about before we finish up?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk about your nonprofit again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we mention what it's called?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Agricultural Genomics Foundation AGF
and the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I put it here in the in the chat?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll type it out right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can put it in the chat and I can
cut and paste it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculturalgenomics.org.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can paste it over right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the name of the nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do a lot of public outreach through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to educate the public through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also do consulting as a side gig.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find me on social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's your Twitter name?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Atkana Vakana.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me go over here just so we can get it
on there, because I know everybody's going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on LinkedIn, I also use LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see my LinkedIn profile,
because we don't know if Twitter is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, through Elon?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, nobody knows yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nobody knows whether Twitter is
going to be a thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is that LinkedIn seems so boring
sometimes?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've never even signed up for
LinkedIn in my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I just never done it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's supposed to be a professional
Facebook, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have been I accept everyone on
LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, do you want to be my friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But LinkedIn lately has been good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do consulting and I have found several
gigs through LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's accomplished its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to hear me rant
politically, like I did to Matthew today,
[SPEAKER_04]: then I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just cannot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you not be political in this
climate right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: My family was United Farmworkers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm hardcore like, you know,
union, you know, social programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that why it's called the syndicate?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is the overall goal with the
syndicate when I originally came up with
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like a pie in the sky idea where
I want to take it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of these people that came before
me don't like even me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have retirement programs for any
of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seen a lot of people that laid
the foundation for this industry just be
[SPEAKER_07]: run over.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're having the hardest time.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're having to find new jobs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are people who deserve
recognition and have earned their place in
[SPEAKER_07]: our society.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I'd love to make it some kind of
union kind of deal where there's
[SPEAKER_07]: retirement plans, medical plans,
you know, things like that for people in
[SPEAKER_07]: the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just a pie in the sky idea
because I don't know a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_07]: would be into putting their hard time,
work and money into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll keep putting my work in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see that there was a video that
came out recently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding the cannabis industry in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether whether you watched
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me let me see if I if I find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but they they they have Steve D'Angelo
and I think it's super interesting because
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that California kind of did it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Steve D'Angelo is nobody's like at
least from our point of view, like the the
[SPEAKER_07]: hardcore people like Steve D'Angelo has
never been someone that any of us are
[SPEAKER_07]: like, yeah, I want to see that dude do
well because he was the first to bring in
[SPEAKER_07]: corporate push it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when he found out he wasn't rich
enough to play ball with the big boys
[SPEAKER_07]: recently, he's like, yeah, I shouldn't
have done Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, well, then why did you push
it, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: You ruined a lot of people's lives in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: My friends are now out of out of work and
hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I think you should watch that that
YouTube video because he does talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like he does talk about Prop 64
and and how California kind of did it
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong in that in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I find it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a good is that my kid watches
videos also in my thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then I get, you know, like I know what
you mean.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your history gets all twisted up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all all like my kid watching a stupid
toy video.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I think the hardest part for me
with Steve D'Angelo is that we were the
[SPEAKER_07]: group like our friends were the group that
was pushing back against him when we were
[SPEAKER_07]: saying, hey, guy, this isn't going to
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to screw a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he put so much money and hate behind
it to push back against us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end, he realized, oh,
I don't get to play ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not I'm not a multi trillionaire like
these people that are going to own
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't like what I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we all saw that long before he did.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he fought against us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, yeah, we get you don't see
it now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they would let you play ball,
you probably would have.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's the way I look at it with
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very disingenuous fellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just you know, I've never understood
really California in general, because
[SPEAKER_01]: California is as big as Colombia,
almost in population, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: California has, I don't know, 45 million
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia has 50 million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an entire country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really understand why California
doesn't secede from the US.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which it's the fourth largest economy in
the world, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fourth or sixth, but around there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so the just the state of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it's going on in California when you
talk about, Steve, it's so different from
[SPEAKER_01]: the information that we get around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is called it's a it's a Forbes
documentary documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to put it here in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forbes and it's called How America Watched
Cannabis Legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was released five days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I watched it this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's an interesting take.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I think that the documentary
should be how California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what's going on in the other
states is complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: California is the biggest market in the
entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's going on here in New York,
it's very different from what happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very different from what's going
on in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I think that that we have to keep
that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I totally recommend this documentary.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was looking at like early on in
California, when it was first going legal
[SPEAKER_07]: with two fifteen, what I saw was like
stuff in Amsterdam where they had bed
[SPEAKER_07]: recon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it started out as like, you know,
there were there were shops.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of a sudden you couldn't grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you can't sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one corporation was able to take it
over and get the the main thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I saw in Israel, you know,
like the same kind of stuff happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw in Canada started going that way,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in California, with the Prop 64,
everybody was kind of like, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's looking like it's going to be too
expensive for any of the legacy farmers to
[SPEAKER_07]: own any licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we couldn't even afford to buy the
equipment to surveil ourselves with the
[SPEAKER_07]: cameras, let alone, you know, afford to
run a business and make money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Off that when the guy down the street is
is quadrupling the production on us and
[SPEAKER_07]: able to charge and able to run at a loss
for 10 years, whereas we're small farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't run at a loss for a year,
let alone 10.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they know that they can wipe out the
market that way and and drive everyone
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Israel is very governmentally
controlled, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is different because you can get
corporations that are multibillion dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: corporations where you have, you know,
a guy just spend billions of dollars in a
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because there is no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The capitalism here is going to an
extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I do think that you need some
sort of governmental regulations in some
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the problem of California
was that there may have been too much
[SPEAKER_01]: governmental regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that you're requiring the legal
industry to operate at a loss compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The illicit market must not but must not
test as thoroughly the illicit market does
[SPEAKER_01]: not have to have the packaging that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that you're operating at a loss
due to those particular laws and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, which is something that New
York state, for example, different from
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is not as regulated as California
or New York state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in New York state is kind of like,
hey, do not make people test like make him
[SPEAKER_01]: test as you would test for a tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to consume the tomato and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want apple picking three weeks ago,
two weeks ago, and I took an apple from
[SPEAKER_01]: the tree and I ate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure that there were some living
organism in that apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure what it didn't kill me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had I smoked that apple, I think that I
would still not be dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope that there's a time where
anywhere in anywhere that people just
[SPEAKER_07]: don't settle for like and I feel like that
was the attitude with with Prop 64 and 215
[SPEAKER_07]: for that matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they're finally going to give us a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we just take what we can get now
and maybe fight for more later?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I've learned, like just in all
laws is like they don't really give you
[SPEAKER_07]: what they aren't willing to lose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're not willing to lose more
than that, you're never going to get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what what benefits whoever is in
power and can pay the pay the piper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I do think that there are some
people that are in power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are actually looking for the best for
their people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do understand that some people are
in power and it's like I have the power
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm the king.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that there are some people who
are in power there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, hey, let's build something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think elections are so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that many of the laws and
regulations, for example, regarding the
[SPEAKER_01]: zero point three percent THC, like I
always why didn't they ask me about that
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation, which makes no sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is going to get high on a zero point
eight THC fiber hemp when you go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary and you have a ninety eight
percent concentrate?
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes no sense at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did they consult for these kind of
laws?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know who they consulted for these
kind of laws?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some regulations here in
New York state that are kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, you have never grown a plant before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're limiting the acreage size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are you determining?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have do you have a houseplant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a plant living in your living
room?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some regulations that are just,
you know, a guide decided.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lawyer that knew how to write laws
decided.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a long way to go, but I'm really
excited about the future, especially as it
[SPEAKER_07]: comes to science with breeding,
because I'm such a I'm such a nerd when it
[SPEAKER_07]: comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I love the idea, whether it's
whether it's your successful or successive
[SPEAKER_07]: generations and breeding in a trait or
whether it's being able to eliminate a
[SPEAKER_07]: trait completely that has no beneficial
anything to what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That helps that helps breeding that helps
us make our projects with successive
[SPEAKER_07]: generations even easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm super stoked to see what you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd be really excited to work with you
on any level on that in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really appreciate you taking your
time tonight to come and hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for being with me in a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have you back soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm excited to one because my job in
extension in Cornell is very related to
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that I get to do that with on site
with with with cannabis farmers and hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: as well, you know, for grain and hopefully
for grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that I get to do that here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that breeding that's going to
be the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be yet, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm excited that we're also having
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for having me.
