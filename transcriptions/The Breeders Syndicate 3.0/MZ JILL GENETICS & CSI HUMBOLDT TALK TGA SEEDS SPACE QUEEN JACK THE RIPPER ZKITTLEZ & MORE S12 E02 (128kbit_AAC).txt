[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get started, I just wanted to
let you know that over at riotseeds.com,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're about to drop some new goat farm
gear, some of the last of the Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_03]: Feminize Hybrids, and we have the whole
Blue in Cross lineup, Blue IX.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm calling it Blue 9, but it's Blue
IX, Blue in Cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's half off right now,
so talking $100 and $80 a pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be sure to go check that out at
riotseeds.com, and we have some high and
[SPEAKER_03]: lonesome stuff still.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some stuff from Mad Elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check it out while it's still going.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sale's probably going to end in about
a week and a half, so keep your eyes
[SPEAKER_03]: peeled on riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matt, today here with Inspecta and the
lovely Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, we're going to be talking about the
reemergence of TGA seeds, what it means,
[SPEAKER_03]: what it was, where it's going now,
and yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the two involved in it,
and I think they're coming out with some
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty amazing new hybrids with the Space
Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So real quick, Miss Jill, if you can give
us a quick synopsis of TGA.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did TGA stand for originally?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, what does TGA stand for,
and what was the purpose?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Green Avenger or the Green Avengers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the purpose of overgrowing the
planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: As everyone together, it was the Green
Avengers, and then we were the Green
[SPEAKER_05]: Avengers separately on our own,
but as a whole, we would be considered the
[SPEAKER_05]: Green Avengers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was our goal to overgrow the planet
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long would you say that it ran as a
company?
[SPEAKER_03]: When did it start, and when did it slowly
go back towards Miss Jill genetics?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say, I believe TGA started in
2001.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a slow start.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started with Cannabis World on the
auctions, actually, and we were selling
[SPEAKER_05]: packs at $5, and they were getting
returned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: As time went on, we grew in popularity,
and people started growing out the
[SPEAKER_05]: strains, and they really liked what they
were getting, and the cannabis movement
[SPEAKER_05]: started booming.
[SPEAKER_05]: People started realizing what great
medicine it was, and we just took off from
[SPEAKER_05]: there, and we were going very strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: We moved to California, and we were doing
really well, and then we had a fire in
[SPEAKER_05]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was October 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of took everything we had,
all of our moms, and thankfully,
[SPEAKER_05]: we still had some moms with different
people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seb and I both split up and went our
different ways at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were doing business together,
and I ended up taking TGA and making Miss
[SPEAKER_05]: Jill TGA genetics, and Seb went off and
done his own thing with subcool seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where we went.
[SPEAKER_03]: During the time at TGA, there was a bunch
of people involved other than just you and
[SPEAKER_03]: Seb, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There were other people that were helping
with the collaborative effort of putting
[SPEAKER_03]: these strains out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, several other breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they've made their own name over
time because of the work they did with TGA
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, which is, I think, notable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some really amazing stuff.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said, I wanted to go over some
of your guys' best hits as TGA early on,
[SPEAKER_03]: and one of the first ones that comes to
mind is Jax Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember necessarily the genetics
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, what, NL5, Pluton?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lamb spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was in the Pluton, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then they said like purple haze,
I think, at the very end or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember, Caleb?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it had way too many things in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a lot in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Pluton from, I think, was SSSC,
Pluton?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not certain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that one had like lamb's bread,
all kinds of stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jax Cleaner that Seb had before we had
met.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a combination of something
called the Cleaner, too, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that something different?
[SPEAKER_05]: Jax Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Jax Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Jax Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, some of the other big hits like Jack
the Ripper obviously came from Jax
Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you know what the parentage of that
one was?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe it was Space Queen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so one of the first Space Queen
ones, Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that became a huge hit for you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Jack the Ripper and then Jelly Bean
after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was in Jelly Bean?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Orange Velvet, which was
originally named Melvin.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it came to me, I got it from some
patients in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the rumor was they had gotten it from
someone in Fall City, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had been around for 25 years at the
time I got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be moving up on about 50 years
old now at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old ass plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did you like about the Melvin
when you first saw it?
[SPEAKER_05]: She was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to rename her because Melvin just
seems like such a silly name for such a
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: She turned the most beautiful colors,
almost black, burgundy black.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looked like velvet.
[SPEAKER_05]: The leaves looked like velvet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she smelled super orangey.
[SPEAKER_05]: About three weeks into flowering,
you start walking into the grove and at
[SPEAKER_05]: first it starts smelling like a little bit
like burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as it goes on, you get that real
strong orange smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was great for bag appeal until
you've had too much of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only talk so much orange that
strong for a long before you start getting
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit tired of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an extreme orange and it bred well
for its orange traits.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those other plants would be
Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the first TGA strains that
I had tried was the Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had like an orange soda,
like orange crust soda type expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was crossed with Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was Jack the Ripper and the
Melvin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or orange velvet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think Melvin's a great name
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have down here Sputnik one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that was that big of a hit
or it was mostly a hit because it was in
[SPEAKER_03]: books and it was so pink.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that mainly it was a big hit over
the color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seemed to be a little bit airy and a
little more sativa leaning.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was absolutely beautiful and it did
have a great flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's Danny Boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that being a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember it being very lemony.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taco, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Tega C99.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was the taco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have stuff like the Quirkle.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you tell us about the original
Quirkle?
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a purple Urkel plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time it came to us, it was called
Lavender.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was given to us by a kid named Sticky
Lungs.
[SPEAKER_05]: When he was living in Oregon, it was a kid
from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still actually speak to him
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where it originally came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then over time, I guess we figured out
that it was a purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not certain on the lineage of it if it
was actually a Lavender or a purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the purple Urkel that I'm using now
for Quirkle is actually a purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a change.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do still have to offer Quirkle,
but the mom is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still utilizes Space Dude for the male.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a reliable selection of
purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Chernobyl was a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one that I liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a very lime soda type of stuff to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know this story on... What was the
blood wreck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Blood wreck was a phenotype of train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that came via dioxide and came through
another guy named Scotty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had given it to dioxide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we used it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Golden Ticket... Well,
let's start out with the Golden Ticket
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the phenotype was found by Danny from
Uplifted Farms during testing period
[SPEAKER_05]: before it was ever a release train.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just a wonderful, very limey
type flavor with just a ton of resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kept that around and used that later
in life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got that as mother of my Jilly Bean
Lime.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got that available both regular
and feminized.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But later on, the clone fell into the
hands of... I'm not going to mention
[SPEAKER_05]: names, but he wasn't supposed to have the
clone and he decided to name it Slimer so
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know... Does he have a lame
little mustache?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that that person?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he renamed the Golden Ticket to Slimer
on his own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a phenotype of Golden... I mean,
I'm sorry, of Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, let's get into Mr. Inspector here,
which I know everybody's stoked to see his
[SPEAKER_03]: smiling, beautiful face back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to talk a little bit about the
ideas behind bringing TGA back and what
[SPEAKER_03]: direction you wanted to bring some of your
moms in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You and Jill obviously talked at a
collaborative effort and figured out which
[SPEAKER_03]: moms in your room would work best with the
Space Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk about what some of your ideas were
behind some of these streams you guys got
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I grew... I think it was Jesus OG or
Jesus OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wasn't that like a Hell's Angel OG
Cross to Space Dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew that back in the day and,
you know, those plants just had amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor and just, you know, it seemed like
there was a lot of really good traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed forward on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured based on that, you know,
it would probably hybridize pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, some of these,
you know, oddballs and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: heirlooms that, you know, we all have in
our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that was my main draw to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were some of the first ideas that you
had, you know, when you were thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about what would cross well with Space
Dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, definitely like,
you know, Chem D, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different OGs, some of the worked OGs,
you know, like 5150.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, even stuff,
you know, that wasn't around back when TGA
[SPEAKER_00]: was making, you know, Space Dude hybrids,
like, you know, Skittles and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that, you know, even Girl Scout
cookies, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, definitely bring some of the
old into, you know, in with the new.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you come up with any... Oh,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Jill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm one of those that really loves
cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really happy to have that cross
with Space Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to make something
really pretty.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had Space Queen mom that you kept,
Jill.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did she smell like and look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: We originally started with two Space Queen
moms that we used for seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them was referred to as Tiny Bomb
and was a phenotype that I chose before
[SPEAKER_05]: they had ever flowered just based on
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she ended up being an amazing plant,
great structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Space Bomb, she had just,
or Tiny Bomb, she had just, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the bud was just a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally figured out over time that we
just vegged her a little bit longer than
[SPEAKER_05]: she would just have, you know,
beautiful thick buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the beginning, they had started out
really small.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we had called her Tiny
Bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so we had both of those phenotypes and
we were offering seeds from both.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one was a Space Jill and then one was
Space Bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after time, we got rid of the Space
Jill because it was more, it was bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you know, nicer crop, but it was
as resinous and flavorful as the Space
[SPEAKER_05]: Bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just super strong cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of my most favorites to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just super resinous and super cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just fabulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, did the Space Dude male, do you know
if it ever passed forward stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: cherry or is it usually just tropical
fruit type stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does he like to pass or tend to pass?
[SPEAKER_05]: He does want some cherry, but for the most
part, why he's been one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: males is he lets the female express
herself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still get the expression of whatever
female you crossed him to with just a
[SPEAKER_05]: little more hint of maybe a little cherry
or a little more resin.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Tiny Bomb was really,
really resinous too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Short little resinous thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that said, which ones are you most
looking forward to out of the new stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: Caleb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, definitely like the Chem
D, Girl Scouts, the different Skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: Z85.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those ones probably are top on
my list.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in the HP 13 one quite a
bit just because it's that mystery clone
[SPEAKER_03]: that no one's allowed to touch,
see, smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will be really unique too,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the combination with the Space
Dude will up its frost content and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably normalize some of that HP 13
weirdness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you did do some stuff with GDP as well
and Purple Urkel, which obviously that's
[SPEAKER_03]: one that was already established,
but with the GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of interesting that you did
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focused on the GDP just because it seems
to be a more refined type of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get Chem 91 in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a Calio in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got the Calio in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be interesting to see how it
compares to like the Orange Velvet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Julie's Twisted Sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've named that strain Julie's Twisted
Sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good name for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got Lemon Party in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon Party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Irene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene will be a great one, I think too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very, very, very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you said, Triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got a bunch of OGs in there and the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you do any other types?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookie types in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The F1 Derb or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that one got in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not, I didn't make too many seeds of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one could be really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be all over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that you guys have done,
you know, some red work with the Space
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, have you thought about doing any
feminized works?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what you're known for,
Mr. Inspector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually here, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do you think you would go for
feminized wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would most interest you from the TGA
catalog to pull feminized work out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Jill and I have been talking and
probably possibly Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do some work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some orangey work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell me a little bit about Ms. Jill
genetics and what you've been doing aside
[SPEAKER_03]: from the Space Dude stuff, the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do you have going on over there,
Jill?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of Jilly Bean hybrids and
they're not just different phenotypes of
[SPEAKER_05]: Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope people aren't confused by that
because I have like a Jilly Bean Black
[SPEAKER_05]: Cherry, Jilly Bean Cherry, Jilly Bean
Grape, Jilly Bean Lime.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Mendo Jilly and Joker's Wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of those are available regular and
feminized.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hits both sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people prefer regulars and some
people don't have the room and prefer
[SPEAKER_05]: feminize.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm trying to offer for both both
sides of the fence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I'm just really excited for all
of the new Space Queen crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still working on getting some of
those out ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next, like Caleb was saying,
we have the Agent Orange coming up next.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Caleb, what about you with CSI
Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you got going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm scaling back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you do work a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a workaholic, whether you admit it
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I admit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what have you been focusing on lately?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any big wins in the way of surprises in
the way of the seeds coming out soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm crossing my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I get a reverse on Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that anybody, you know, wanted any of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly to complete the catalog and,
you know, yeah, preserve the last of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chems that, you know, are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you have some NL5 FEMS too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a backlog of stuff I need to sort
and process.
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes to he doesn't he likes to blow
seeds, but he doesn't like to blow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you got you have some other stuff,
though, coming down the pipe, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other feminized work that you haven't
released yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nothing you're wanting to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing too excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I have so much stuff in
the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get along with.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, how about reg work?
[SPEAKER_03]: You doing any reg work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, you know, the space dude is,
I think, the most recent reg stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really, you know, been doing a
whole lot of reg work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I am doing a round of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bastard missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biscuits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time's Australian bastards.
[SPEAKER_00]: F4s I think I'm working into now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, you're going to you're going to
select any out and reverse those and try
[SPEAKER_03]: to make a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got it like a 80, 90 plant run
inside and then almost 170 outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's definitely some
interesting ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a lot of people missed out on the
Aussie bastard stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool looking and very
unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people need to get on that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it needs a lot of work, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, can't blame them too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what else do you excited about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else there, Mr. C?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm excited for a vacation here
shortly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gonna go Australia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a nice ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you go, I'm coming with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm broke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Miss Jill, other than the stuff going
on right now, anything you're excited
[SPEAKER_03]: about or anything you want to tell people
where where they can get these?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a list of vendors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find that on my web page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I need to pick up some more because my
ass has been lagging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need to get everything updated on the
site.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are on the website on my website and
also on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look in the story highlights,
there's a list of vendors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: New ones like the Kim Queen and the Lemon
Space Party, those have already been
[SPEAKER_05]: released.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess five new ones and the Space
Queen F3 and the Jilly's Twisted Sister,
[SPEAKER_05]: those are already available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we get those back, get those out to
you, because I know we need to get that
[SPEAKER_05]: done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can also contact me direct if
needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will be talking to the lovely Miss
Jill, everyone, in case you didn't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: she does respond personally because she's
sweet like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I know you guys got stuff to do,
but I wanted to make sure and get the word
[SPEAKER_03]: out on all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I appreciate both of your times.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anything else you want to get
in, get it in now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I brought this this book out to
share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, let's see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was written by Eric Nugshots and his
partner that he worked with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
Damn Michaels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric, whenever he's at conventions and he
has this little wheel thing that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: turn and watch the buds spin, I always see
like 90 people lined up to do that shit
[SPEAKER_03]: because it looks so pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And which one's this?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anybody's interested in this book,
I'm not certain where you can pick it up
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's on Amazon, I want to say
on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can get it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do have an email if if they want to
contact you later and get that if they
[SPEAKER_05]: need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the Space Queen,
the start of TGA, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a Space Queen female.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a female.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is actually not our photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, it's from BCGA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a gorgeous book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have that in my collection yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Eric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also, of course, Dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that there's a 2.0 of this book
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only own 1.0, so I don't know what the
changes exactly were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember, Jill, the changes from
one to two?
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one was a hardcover.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you touched it, it felt like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but the 2.0 just it's more strains
updated.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so it was just more of what you had
released between one and two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ed Rosenthal actually is the one who
edited and produced all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a good job.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we've come a long way with
photography since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we were just talking about
Sputnik.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's Sputnik.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see why people liked it so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful pink.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like magenta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was that was really new back
then.
[SPEAKER_05]: People weren't used to having those
colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of people don't realize
that like that purple craze that came and
[SPEAKER_03]: went with with the Urkels and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't really seeing pretty magenta
stuff like that that often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you agree with that, Caleb?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you know that was more in like the
Mendo perps?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a Trollkush style plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel is, you know, coal dependent or
environmental dependent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one's that basically?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is that now that's one of your guys is
Space Queens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that Space Jill?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the Space Jill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Tiny Bomb has its own page in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can really when I look at this
structure, I could see it in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just looking at a picture of Plush
very recently that looked just like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here is the Tiny Bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is it was it was pretty small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, was Tiny Bomb and Space Jill both
kind of cherryish or did they have their
[SPEAKER_03]: own distinct sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: They were they were cherry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say Space Jill is more cherry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The infamous Space Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Responsible for nutting all over the
Caleb's moms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice balls, son.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is back before people were really
getting this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can really see this picture right
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue coming off and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sub always did have really good pictures
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he always the one taking the pictures,
too?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we both did.
[SPEAKER_05]: With functionality of the camera,
like he knew how to set the settings on
[SPEAKER_05]: the camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't or the one who would set in the
auto mode, but I was much better at
[SPEAKER_05]: setting up shots.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That collaborative effort with your guys's
pictures is pretty legendary, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember on Breed Bay, a lot of people
trying to emulate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did get a lot of magazine covers and
articles with my photography, and so did
[SPEAKER_05]: he.
[SPEAKER_05]: We both did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite part of the TGA era was you
guys on Breed Bay, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when you guys hit your stride
big, I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here is an old High Times magazine
from, is it May of 2007?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: May of 2007.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's on the cover?
[SPEAKER_05]: First article I had written for High
Times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a picture of the orange velvet,
and the article was the orange wave,
[SPEAKER_05]: the female grower's perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the whole start of the orange
craze that we got into the industry with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be doing more stuff like that
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: More orange?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, more articles, talking about stuff
from the female grower's perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: just because, I mean, you're a fine
representative of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, unfortunately, with High Times,
the crew has all changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably about 2016 through 2018,
they kind of got rid of their original
[SPEAKER_05]: crew, and they've gone with a new crew,
a bunch of younger people, which,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they're trying to hit the
younger crowd.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do understand that, but they're not
so much interested in the breeders or the
[SPEAKER_05]: growers anymore, more of influencers and
because the industry has become legalized,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so people are more into the instant
gratification.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just walk into a dispensary and
grab what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't carry the heart that it
carries when you grow your own.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really wish more people would get
into growing their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so therapeutic to grow and to touch
the plants and have your hands in the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's rewarding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so surprising, you know, you grow
this little plant and it just grows into
[SPEAKER_05]: this big, beautiful plant and you have
these buds on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes it's just the satisfaction
of knowing that you've just created
[SPEAKER_05]: something so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you get to cure it and smoke it
and reap the benefits of all your hard
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you always know what you put in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you're not smoking whatever,
you're not getting the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's a lot of testing,
but a lot of stuff still slips through on
[SPEAKER_05]: the testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned about how they dip it in
hydrogen peroxide now to beat the testing
[SPEAKER_03]: and sometimes irradiate, which was new to
me, that they irradiate the weed to beat
[SPEAKER_03]: testing X-ray style, which is new to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to call any names out, but,
you know, the guy SK initials,
[SPEAKER_05]: he was part of a group that has it's
called a remediation machine or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they were growing weed that would
be moldy or subpar, something they
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't sell, couldn't pass testing,
they would put it through the remediation
[SPEAKER_05]: machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you have to worry about
those kinds of things, especially if you
[SPEAKER_05]: buy the pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not getting buds that have been
broken up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, not even sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting families.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting whatever is at the bottom
of the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's something to say for,
like, seeing people grow something out
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've made.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with seed wise, I think all of
us could agree that's something really
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you first start seeing that as
someone who makes seeds, it's a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: nother feeling.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to see their excitement and joy when
they grow it out and it's beautiful and
[SPEAKER_05]: they feel like they've done such a great
job and they smoke it for the first time
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're so happy and excited with
their work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to see your medicine help
people with physical or mental issues and
[SPEAKER_05]: help them overcome things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, the growing itself is
therapeutic and definitely helps people
[SPEAKER_05]: with anxiety and depression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always know when I'm depressed,
if my plants don't look good, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: always a very good physical indicator of
how my brain's doing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get depressed and my plants are
unhappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perverse.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happened that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when rooms fucking,
you know, fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depressing as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: About that is, you know, you get to learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: You figure out what it is that you've done
wrong, what you could have done
[SPEAKER_05]: differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the thing about growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't write a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can write a book about
growing, but you can't write down
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that might come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always going to be different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's environment, every strain and
every year might even be different.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some rounds where I can't even
clone, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I feel like I'm an idiot
and have to start back from scratch on
[SPEAKER_03]: just cloning, but usually it lasts a month
out of the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, maybe if you really paid
attention to that, it might be the same
[SPEAKER_05]: same time of year every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be something else going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like mercury retrograde.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like mercury, that motherfucking mercury
retrograde gets me every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we have rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: My clones are unrooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unrooting, reverse rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have your website.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it, Mr. Inspector?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think it's like HumboldtCSI.com
Humboldt CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: CSI Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: CSI.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms. Jill, what's your website?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms. Jill.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms. Jill.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Jill Ms. .com.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can get there through TGAgenetics
.com, Ms. Jillgenetics.com as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're looking to pick up some new
gear, Ms. Jillclothing.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the sexy Ms. Jill clothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's half off right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the coffee cups, the shirts,
hoodies, dab mats, there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: cool things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have women's size shirts like the
one you're wearing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that one of your Ms. Jill shirts?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're all black and they say Ms.
Jill on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it wouldn't be cool to rock your
own shirt, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I often do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send you one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice low cut number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little nice big dipping V neck for
my chest hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You too, CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hide the V neck with my beard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you'll have a Santa Claus hat on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, I want to thank you guys so
much for showing up and turning out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a pleasure to speak to both of
you and hopefully we'll see both of you
[SPEAKER_03]: back again very soon.
