than the prison wall It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just shows what you can spend
on yourself When you don't have children,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you could buy yourself all kinds of
figurines Yeah, someone asked about resin
[SPEAKER_02]: lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I texted him two days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: No response yet He likes to go away and
disappear for a long period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly one of the weirdest dudes I've
ever met He does he does like to you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hate Hibernate not not everyone
has the easiest time with Socialization
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that you know, yeah and in fact I
will say too that like a lot of breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: and growers and all that kind of stuff
like it You know at some at sometimes like
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be somewhat used to isolation
Yeah, you know you spend a lot of time
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of alone Yeah, you know, I mean,
yeah, it's I miss him dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's so funny I know we all miss him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, hopefully he'll come back
sometime Yeah, it would be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but that a lot of times that's
weed people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know they flow in and out,
you know, sometimes you only have so much
[SPEAKER_00]: energy for socialization Yeah,
you know the desire to be public You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah somebody said pandemic same thing for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pandemic was easy I'll spend a lot of time
alone and you know, yeah But for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are super social, you know,
I mean there's a lot of people that can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even be quiet Yeah, you know they get they
have to have music on or they have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: someone talking because it's like they're
just not Used to yeah, so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like someone accidentally got
blocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, whoever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't unblock you I'd have to stop the
show to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah Yeah, Matt on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does he have a quick block
finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a fat Accidental block thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do I do the problem is like when people
say shit in here They don't want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: rid of I go to click it and I'll go to hit
boot But sometimes it'll scroll up when I
[SPEAKER_02]: go to do it and I do it so fast that it's
just Like boom and then I told I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I'm trying to remember stuff and
answer quite and then I'm like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even remember who I did it to but before
before Like we jump into like what the
[SPEAKER_00]: show is actually about well, you know
Maybe I'll add one comment on to that
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that the whole thing about like I
see a lot of people commenting on like How
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of liked the kovat lockdowns
because it fit their lifestyle,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or like they're cared for it You
know, there's a lot of us who are kind Of
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in for a long time that like the
way you stayed safe was like you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: tight group of friends that knew What
you're up to and you stayed quiet and you
[SPEAKER_00]: kept your head down and you tried to be
invisible Yeah, and I actually do think
[SPEAKER_00]: that played a massive and you know And
then there's a whole thing of like some
[SPEAKER_00]: people like the plants more than people
You know and people had weird quirks and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know One of the things that cannabis
allowed was like your weird quirks to get
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger Yeah, because you could self
sustain whether it was seeds or flowers Or
[SPEAKER_00]: hustling or whatever it might be,
you know, and a lot of times like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know real jobs and stuff They sand
those edges Yeah, and so we get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: quirky people in weed and then when the
money came into weed Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the here's the point I wanted to
make when the money came into weed the
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority of the like slightly
Invisible suspicious weed people sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: hid and took like a waiting wait and see
kind of attitude towards what was going on
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right, which meant like all the
super social hustler bullshitty type
[SPEAKER_00]: people They all ran to the capital first
because that's what they wanted was money
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah money and rap and all this different
stuff and said all of a sudden there was
[SPEAKER_00]: like minor weed celebrities and you know
and this and that and everything else and
[SPEAKER_00]: so as a result like a lot all the people
that all the money partnered with first
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't like the deep breeders and the
people pulling off real shit and the
[SPEAKER_00]: People that grew exceptional flower and
all that it was like all the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: were like You know that they were
socially, you know, they just ran towards
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were connected They have rich parents
or rich brother or you know some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: media whatever and So it's kind of been
fucked up and that like a lot of the like
[SPEAKER_00]: the faces of cannabis Like they're not the
heart of the scene No, I mean that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a given like a lot of these
corporate guys where they made the mistake
[SPEAKER_02]: and investors they made the mistake in
thinking that they could walk into a black
[SPEAKER_02]: market and talk to it talk to the deepest
dudes in the deepest circles because
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, those are the guys on high
times covers and winning cups Obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: those are the guys that are the deep ones
in the deep circles I mean, you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of they kind of screwed each other
and in the process they lit a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money on fire because a lot of the capital
like Sharkey rich people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know partnering with some of some
terrible people in the industry each party
[SPEAKER_00]: was trying to Screw the other Yeah,
like the weed hustlers were trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of money from the rich people and
the rich people were trying to like steal
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and SOP and then kick the fucking
hustlers out Yeah, only like the hustlers
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't do what they they couldn't they
couldn't set up Actual large scenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: run them efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no heart for a long time They
didn't understand all that different
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they sort of learned on the rich
people's dot dying Yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, like if if someone would have
came to me and said hey, you know I know
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been doing this X amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to scale up and I want you to
run this fucking massive facility I
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't have been able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mean scaling up is a hard fucking
thing It takes a certain kind of brain to
[SPEAKER_02]: go from being able to blow up houses to
blowing up fucking major facilities It is
[SPEAKER_00]: not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same thing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not necessarily I mean the
one thing that does translate is that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a good pot grower and you're
observant of the plant That helps because
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps you find tune whatever the fuck
is going on with your greenhouse or your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor your room or wherever you might be
growing weed, you know, but certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and you know and then the other part
of it too is like Like everybody agrees
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's craft weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but nobody agrees where craft stops
Yeah You know like so so that way
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody gets to claim craft Yeah You
know you have people with a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter claiming craft you have people
with acres claiming craft You have people
[SPEAKER_00]: with a ten thousand squids, you know,
it's all they're all growing the fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep Yeah, I was I was watching a video
earlier today and I mentioned it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was people growing aquaponics on a
large scale for a major Retailer in Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: and they were just they were growing games
in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the first times I've ever
seen that So yeah, I did all that 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago and it's it's because it's actually
like it's Fit what I was it's hydro but
[SPEAKER_00]: with fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, kind of but it's organically,
you know So it's like if you get it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's very hard to find really
Quality like exceptional quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: grown aquaponically because it's so hard
with the inputs You get the fish what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want them to output You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like it's hard to get quality
quality Yeah, I mean it was it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: never the most efficient thing for almost
anyone no matter who you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah as a result It wasn't it what you
know, it's not like you had a thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: fish business that you sold tilapia and
yeah sold cannabis Like it just didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's a cool like closed-loop
method in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Am I right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be fastidious and very Detail
oriented or you know, I mean I'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: something too like about craft like even
say 20 years ago or 25 years ago like in
[SPEAKER_00]: the when a lot of people were growing like
generator scenes in the woods around Here
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Most of the people that worked there
that were growing at a hundred or two
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred lighters Almost all of them bought
their head stash from people that had four
[SPEAKER_00]: to ten lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah because it was just nicer Yeah,
I mean even ten thousand square feet is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a lot of weed Yeah, you know,
so like where is where is craft?
[SPEAKER_00]: where is the amount where and not just
like growing it but like growing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: Handling it and drying it and curing it
all the right way because you can fuck up
[SPEAKER_00]: at any of those steps Yep, and then it's
not as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just about like growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all the way to the end Can you
manage that whole thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah at scale, you know So I don't know
and matches It's interesting on that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard where it where is craft,
you know, there's crap What's a craft size
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a craft size greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a craft size outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a curious thing to pose to the
community Is someone just typed in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know kin blah blah blah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that kendo?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know blah blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that's kendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talking about I know there's a bunch
of kens, but Kendo, you know kendo,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I know kendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kendo is funny He's like the older
me just talks mad shit to air except he's
[SPEAKER_02]: tough a Tough version of me Yeah,
you know, yeah, that's what's cool that
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway just to close on that That's what's
cool about craft is that everybody agrees
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is fire and craft and really
really excellent weed Just no one agrees
[SPEAKER_00]: what that exactly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it allows everyone to fight over
it and claim it Sure, and now there's huge
[SPEAKER_00]: ass scenes growing straight mids claiming
craft because it's just a marketing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it means it's losing its its value and
name like calling something craft is gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: lose its value like calling something gate
You know or it happens in any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people want to attach their not
quality Onto quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah is really what it comes down to Yeah,
so we're gonna have we're gonna have some
[SPEAKER_00]: guests coming up, but it didn't pop for
this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna do a a part two of
cloneless Where Matt, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we go we're gonna go back and maybe I'll
give a little bit background real quick
[SPEAKER_00]: again here So we're mostly talking about
90s to say like 2005 to 2010 clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, right and the reason for that Is that
sort of before then like there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: immense amount of diversity because weed
was rare enough in most places That
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that grew quote-unquote kind bud
it all sold Yeah, and it was easy to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: which allowed people to pop seeds get
stuff from seed banks Trade with their
[SPEAKER_00]: local friends and keep this random ass
shit that worked well for them Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: right and what happened is you know with
the purple wave and then the sour wave and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cush wave and Then the skittles and
cookies and all that is that every huge
[SPEAKER_00]: wave came along and instead of a whole
bunch of different people growing All
[SPEAKER_00]: these things lots of people started
growing similar families of stuff Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what sold well and a lot of
those other things sort of went by the
[SPEAKER_00]: wayside So there's this enormous amount of
cuttings from like I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt nice childhood But like, you know a
younger time a younger time in cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that like a lot of which have
fallen by the wayside And some which are
[SPEAKER_00]: still around but a lot of which were super
famous at the time because it hadn't had
[SPEAKER_00]: to be so monocrop Yep, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I did when monocrop didn't
happen before monocrop became a thing This
[SPEAKER_00]: is what we all grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that this is part two of that
What we grew before monocropping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty much is pretty much it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that they can't about the clone list
only covered so many, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's It was pretty comprehensive,
but it wasn't all-encompassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot that was not on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I added a bunch I also I don't know if
I know not so you hadn't seen these before
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have them or whatever These are the
old strain books from Green Candy Press my
[SPEAKER_02]: dad my buddy Jack Released these a while
ago and it has it's pretty much that era
[SPEAKER_02]: of 2006 to 2012 breeders seed makers of
All sorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's bullshit in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's excellent shit in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's everything in between good info
bad info But there it's a good resource
[SPEAKER_02]: for knowing what was being at least being
talked about growing around these times
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did the cannabis Indica volume
one through three and then they did the
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis sativa volume One through
three and these are on Amazon still so
[SPEAKER_02]: grab them while they're still around It's
a great questions are coming hard and
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll throw something out there real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll interject People are talking a ton
about the white family and white widow
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we've mentioned this but you
know when the white family hit in the mid
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s It was like a tidal wave in cannabis
It became the biggest one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: most popular cuts and lines in weed for
about five to eight years perhaps Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so as a result it got crossed with
almost everything else good right and It
[SPEAKER_00]: is there everything white is in this era
that we're talking about all the great
[SPEAKER_00]: white shark and white widow and white I
know and blue widow and all the numerous
[SPEAKER_00]: things because that was one of the first
strains that like lots of people Got and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're like, I'm gonna cross it to
everything cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yeah so white Russian You know,
there's a bunch of the white family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an og cush of its day Yeah,
where people got it and it was like the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing You know, yes, so That's it's
definitely and it still percolates around
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there it's probably In more
things than people realize yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the names just got changed,
you know so But we're gonna kind of do
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing with uh with Matt where he's
got a big Fucking list and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid fire off some stuff and do some
off-the-head what we think about it what
[SPEAKER_00]: we remember experiences and so forth He's
got the list so I don't know what's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: but we'll see yeah one second I was gonna
invite archive on but he's hitting the
[SPEAKER_02]: airplane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um yeah, so some of these on this list
some of them like I may have no knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: about it and Not so am I not either but
because it was something going around at
[SPEAKER_02]: the time So at least we can kind of
acknowledge it I mean, there's there's so
[SPEAKER_02]: many that didn't end up on this list that
that I mean there might be a Part three
[SPEAKER_00]: part four part 30 row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just the framework to riff off
of for the most part About history and
[SPEAKER_00]: strains of old and their impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also didn't choose specific seed
lines Unless they had a clone in it that
[SPEAKER_02]: was well-known So there's a lot of seed
lines in here like white rhino where like
[SPEAKER_02]: in the US I don't remember a specific
white rhino clone going around there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't there wasn't an elite that like at
least that made it onto the National like
[SPEAKER_00]: forum and like traded scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Okay, so last week we left off with
Matanuska Valley Thunderfuck yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we did indeed and right after that
comes og Kush Oh Kush, so one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things I was thinking when covering og
Kush We could just do a quick rundown of
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the og clones that were some of
the more early clones that were named Okay
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire mop so as far as I know I'll start
with four and Matt can riff off that if he
[SPEAKER_00]: wants there's obviously whatever you want
to call the og Kush that Matt Bubba and
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh brought West to LA There's that that
started the whole LA thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, there's the TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, right There's an old one called the
master.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a Bubba og that I'm not sure
where it came from and there's Supposedly
[SPEAKER_00]: the you know the flow rider Okay,
and then from there from a bunch of bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and everything else that exploded
into You know and there's debate on that
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, if I'd left off some
important thing or whatever Don't get all
[SPEAKER_00]: pissy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a hugely convoluted family with
a lot of weird origins Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have early on let me see SFV
Larry We have Tahoe we have the soul
[SPEAKER_02]: assassin one through three we have so I
have to close my eyes to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry This almost has to win through
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have we have the face-offs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember how many there were the
face-offs archive can say Then of course
[SPEAKER_02]: the 92 which who knows when that's from
there's a whole like pure Kush family
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's one as far as I know there's
one pure Kush and then everything else
[SPEAKER_02]: people called pure Kush, which was a og
cut What were some of the other ones
[SPEAKER_02]: Louie, of course?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're like private resources
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, so there's an aspect where
you could literally walk into a club in LA
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2009 or something or eight and it would
be like 25 listed OGs from different
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, like it took over Southern,
California and and as a result of that
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are probably renamed some of
those are probably bag seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was like I mean that was literally
went from like We don't even know how many
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts and if there were sisters to each
other It does seem a few different cushy
[SPEAKER_00]: things came out of Florida via different
people Yeah, and hit California and spread
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then it exploded into its own
family, but it's like a whole episode in
[SPEAKER_00]: itself so if we want to keep to like the
the timeline or whatever of Reading off
[SPEAKER_00]: more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could probably talk about og for an
hour Yeah, those are the ones like and and
[SPEAKER_02]: there were other ones But that people are
naming but those were most of the early
[SPEAKER_02]: ones, you know, I hear people constantly
saying Oh got that diamond og,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that old shit and I'm like,
no There was like a very small list of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ogs that were going around and then
everything after that was Shot off after
[SPEAKER_02]: that like, you know the planetary ogs that
people mentioned were later renamed some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff But it was during this time the
planetary ogs were going around P 91 P 91
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Matt talk about this one much
more than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his it's his wheelhouse It's an old
San Diego strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different stories behind
it a lot of different claims to who has
[SPEAKER_02]: made it Everything from saying it was like
the g-13 story strapped to a Berkeley
[SPEAKER_02]: story Yeah, there's all kinds of crazy
crazy different things that could be I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's some kind of like I could see
silver pearls super skunks some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani somethings But yeah, it's a what
most people consider a classic old Indica
[SPEAKER_02]: predating the og craze and so Cal was one
of the big ones like bull rider and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the others yeah, it's it's it's got his
name P 91 either from Poe classic 91 or
[SPEAKER_02]: peanut 91 We don't know there's just
endless arguments, but it does have a
[SPEAKER_02]: weird nutty turf profile Nutty kind of
accurate It's weird man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good cut though Yeah, so next Next
we got pez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know pez very well has You know
CSI has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a northern lights type plant It's one
of it's one of those ones where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated because you wish that is it
five by two Is it nl skunk one is it this
[SPEAKER_00]: that whatever but it got renamed by?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a classic 90s and now yeah,
you know in that like it's bright green
[SPEAKER_00]: and has those nice hairs that like you
know Yeah, it just looks like a classic
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of 90s hydro to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right Here's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your wheelhouse perps perps maybe
talk about your perps and other perps You
[SPEAKER_00]: know Yeah, perps is just I mean perps has
been with us forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in a way There's a lot of plants
up in my neck of the woods that turn
[SPEAKER_00]: purple with fall But then sort of the ones
that like everybody is kind of familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with You know is the Mendo P and then all
the stuff that got famous in the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Yeah, the Urkel the great babe We
chatted about that a bunch and I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the story of the Mendo P But I
believe it's it's from the late 70s Grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendocino County and put in this dude's
closet for a couple decades Until I got it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the late 90s Yeah, and I have no idea
what it is except for he remembered where
[SPEAKER_00]: he grew it because he said it was the only
purple Weedy ever grew and it was grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kovalo in the late 70s And I tend to
believe them just because it tests like
[SPEAKER_00]: very within the range of most 70s cannabis
Yeah, and you you breed with it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got just an enormously wide gene pool So I
remember I had something I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought about it earlier today with the
perps so when you talk when you told the
[SPEAKER_02]: story you were talking about how he gave
you some seeds in a bag of weed and The
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds he gave you were from the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you brought it back, he said,
oh, that's that purple one Do you think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was from the same era as the so the thing
is is that he thought he was giving me
[SPEAKER_00]: different seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I can't even remember what it
was supposed to be And there was and like
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I only there was only two of them
that popped one male and one girl the boy
[SPEAKER_00]: died and When I got this weed it was so
royal purple and sweet It smelled so
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't know what it was So I
brought it to him and I said this doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: look like you know what it was supposed to
be and the only reason why I know the year
[SPEAKER_00]: is because he said That's the only purple
weed I ever grew and I grew it here Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that's really that's really all I
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't know Jack He just said it was
you know, they were playing around with
[SPEAKER_00]: with like Afghans and stuff that wasn't
sativa that was faster We're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: mix that in, you know or whatever Yeah,
and so they were trying stuff and he said
[SPEAKER_00]: he grew it one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know shit Yeah, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he the you're applying to the the purse
not the other so I got it in so I got it
[SPEAKER_00]: in Yeah, I got he didn't he didn't tell me
a year until and he said the only reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why he even remembered that year is
because it was the only time he grew weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that was purple like that got it,
you know, so So he remembered the year
[SPEAKER_00]: later when I actually showed him flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And you know CSI's bread with it a
bunch I have other people have it's
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously it's it's super super terpy low
THC and Super wide band as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know And when I got it in 1998,
so at the time those seeds were 21 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old 22 years old Yeah, 21 years old
something like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was now that was 24 years ago
You've got people obsessing over your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's killing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah All right, so um Purple I was gonna
do purple indica, but since Fletch is
[SPEAKER_02]: getting on a plane I don't want to cover
probably Nick and I've never grown pure
[SPEAKER_02]: purple indica So I can't really comment on
it, but you can see our last interview
[SPEAKER_02]: with archive and we covered purple indica
pretty well there so it's a good Call back
[SPEAKER_02]: to that episode which is available on
YouTube and Spotify and all that purple
[SPEAKER_02]: purple The irk what was your first
experience with her?
[SPEAKER_02]: When's the first time you saw it and
smoked it and near your feelings on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 2003 2000 2003 okay for sure
easily 2003 it started getting passed
[SPEAKER_00]: around Mendo as You know the thing to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was super slow growing but there
was a huge demand for it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I still think there's a fairly
mysterious Origin of it or whatever And
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, so it's one of the few strains that
has gotten that famous That we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: like a crew that came out with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we only got like some certain claims
that are Not nobody's sure nobody's really
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some claims to it, but nobody's
really sure And you know the lavender and
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think later got attributed to
soma, but I'm not sure if it is the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that got famous Yeah, yeah But the
lavender and the earth came at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and my buddy that gave me
the tango He got the lavender from
[SPEAKER_00]: McKinleyville humble In humble and I had
gotten the Urkel from a source in Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: and we showed each other flower and they
were pretty similar Yeah, they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same but like we got the cuts
those two cuts within six months of each
[SPEAKER_02]: other I remember my first experience with
Urkel was something similar and I saw a
[SPEAKER_02]: cut of lavender around the same Time and
they were obviously related the the Urkel
[SPEAKER_02]: cut the lavender cut to me were obviously
related So from that point on I always
[SPEAKER_02]: assumed that Urkel must have come from the
lavender seed line You know because I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: the clone that must be real lavender But I
don't know if if that was just like an
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel bag seed rename Just being sold as
lavender because lavender was pop popular
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my so my opinion is that the
original Urkel and the original lavender
[SPEAKER_00]: were were somewhat closely related And
they popped up on the scene and up here
[SPEAKER_00]: and they basically at the exact same time
But then soma has a line that he sold for
[SPEAKER_00]: years named lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes And so anybody that pops seeds of that
would obviously call it lavender And so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's different lavenders that float
around There's also someone from Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: that claims they made that lavender I
can't remember his name off the top of my
[SPEAKER_02]: head but claims he made it and that soma
hijacked it from him and the guy was known
[SPEAKER_02]: for making Other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't like a just a random bold
claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was something that might have
merit It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then it's so it's like one of
those things where I just think that like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Urkel is a little easier because there
was one Urk and You know and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender it's like there was the cut that
I remember and then there was Somas
[SPEAKER_00]: selling thousands of seeds of something
called lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so a lot of people think that
the lavender is somas Yeah, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people apparently think it's mad farters
too, but that's uh, we that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: Tantamount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been disproven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been smashed the but I I the first
lavender I saw was before soma had was
[SPEAKER_00]: selling seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't I don't think you know,
yeah All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so someone mentioned this in here and
I think it's it's a great one to bring up
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have experience with permafrost?
[SPEAKER_00]: permafrost Yeah, I actually don't but I do
think that that and like coral reef Or
[SPEAKER_00]: something or two things that homie archive
has been hunting for yeah, and I do
[SPEAKER_00]: remember permafrost from Smoking it from
some of those uh, brawn parties in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s, but I never grew it myself So
I don't have a bunch of comments on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only got it and passed it To an idiot,
but it's a white widow train wreck if I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember correctly That's what people said
it was that's about all I had to comment
[SPEAKER_02]: on it I never got to grow it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super frosty Snow yeah a little bit
in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you cross white widow I mean train
wrecking white widow are both pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: crystal II things Yeah in that era or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had that aft, you know, I don't know
it it was pretty All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see Purple effects purple
effects purple effects was Made by me if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can consider accidents made by me by
someone So I had I had this strain called
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, which was a garlic bud that Tim
Blake one of Tim Blake's main workers gave
[SPEAKER_00]: to me in the late 90s and you know,
and so I I had this room going of a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different stuff and it was summer and
an air conditioner died and it got hot for
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple days until we repaired it and The
Mendo P as it can sometimes do it hermed
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the purple effect all over the
effects, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up with these two effects
plants that had hundreds of Mendo P seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right And out of that those seeds
came what we called the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's in the Canna Bible A couple of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I don't know we grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we grew it a bunch it had It was
it's really killer weed the the turpogs
[SPEAKER_00]: used it and rose and then sprite and some
stuff like that It's been floating around
[SPEAKER_00]: Leightonville It's the first it's the
first breeding that ever happened with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo P. Yeah, it was it was feminized
Years before I even knew what that meant
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in the era that we were even suspect
that using the seeds might be fucking shit
[SPEAKER_00]: up Yeah, because they were all herm seed
But I did it anyway because I loved the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants so much and all I had was two
females So yeah, you know and it came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's that's the purple effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right It's one of those like
I don't know if it's necessarily a myth
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is true that if something herms
It has that trait it may pass it on to the
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny But it also might not it also
might not be triggered by something that
[SPEAKER_02]: normally would trick trigger stuff So it
you know, that was one of those things for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that I always heard is Oh,
you better not pop those make with the
[SPEAKER_00]: harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get harms Yeah, somebody
asked how did the accident happen the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo P?
[SPEAKER_00]: herms, right and if she undergoes
environmental stress It often makes her
[SPEAKER_00]: throw bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so like I said, it was summertime
the AC broke It got hot for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days until we could get the AC repaired
And she threw some bananas and just
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to pollinate the plants that were
right next to her on the tray Whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're mad you often throw bananas too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really weird, you know, so yeah,
so that was that was the purple effects It
[SPEAKER_00]: floated around it's any number of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really it's really terpy And it's
pretty potent All right Sensei star,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean this is one of those where there's
pretty much one main clone going around
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of people had or at least one
expression that Commonly popped up enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to be passed around as multiple clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe did you ever grow any sensei star?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it for a little bit and to be
perfectly honest, I got rid of it And I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't I just thought of it as kind of a
boring Afghan One of our friends is so mad
[SPEAKER_00]: at you right now I know I know that
doesn't mean that I grew the one you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's true later on later on one
version at least became pretty famous and
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke is one of the people from paradise
seeds He's refused to give any lineage or
[SPEAKER_00]: any information about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't offered for all that that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Yeah, it was not as regular
seeds, but his feminine I seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he's ever stopped offering
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think He's ever stopped offering
it as family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I just meant I don't you know The
regular seeds was what like it was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five year period or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think it was a four or five
year period I think he gave someone
[SPEAKER_02]: testers that was a friend that person
reproduced them which caused him to say
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck that I'm only doing them from now on
as I understand it Wow, so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it it gets claimed to be so it's it
seems to be a pretty good breeder There's
[SPEAKER_00]: a cut that floats around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean there's a good there's
another cut that floats Around that was
[SPEAKER_00]: called Since he star but is actually like
a nirvana four-way something something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow I could see that kind of
translating a little bit and confusing
[SPEAKER_00]: people though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and so yeah, there's
there's like a history to it, but
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately it it wasn't offered for
very long and You know, there's a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that float around You know and that's
the other thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like not everybody thinks everything
is elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so sometimes You might get something
and grow it and it's not for you or you
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't the right environment for it And
you have better things and you just move
[SPEAKER_00]: on and other people it's the bees knees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I think we just recently did snow but
you can cover it again real quick just to
[SPEAKER_00]: plug it in here We did snow got famous in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep It was called it was often called
Oregon snow or Eugene snow even It made
[SPEAKER_00]: its way down to humble and got called
Humboldt snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It was cropped by a bunch of people
or CSI used to run it from the he's had a
[SPEAKER_00]: cut of it since the late 90s And it was
brought out from Florida By a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: people I know and it was called skunk five
in Florida Yeah, and it's a low turps
[SPEAKER_00]: super frosty Afghan that occasionally can
be absolutely delicious and at other times
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a little bland Yeah, but it's super
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great breeder it seems anything you
cross it to makes nice plants and It's a
[SPEAKER_00]: it's heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's pretty purple, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pretty purple up pretty good purple
up at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay We've done whole episodes on
sour, but might as well Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the the the cool part I guess about
sour is that more people in the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: family are starting to speak up recently
Yeah, that were involved, you know Vondo
[SPEAKER_00]: swell Manny, you know people that really
hadn't spoken up very much And so they've
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmed some things You know sour sour
came according to them came from diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: too, which they called headband So the
first headband was a very sour type Skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: type plant that they found some seeds in
yeah, and they called it our diesel and
[SPEAKER_00]: that led to sour diesel It's been it's
been covered but and that is and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you know the headband story
and the Confusion around that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: tales spawned around it with people
claiming they had the real New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: headband They had the real this you take a
famous story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's light on detail and you're gonna
get people to fill in detail Sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: right sure will and so with Manny and some
of those other guys coming out and telling
[SPEAKER_00]: their side of the story We actually have
some stuff that used to be just the
[SPEAKER_00]: version of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah be kind of become the story Yeah,
so that's cool And and someone's asking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the original New York City diesel
that's exactly what we just talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's a there's a further
complication and that in that diesel was
[SPEAKER_00]: slang for fireweed in New York City back
then Yes, which is why they called the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: our diesel when they gave it to homie
Because they wanted to differentiate it
[SPEAKER_00]: from all the other diesel coming around
and there's another cut named original
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel Which may or may not be the cut
Matt has but there's a different guy that
[SPEAKER_00]: has It that's just the first diesel that
he got in Vermont and he stuck that label
[SPEAKER_02]: on it, you know, so Anyway, yeah,
yeah and diesel was called diesel because
[SPEAKER_02]: it was G's diesel Yeah, one of the people
in the chem crew Yeah diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes the car diesel another great name that
not so calls it the car So there's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's it's it's one of those
things where it could be an entire episode
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to condense it but and we've
talked about it before So yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a full episode about it Shoreline,
did you ever get to try any of the recent
[SPEAKER_02]: shoreline for marker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know I'm not in the secret
secret cool club, but apparently not so I
[SPEAKER_02]: will let I will let Matt describe the
shoreline so I got to try outdoor versions
[SPEAKER_02]: and indoor versions and The indoor was
like hot garbage very well done I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think it would it reminds me a lot of
lemon G in the way the bud is formed in
[SPEAKER_02]: that It's not as pretty as modern weed
that people would love but it is very it's
[SPEAKER_02]: resinous and it's it's not Airy airy,
but it's not super dense like Like cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: or any of those kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did smell like hot garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say roadkill skunk I would say
hot garbage, but that's my nose someone
[SPEAKER_02]: else might totally Smell something
skunkiest fucking it and I could see how
[SPEAKER_02]: it could lean that way because of the hot
garbage Not there's a little sweetness to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of turpentine
Somewhere in the background, I think Now
[SPEAKER_02]: the outdoor version had the hot garbage
But it also was loud as fuck with piss
[SPEAKER_02]: with and when I say cat piss or I mean
like human piss Like not like turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the closest thing to cat piss
smelling that actually smelled like urine
[SPEAKER_00]: so what's funny about weed is that there
are aromas and weed that are Strangely
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be horrific in any other
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Yeah, yeah, I mean some people liken
the chem D to a dead body Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know things of that new things that
would be universally gross Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know end up in weed because that
description is sounds horrible to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest Yeah, I mean, it's not horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bunch of friends that love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good weed I'm not dissing it,
but I just mean that like when Matt was
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it doesn't sound I don't
know if you're ordering out on the menu as
[SPEAKER_00]: the Specials, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah smells like hot garbage and human pee
Yeah, dead bodies actually smell like
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet shit if you didn't know that sweet
sweet Rotten meat feces like when meat
[SPEAKER_02]: rots in a trash can for too long and sweet
We have some good friends that run it
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple good friends that run it and so
it's in our it's in our pretty close
[SPEAKER_00]: Circle of friends and it's a really good
cut It has a pretty complicated lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the high too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a very good high I wouldn't say
it's wickedly potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hold its own Yeah, I mean,
you know me at the good highs are our base
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the most important thing So
what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry cough strawberry cough I like
the cough quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think grown well Grown especially
organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really nice tasting up energetic
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I don't know how much I believe about
the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think the story is pretty
suspect I think the person that tells it
[SPEAKER_00]: is pretty suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Kyle, but You know, but it but it's a
great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I don't believe much about the story,
but I like the weed quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked a lot with The herb beer line,
which is a Swiss strawberry sativa and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked a lot with strawberry cough
Expressions in the strawberry cream that
[SPEAKER_02]: was from a strawberry cough s1.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was positive Absolutely positive that
that expression is just an herb beer
[SPEAKER_02]: expression, which is a super strawberry
Resonance not necessarily make a potent,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not terrible very dense The old
herb beer and strawberry cough are damn
[SPEAKER_02]: near identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it could be a hybrid of it of some
sort I don't even know if the years match
[SPEAKER_02]: up but goddamn if they're not identical in
every way So who knows who knows I would
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with that assessment I think at its
best it tastes really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a good uplifting high It's not
overpowering and doesn't have any paranoia
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not knock you down strong,
but it's not weak either Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns nicely When done, well,
you know, it's a pretty nice little plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah trainwreck trainwreck trainwreck to
me is Is famous for a couple reasons one
[SPEAKER_00]: it was one of the first named clones that
got passed around in Humboldt and Mendo as
[SPEAKER_00]: a named clone Yeah, like I think Caleb
would even say it's probably one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first things that he got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, like that was that had a name to it
that wasn't just like seed lines or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, right and it yielded big and it
was frosty and it looked good and it so it
[SPEAKER_00]: got grown a ton and It you know,
it was strong turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a lot of people's first
experience with a turpentine bomb type
[SPEAKER_00]: strain Yeah, and it had its moment in the
Sun and now there's a bunch of debate
[SPEAKER_00]: about the real one or the fake ones We
have a good friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several good friends of ours
actually That do work with with train
[SPEAKER_00]: wrecks And they're a cool plant,
you know, it flowers actually pretty fast
[SPEAKER_00]: outside Yeah for all of its sativa
characteristics and all that It actually
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think it triggers quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like is what happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the high from it the resin
production It does breed dominant for
[SPEAKER_02]: those the the heavy turpentine turps,
but I love the high from it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all anti anxiety something People it
fucking spins them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't recommend it for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, our buddy Pack from Santa Cruz
goat farm has a bunch of train wreck
[SPEAKER_02]: reversals fem lines right now on Right
seeds comm so go check them out Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was it was it was nice buds that
got thrown on a big sativa frame Yep,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people will get two pounds of
light growing it So it became popular You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I I see it coming back and and it's
gonna come back strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in hybrids I think I think on its
own.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very novel for the first,
you know, if it's new to you It's novel
[SPEAKER_02]: and cool and different If you've grown a
lot of Jack and a lot of Durban a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: depending stuff It may not be as cool,
but in the hybrids it fucking it shines it
[SPEAKER_00]: shines Yeah, and what's funny about it is
in that era people called turpentine train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck turks Yeah, and then that got
dethroned by Jack turks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure did Because Jack came along and
took the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah away And and train wreck never didn't
get talked about in that regard in that
[SPEAKER_00]: era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so strong turpentine You would talk
about train wreck turk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah train wrecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like train wreck Smells like the
wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one that you have a lot more
experience with especially the original
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the Trinity the trend Yeah,
so it it is my introduction to the trend
[SPEAKER_00]: was basically There's some people that
know that are more tied into it than I am
[SPEAKER_00]: I was but it is one of these things where
supposedly it came out of a bag seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from Trinity County That was traded
to a glassblower That was traded to a
[SPEAKER_00]: glassblower for some some pipes and they
sprouted that seed in the Eugene glass
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing area scene Right, and it sort of
started spreading around that little
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and it was kind of a
dinosaur leaf plant Some people got skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: off it some people got burnt Rubber some
people got like a sweet pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to vary and it got really
popular in Oregon and then Everyone lost
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it disappeared for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But it's a cool plant and and people
were asking about the goat monkey one that
[SPEAKER_02]: same one that we have all gotten and grown
in our circle too and I I don't I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have experience with the original Trinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know I couldn't say if it's
real or not, but I know CSI and And and
[SPEAKER_02]: not so or Attempting to figure that out in
some way shape or form by reaching out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the original dudes Yeah, I mean part of
the part of the issue is too is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bunch of friends that had it But
then what is your 15 or 18 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: memory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's so that really does play into
it when you haven't seen something in a
[SPEAKER_00]: super long time But you had it in 98 or
99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you absolutely guarantee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and most people that think
it's not it think it's like It's it's at
[SPEAKER_00]: the very least the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Half my friends think it's it the
other half are and most of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't sure it's it It's because they
people can grow it's so nice now It
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't look like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in a way it gets a little bigger than
what they remember Yeah, and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: thing we grow so much different than we
used to and people don't realize how
[SPEAKER_02]: vastly different people grow than they
used to but you know What's funny about
[SPEAKER_00]: that is so I got it back and then that was
the year that I got evacuated from my spot
[SPEAKER_00]: during A fire yeah, and then it froze and
so I had some small trends out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: they went through hell and almost died But
they came back and finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and every person I showed that jar
It was like leafy and sparse buds and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that everyone thought I had the nose to
the tee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and Everyone was convinced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it and Then the next year I grew it
in perfect conditions in a greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: fully organic and fed it really nice And
it came out with fat buds and people were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh it looks too nice Yeah,
it can't be the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it to get nice buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's impossible It's it's a leafy
shitty see-through type of strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, you know The one that's the one
that's floating around right now Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's strong weed and people are often
surprised when they smoke it how high they
[SPEAKER_00]: get Oh interesting regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it knocked pimp on his ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did it surprised them how strong He got
we didn't finish the joint when he was
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting one time So regardless of whether
or not it's actually the real one this the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that floats around is an excellent
strain Let's show I'll clown on myself to
[SPEAKER_02]: show how different people grew at least me
in 2006 then now this is a picture of
[SPEAKER_02]: clockwork of me training like it's vastly
different There's no resin production on
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean a lot of people are growing like
that going through these old books like
[SPEAKER_02]: that is just what we looked like that that
nobody Yeah, there wasn't really a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-assessment going on that talk about
that where you know They grew in five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots with plain water and all in
soil amendments with metal halides in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon in a rudimentary 97, you know your
1997 setup Yeah, you know and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're obviously 25 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're still growing weed, you're
probably better at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah That I was growing in hundred degree
rooms like no like no issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so I believe Oh Williams wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you go to the MLB or any of the
Williams wonder cuts going around?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown Williams wonder The one I
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not particularly potent but it is a
large yielding and to me like sweet and
[SPEAKER_00]: very old-school Stella smelling Afghan
that stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's kind of a it's not Brown it's a
little tannish maybe in kind of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that it grows Yeah, like the the bud
formation or whatever And there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the Pacific Northwest or at
least was five or six years ago that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it Selling it to old people
getting three pounds of light So it floats
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then you know various breeders
have used it because anything that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: tendency to throw donkey dick style buds
They want to mix that into their seed
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh sure Especially back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you know But it's one of I think
it's one of those old seed lines that like
[SPEAKER_00]: People get excited about and it would
probably occasionally throw a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but it probably has a decent
propensity of junk Yeah If you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth, you know a lot of those 80s and 90s
varieties had some crazy elites in them
[SPEAKER_00]: But they might have like a 20% of it might
be trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I feel like Going back and
looking at a lot of the different 80s and
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s Indicas that were being pushed out
from Amsterdam the their Afghan ease the
[SPEAKER_02]: different Afghani blends and stuff the
hash plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of fucking Just so far
stuff so far looking anyways, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies kind of changed the game as far as
requiring what weed needs to look like
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people were certainly willing to
accept much uglier cannabis As long as it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah smoked good You know Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're gonna enter the list of things
that we've added in or what have you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to start with your list or
mine?
[SPEAKER_02]: You go for yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay First is gonna be crystal chunk since
it's fresh on your memory crystal chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one could also be for a while So the
crystal chunk I actually found out a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more about just this past
couple weeks So how crystal chunk is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to me is that it was the first
clone that my friend gave me To grow
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in my one lighter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all remember our first and so it yeah I
grew the crystal chunk and then there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of people in Chicago that grew
the crystal chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made its way out to Colorado it made
its way to Montana and there was various
[SPEAKER_00]: circles of people that grew it it was a It
was an NL of some kind It was popped in 88
[SPEAKER_00]: or 89 in Carbondale, Illinois and it was a
number of things these guys used to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: to Neville every year and buy seats and
Then they would come back to Carbondale,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in far southern, Illinois It's a
college town down there and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: blow up indoors and then in order to not
get busted in their college town They
[SPEAKER_00]: would sell the weed in the huge city of
Chicago like four hours north That makes
[SPEAKER_00]: right and that cat and that kept them
anonymous in their hometown Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chunk is some kind of NL from Neville
in 88 or 89 I don't know if it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think not Yeah, I have some friends that
have hybrids in it I brought it to
[SPEAKER_00]: California in 98 and I moved out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe so But it's a cool one super
potent Low odor low low smell low taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know if that clone still around?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't My buddies that I just my buddies
that I just went and visited said that it
[SPEAKER_00]: existed as late as 2013 Oh, wow,
so kicking around till then and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: see and they gave me some seeds of it I'm
not pure, you know, not yeah, but but but
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed with other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see other cool shit Yeah,
I'm excited to hear about that sometime
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep chunk somebody just said finally
hearing about crystal chunk first kind but
[SPEAKER_00]: I experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh interesting That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean those guys down in Carbondale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew but they had more than that But
that the chunk kind of got spread around a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and became pretty famous in
those little circles Yeah, you know Did
[SPEAKER_00]: you say deep chunk deep chunk deep chunk
is pretty famous in various ways I would
[SPEAKER_00]: say It floated around Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just talking about this yesterday
It floated around Mendocino because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of where one of the places It was
developed as monkey balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes We all called it monkey balls back
then because it was like golf ball size
[SPEAKER_00]: purplish super You know chunky Some were
frosty and it was grown a lot on spyrock
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people I knew that grew
grew it grew it out that way then it
[SPEAKER_00]: became famous in another way because Tom
Hill made it and He ended up becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty famous on the forum Yes Right,
and so he had he had a with Vic high and
[SPEAKER_00]: other he became very he was sort of one of
the big personalities For a long time on
[SPEAKER_00]: on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super intelligent super
knowledgeable super cantankerous Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know didn't have a lot of patience for
idiocy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we suffered no fool No, he didn't have
a lot of patience for idiocy and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: might actually be It might actually be one
of the only IBLs out there Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's I noticed someone was saying that
they just they've seen people taking it to
[SPEAKER_02]: f13 on Selling and selling seeds of it
like deep chunk was already as close to
[SPEAKER_02]: IBL as you're gonna get if people keep
taking that in words Generations,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what they're trying to
achieve other than making more seed maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: but eventually you're gonna separate from
some Heavy heavy in red depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what you do with it at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was already It was already where it
needed to be Yeah, there's people saying
[SPEAKER_00]: purple purple monkey balls monkey balls
was pretty common in Mendel like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: got cold October nights Yeah, most of the
plant would purple up, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in that regard and so it was like
that's how I got introduced to it It's
[SPEAKER_00]: just one of those old-time hill strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And the problem with purple chunk in
my air, you know deep chunk In my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it is what it is and it breeds
very much like itself Yeah, and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, so if you like that and that's
what you want to add in and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: add in some of those qualities You can't
Yeah, I've seen very good Seed lines of
[SPEAKER_02]: deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know CSI inspector has some and KOS The
rev has an amazing one, but I've seen very
[SPEAKER_02]: very bad resinless just Terrible deep
chunks which a resinless deep chunk is a
[SPEAKER_02]: disappointing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So it can you know on the right the
right hybrid the right outcross?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it can lend qualities to it that
make it overall amazing And it can also
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of be a very boring leafy not
fun high athlete Yeah someone asked it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: good question and and and it'll be Good to
answer since a lot of people probably
[SPEAKER_02]: don't understand this if plants get
inbreeding depression How do you get land
[SPEAKER_02]: races?
[SPEAKER_02]: So land races are constant Big populations
wild populations and there is some
[SPEAKER_02]: inbreeding that goes on but because it's a
wild diverse population It's always going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a little bit diverse as it goes You
know some do get inbreeding depression
[SPEAKER_02]: some and lots of land races are just pure
Like CBD heavy low THC, you know herm
[SPEAKER_02]: Machines and that's just what cannabis
wants to be another another way to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe the scale of it is that When we
talk about inbreeding depression,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly we're talking about small indoor
greenhouse style selections with maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like You know anywhere from one to a
few males perhaps and you know certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of females where what Matt was
describing If you're in Mexico or Thailand
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever is fields of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes with thousands of brothers and sisters
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's where the seeded comes
from and so as a result of that You're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get like a much wider population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when we start messing with them in
much smaller non field size environments
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that you can get inbred pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Somebody was asking me if we can
speak on Tom Hills Hayes Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean there's not a clone that goes
around it at so But yeah, it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: famous strain of his If it was pretty
notorious for the fact that like Doug
[SPEAKER_02]: would tell people, you know You need to
get ten packs to find a keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just is what it is on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from positronics There Hayes 19 is
is some from Sam's Hayes if I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So yeah, he positronics is one of the
three people besides Sam that Sam gave
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes to when he went to Amsterdam,
yeah, he gave it to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave it to corral from Super City the
seed club and he gave it to posse Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he actually worked at posse for a bit
as far as like just helping making
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding selections and things of that
nature so Tom Hills Hayes is from The
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes that Sam gave to posse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's a lot of hey hey would be a
great name for it is very Hay and charity
[SPEAKER_02]: and lots of hay lots of carrot hay,
but I did see some really beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: Examples of it from hazy lady over on mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and I'm not sure she deleted her
account after he played after but There
[SPEAKER_02]: might those pictures might still be up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to see a beautiful haze
look for hazy ladies hazy why la dy or
[SPEAKER_00]: Grove Tom Hills Hayes and there's an
aspect to where like even when even when
[SPEAKER_00]: like the flying dog Dutchman or whatever
was selling Sam's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes his oh Hayes or whatever, you know
They even said that like only 10% of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna be You kind of have to hunt a
lot and there's a lot of junk in that haze
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the problem with Hayes is that
since most of it goes 16 to 24 weeks You
[SPEAKER_00]: know searching for the needle in a
haystack and having the space to run a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred of them Yeah, and then smoke test
them and figure out which one or two are
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that are Good and the rest are
mostly bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's time-consuming and jungle weed
and a lot of space Okay, silver pearl did
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to try Oh, yeah, what do you
think?
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminded me of the silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew in the 90s In the sense that this
is gonna sound gross again But it has this
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's this thing when babies are
firstborn and all they drink Is milk and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting a lot of their moms like
colostrum or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and baby poo kind of has this like
sweet Like it's it's just it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: all that gross Yeah, right and then they
start eating real different foods and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like then it's just shit, you know But
yeah, but the silver pearl has this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like sweet young young baby poo type
smells And I smelled that in his cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got pick out like bubblegummy,
but not pink bubble gum like some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet and then Not skunky but somewhere
along that direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite smells I mean the
other thing is that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had kids and you didn't so There's a
point when you have aromas that what
[SPEAKER_00]: reminds you of what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, like we talked about how there's no
skunks in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be actually exposed To the
smell to have smelling something else
[SPEAKER_00]: Trigger that memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not got my nose a baby shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, you know The silver pearl was to
get a little bit more specific I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: silver pearl is a mix of early girls skunk
one and nl5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes And it is a pretty leafy frosty nice
smelling, you know, you know, it was an
[SPEAKER_02]: early Polyhybrid from never it was it's a
great resin dumper for like dry sifted
[SPEAKER_02]: shit, too It is so frosty, but it is so
leafy It's leafy and very frosty and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know back then especially like most things
were most things that were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: released were F ones Yeah, and so that was
that was sort of in the first wave of poly
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids of different crosses He'd made and
then combining those into into different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool old line From both the seed
bank in the 80s from Neville and from the
[SPEAKER_00]: years of census.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep Okay amnesia fucking haze US
obviously, but I mean you can't really
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about that era of clones within the
world without mentioning amnesia haze I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, I think I think amnesia haze is sort
of like I You know, I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong here, but I associate amnesia haze
with after Neville put out super silver
[SPEAKER_00]: haze and mango haze and and Neville's haze
and sort of stopped contributing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and greenhouse sort of reconstituted their
seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That was one of the that was the
thing that came out after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah For the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so some sort of super silver
haze And so there's an aspect where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this is highly disputed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one take this the wrong way But if
you listen to Neville and Shanti they
[SPEAKER_00]: claim that after Neville's experience at
sensei They didn't want to give Arjun all
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones and seeds and and all that So
they controlled all that and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: gave greenhouse flower and seed for sale
Yeah, so when they left to do their own
[SPEAKER_00]: thing Arjun had probably the most famous
at the time between him and sensei He had
[SPEAKER_00]: the most famous award-winning seed bank
and He is his breeders left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and So he brought on Franco and
rumor is is that he bought 20 or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand euros worth of his own seed stock
Yeah, and they started breeding it and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing various things trying to come up
with Seed for their seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think that's where like
Arjun's haze one through five and amnesia
[SPEAKER_00]: haze and You know lemon this and all that
started happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, and that's that's amnesia
haze to me Yeah, I don't remember who did
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like high pro or order lab
or one of them made amnesia or amnesia I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't remember the fucking story,
but it's it's not it's not Soma or Whoever
[SPEAKER_02]: else people are saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's I think it's one of
those things too that like it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those renames that like they took some
other haze in Amsterdam to sell at coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shops and like We did in Kush in LA and
just give it a name That one's it's Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's a almost fruity floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way I can describe it to a
penalty, but it's it's nice It's a
[SPEAKER_02]: resonance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see why it was passed around for so
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's consistently a great haze I think I
like I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's good Did you ever run any
blue cheese?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, did you have a cut you liked or they
passed around?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were chatting about those those
Ron's parties and where a lot of us were
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering in those years there was a lot
of cool things crossed to the blue family
[SPEAKER_00]: and While I didn't really like a lot of
the straight blue stuff Yeah, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcrosses were really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was blue widow blue cheese Blue
rhino blue rhino There was a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different blue hybrids outcrosses that I
actually preferred that the straight blue
[SPEAKER_00]: lines Yeah, and blue cheese was one of
those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, so I didn't grow it A
bunch or anything like that, but it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a pretty sweet floral You know
Slightly skunk one ish type plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I mean there was there was
a bunch of seeds passed around by friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, it wasn't just a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it was like, you know, there was
there was people that crosses and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was f2s Yeah, so did you ever have any
experience with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I did make a blue cheese with the
blue bonnet that I really enjoy and and
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just because so many people over
the years asked me if I had a good blue
[SPEAKER_02]: cheese that I would recommend I'm like
blue fucking cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not want anything to do with cheese
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was everywhere It was a British thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during those years like when I heard
blue cheese doesn't I'm not regressive,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I did find that it is a fucking
amazing combo and I was just being an
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole You cross cool things to skunk one
and nice things come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's been a breeder standard
for decades Here's one that's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: self-serving, but it was so huge and
insane Diego that I think it was pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: huge everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually bubble berry Bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, did you have those cuts up
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had some bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was it was first offered by
sag Martha Yeah, thank right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep You know DJ short sent a bunch of blue
family seeds to sag Martha for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: retail them through their their business
Yeah, and Tony crossed some blue work You
[SPEAKER_00]: know to some bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and the bubble berry was born and the
and the bubble gum is famously mold
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant and throws a very consistent
type afghan beautiful plant yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the above the blueberry added turps
and color and some frost and some
[SPEAKER_00]: attractiveness and some other weird stuff
and So there was a good cut that floated
[SPEAKER_00]: around that everybody kind of loved Yeah
Yeah, no, it was it was well loved in San
[SPEAKER_02]: Diego, too It was one of my favorite
strains the the the big Lee to pink bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: gum with heavy heavy like blueberry jam
it's insane and and What's funny is I look
[SPEAKER_02]: at the old pictures of bubble berry from
Tony back in the day and he obviously used
[SPEAKER_02]: The same line of bubble gum that we used
however It wasn't the same clone and and
[SPEAKER_02]: the blue mill we used was loop on it and
they used a blueberry mill Which similar
[SPEAKER_02]: lines however, they look uncannily similar
when crossed and I it might be because
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble gum breed So true, you know like it
but it looks damn similar even all these
[SPEAKER_02]: years separated different parentage But
similar similar lineage They it is it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: cool looking plant and it's very
consistent when crossed even even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same family Yeah, and it's it there's cool
pictures of it from olden times from the
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s Matt various breeders have done work
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep You did work with it Bogg did stuff
with it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know Bogg bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that based on it in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he was that was Bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think it was bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, anyway, it was it was it was it
was a cool line It's it's a good example
[SPEAKER_00]: of how when two things that are very
different from each other come together
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You can pop some cool plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people are still talking about blue
rhino blue this blue that blue the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: outcrosses I'll say this too there was a
very limited number of people outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam seed banks in the late 90s and
early 2000s that got famous on the forums
[SPEAKER_00]: and There were certain forums of watching
of some blueberry grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep got everybody hyped on blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and so people started getting
blueberry and since it was obviously reg
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds they started crossing it to other
lines and That's when all those cool
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like in the early 2000s blue and blue
and white hybrids What the white widow
[SPEAKER_00]: family and the blue family they were
crossed to all kinds of things including
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep All right Maui waui I This is kind of
a weird one because it's one of those ones
[SPEAKER_02]: where I a lot of people don't see the same
Maui waui twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Maui waui is a lot like the
Alaskan Thunderfuck or krippi or Diesel or
[SPEAKER_00]: you know fire Yeah, you know it was
probably it was probably a sativa afghan
[SPEAKER_00]: grown on Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it rhymes And that makes it easy
to sell and so it was probably applied to
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of different types of Hawaiian
weed Yeah, I think that's probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: most accurate thing to say about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's that's that's fair
How about lamb's bread or lamb's breath?
[SPEAKER_00]: or Whatever, you know, I don't have any
personal experience with that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was supposed to be a wild sativa
like 2025 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it came out of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and was supposed to be pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was before Jamaica got inundated with
Your European weed strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and started growing mostly Dutch
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep and As a result of that it's a little
bit before my time and I don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: but I ever saw one the I believe was true.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the only one that I remember
seeing and I'm like Okay, that makes sense
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long flowering Indian sativa type
This was the pictures from Jason King and
[SPEAKER_02]: the Canna Bible when he went to Jamaica
Had to pay them fucking shitload of money
[SPEAKER_00]: to take pictures of their crops Yeah,
I mean I'll say the more fault,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the the the expression on that
one I could see that thing taking 24
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah easily easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that thing's a Calyxi mess Okay,
um Let's move on to Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there are certain clones of Malawi
passed up in certain clones of Malawi
[SPEAKER_02]: passed around up in Humboldt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah nor Cal I should say I had a Malawi
That its biggest issue was that it it
[SPEAKER_00]: never wanted to finish for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is not a convenient trait You
know and You know Malawi is one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things where there's a lot Africa is
probably The continent with the most weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have the least amount of its
genetics That like fresh genetics over
[SPEAKER_00]: here Yeah, it seems like there was an
initial seeding during like the slave
[SPEAKER_00]: trade era When there was an enormous
amount of ships coming from Africa to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Caribbean and stuff like that Yeah,
so a lot of like maybe Mexican and
[SPEAKER_00]: Caribbean weed ancient origins tied to
there but you talk about the Congo and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi and the this and that and
everything else and You know, maybe Durban
[SPEAKER_00]: is the most common thing that we have from
Africa Swazi and Durban There's this
[SPEAKER_00]: there's stuff that rolled all that a lot
of that African weed rolls right through
[SPEAKER_00]: the equatorial region Yeah, which means
that it takes forever which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a ginormous pain in the ass for
anyone in America unless it's crossed to
[SPEAKER_00]: something Afghan that makes it Yep,
and by manageable we usually mean like 12
[SPEAKER_00]: or 14 or 15 weeks or something There's a
red Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty tightly held by some people
that they love Yeah, that's that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crossed to some very Afghan thing
to get it I remember that red Congo is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Congo Afghani or something like The
Malawi or like there's you got to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit to tame it yeah You live in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't live in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah super hard to get those to flower
under like reasonable times indoors to
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you know like 24 weeks something and
it's like unless you start light depping
[SPEAKER_00]: it in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not making your season Yeah,
you're screwed, you know, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it inside and it's like this jungle
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's leafy It takes like six months like,
you know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah It's hard Apollo let's just say let's
let's call this the the the Brothers Grimm
[SPEAKER_02]: when I see Brothers Grimm I mean sly and
it with Some assistance from soul and
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me throw in one more thing here as we
chat about this stuff There's tons of cool
[SPEAKER_00]: comments and various questions popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the rate we're talking about stuff
There's no chance I have to answer even
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, we're going through it like
Categorized list this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard to answer questions at
rapid fire, you know But if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: important to you remember them and you can
hit me up about them later So yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to throw that out there join
us on the patreon discord and we like she
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about this shit all the time So you
can ask us anything all the time and get
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah from people smarter than myself,
you know So we're gonna call this the the
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers Grimm selection of clones,
which is princess cafe girl fucking ginger
[SPEAKER_02]: ale cut We got what else we got Princess
Cafe girl blah blah blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh genius genius Which leads to the Apollo
13 the the special cuts of that the Apollo
[SPEAKER_02]: 11?
[SPEAKER_02]: All that good stuff all that good stuff
c99 pineapple What which which of those do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have experience with them though this
this this ties into a bunch of stuff I
[SPEAKER_00]: already said but I would say that just
like DJ the original Brothers Grimm Crew
[SPEAKER_00]: came out at a time when there wasn't very
many non-dutch readers doing things
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly So a lot of their work got
heavily spread amongst the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially the early forum community
Yeah, just like DJ short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said became famous Brothers Grimm
became pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was endless posts on fucking cubing
and how he took the the original seed he
[SPEAKER_00]: got from the Jacarera and turned it into
c99 And you know the Apollo 11 the Apollo
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 the genius There was a whole bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again when I was going to those parties
of Ron's a lot of the things that were the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that was the most common to be
crossed with Was the blue family the white
[SPEAKER_00]: family?
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder Steve's work and a lot of Brothers
Grimm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I loved the genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew with the I had the Apollo and the
genius in that era I got them from friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that I met through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were both nice smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I thought I've always
thought this Cinderella 99 was a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit ish Yeah, I loved absolutely
loved the pineapple Fino c99.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a sucker for it turpentine and
pineapple together make it taste like
[SPEAKER_02]: pineapple I was fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my brothers here was really famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that Era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so a lot of their stuff was getting
passed around a lot of their straight
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that people found they got names
and Hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would um, I did a lot of work with
Apollo 13 that's when I chose between the
[SPEAKER_02]: 11 and The 13 I chose the 13 had a lot of
really nice great phenos come out of that
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some good lemon phenos that were
more dense and Afghani looking then the
[SPEAKER_02]: the great super sativa purple looking
pretty shit, but Yeah, I maybe we should
[SPEAKER_00]: know that what we're talking about is the
original Organization of Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know anything about the
second iteration of the second one where
[SPEAKER_00]: where the sly wasn't involved and mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soul and and You know Duke had something
going on like that was I mean there was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 15 year break or something where
there was no seat Yeah, so we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the early late Early 2000s first
when they first got famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not they were reconstituted Decades
later not when the marketing guy tried to
[SPEAKER_02]: put it back together put the team back
together without the team Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's skip through those we did shoreline
Here's one that I I have some interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: info on but I can't say who aware RFK
skunk RFK skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean RFK skunk was supposedly You know
skunk It's got a lot of things right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's RFK is is where the the Washington
Redskins played right The Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a bunch of dead shows They was
on the when they would do their summer
[SPEAKER_00]: tour Yeah, RFK was was one of the big
stadiums that they would always play in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know and all that and supposedly
that RFK Came out of bud from RFK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm beating myself up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I just realized that RFK is probably
gonna pop up tomorrow and some lamer's
[SPEAKER_02]: list of stuff that they're claiming to
have but Yeah, it got mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like so there's a there's a whole
series of like Mysterious East Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: skunks from the same area some might be
renames Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been rumored to be in a bunch
of different things But proof is low Yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps yeah Yeah, we'll see we'll see one
might be out there of this and it'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and gonna see about it So I'm
pretty stoked because it's one that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's very little info about out there
as far as what it was like Like I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned with the headband story before
Manny and those others cleared it up where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's very little info But it's still
fairly famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows a lot of room for people to say
Whatever they like about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because there's very little
verifiable info So maybe that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: verifiable info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't know, you know Romulan
Romulan is another one that is weird in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that there's a lot of funky
stories about it And and they keep getting
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier and earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what we know for sure is that it
It's Canadian You know, that's where it
[SPEAKER_00]: got famous and when it I believe it
basically got first like nationally or
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally famous when the Canadian
seed companies Started jumping into the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed game and there was a lot of hybrids
crossed Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and there's some stories about that
it came from Mendo and like and Mendo Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was brought to British Columbia it
was this and this and It came back and
[SPEAKER_00]: these crazy early years yeah, I don't know
what you think of that Matt, but From
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that I've researched on it
talking to people at BC and Other parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada who were around during that time
and had interaction with those crews
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino Joe was a hundred thousand
percent not Romulan Joe Romulan was also
[SPEAKER_02]: not from the 40s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it was from the fucking 90s
and if I remember correctly and I'm only
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only repeating because I I'm not from
Canada, obviously Port Albany pine bud was
[SPEAKER_02]: one of its first names and there was
another name something blue indica with
[SPEAKER_02]: and then later on It was made popular in
the 90s with the different name change But
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it's not a there's no such thing as
a 1940s Afghani hybrid So it's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those things when I hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes my eyes cross And it's also
it's also kind of kind of a cool thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that a lot of cannabis names
were very much tongue-in-cheek About like
[SPEAKER_00]: pop culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so Romulan is actually,
you know, obviously it's a race of aliens
[SPEAKER_00]: from Star Trek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so already Star Trek So Star Trek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the Romulan did you ever have
that grapefruit Romulan or the Gromulan?
[SPEAKER_02]: No No, yeah, it was okay It was a weird
one that went around San Diego a bunch and
[SPEAKER_02]: like no matter what clones you were trying
to chase you'd always end up Right back
[SPEAKER_02]: It's square one with Gromulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about just grapefruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grapefruit there was a You know,
there's a there's a pretty famous fino of
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma's diesel mm-hmm that had grapefruit
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and some people bred with it and
Loved it a ton and it had really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is about as far from sour
turps as you can imagine But yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, nonetheless, they really loved it And
that's the only like and that's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: real grapefruit I have ever I've ever
experienced there was a real popular Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: most Finos of c99 that are popped from
seed come out very Grapefruity to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells what's weird is when people's
explain grapefruit and give me grapefruit
[SPEAKER_02]: budget like super grapefruit I always
smell fucking perfume.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things where I just
smell it's so much different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah People are talking about all kinds of
skunks and stuff like that and I'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: something real quick I do think in the 90s
skunk was a much more prevalent odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it popped up in hybrids a lot
more frequently But you know skunk bud
[SPEAKER_00]: tended to not be quite as potent as some
other weed And it had really noticeable
[SPEAKER_00]: turps that got you in trouble And so I
think it just got selected away from too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah In by various people and then as as
clones changed and names changed people
[SPEAKER_00]: went to different stuff and everyone
assumed that people would be holding it
[SPEAKER_00]: and Now it seems like a lost turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know and it's also possible It
could be a little bit of a recessive turp
[SPEAKER_00]: now where it needs other genes from
another partner to like make it pop Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're buried double up double up
where in the 90s maybe it was an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: double up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm and now 30 years Later,
it's like a rarer double up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Because you've talked you've talked
about I can't remember who made it but you
[SPEAKER_00]: were telling me What was the sour dub
Fino?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a diesel or soured up across
to rehearse diesel for the panel Sourdough
[SPEAKER_00]: by diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Matt's crossed diesel to all
kinds of things and one time this one
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid All of a sudden throws,
you know a much more Skunky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think that's probably Where
it'll pop back up again is will be it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lucky recessive combo Yeah,
I know crybaby did a GMO diesel that I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought would probably hold it pretty well
or even a D diesel or any of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: any any combination of the The like sour
version of super skunk and the short squat
[SPEAKER_02]: version of super skunk to me seems to just
kind of bring it up Quite well quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean I think if you start crossing
I mean we've talked about that a bunch we
[SPEAKER_00]: start crossing different skunky things and
large enough numbers Yeah, and you'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's just not gonna be
across the skunk one will take you farther
[SPEAKER_02]: away from your goal than closer Yeah,
there's see a lot of people that have had
[SPEAKER_02]: sour dub Some people look at me like silly
when I say sour dub You can grow up very
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking skunky if you know how to bring
out skunkiness out of strains But some
[SPEAKER_02]: people are just like, you know,
I never never see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know Some people have had really
loud sour done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never sure if it's the same load or
just way different grow styles I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely I you know,
my friend that I visited he grows a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil Yeah, and I definitely noticed
like a pretty extreme sweetness To a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things, you know, so I definitely think
you know room temperature and feeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: You know type of feeding and stuff like
that can certainly different plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely bring out different aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So so one that was big around the
forums during overgrown era, I believe was
[SPEAKER_02]: Jackie O Did you ever see Jackie O?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a I believe Jack flash,
you know cross the Calio Indeed that was
[SPEAKER_02]: in Naboo one if I remember correctly,
it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good Calio hybrid Did it taste
like citrus or did it go beyond that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was super citrus and super to
penalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Yeah, yeah two extreme flavors
combined in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes super citrus and super tour penalty So
then we obviously since we're bringing a
[SPEAKER_02]: Calio Bring up Calio in the Milton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any Calio?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Calio You know, it was one of those
things where Maybe the funniest thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: could tell about Calio is when tangy came
out and got popular And people were lining
[SPEAKER_00]: up to buy tons of seeds from DNA and tangy
hybrids A lot of us up here in Mendo were
[SPEAKER_00]: shocked because you know five or ten years
before Yeah, trying to give away pure
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus smelling Pounds was a tough sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah was it was that was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a there was a limited limited
market and you would get told no a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: headache we A lot of the pure citrus stuff
whether it was the lemon G or the Calio or
[SPEAKER_00]: the this or that if it's just one note
Citrus turp a lot of people will get hold
[SPEAKER_00]: on it fast So we were amazed when tangy
came out to such it was like citrus had
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten so Unpopular that it got eight had
a resurgence because no one had smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because no one none of the brokers
would buy it Yeah, and that's kind of how
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at cheese to like when it started
getting a big resurgence I was like cheese
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did it when I was down south.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get to grow out a lot of Caleb's
Calio hybrids Yeah, and you can really see
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sativa origins Pop through and
various and various things especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you cross it to other things that like to
stretch And You know, I'm not exactly sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is, but it's one of those original
clones that you know went over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and It sounds like it came
through Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Interesting, you know, he wrote about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote about it in the first Canna Bible
in that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no But it people get over people get
over it because it's just it's orange Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not a fan spirit of 76.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever see that up there just in the
Canna Bible?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I see Pinkleberry that looks pretty
identical to it in that that super
[SPEAKER_02]: specific pink pistol trait But that
doesn't mean they're necessarily related
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was what I always wanted to see
and I always wondered if it passed around
[SPEAKER_00]: North Cal back there the thing that I'll
say about that and it has nothing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the spirit of 76, but it's that
growing a lot of the same Strains over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years indoor versus outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are strains that will give me
magenta or hot pink or Crazy colored,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know those hues pistols outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we'll never ever do it Inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they don't never ride to that
color Yeah, but there's a period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: during their flowering cycle where you can
get I have I mean I have a bunch on my
[SPEAKER_00]: phone you can get some really Amazing
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but only in the Sun Yeah,
it's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is weird and maybe it's I wonder
I wonder if one day the LEDs will somehow
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to capture that range that pushes
it out indoors I don't know that So
[SPEAKER_00]: someone just asked a pretty good question
when we said what does double up mean and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I what I mean by that and just like a
super quick genetics lesson and I'll use
[SPEAKER_00]: humans as the because that's easier than
plants is like having blue eyes green eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: Hazel eyes gray eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the only way your kids can get it
is if both parents have the gene Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right if they don't like for instance,
you know, I have I have I have multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: kids I have hazel eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife has green eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we both have the gene We got two brown
eyes and one blue-eyed kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right in three tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know what I mean by double we mean
by doubling up is I Think that that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular skunk aroma is probably
recessive now And you'd have to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: different parent that had that recessive
trait and grow enough of them that those
[SPEAKER_00]: two recessives met in one plant Yep lined
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we mean by doubling up because
if you don't have two parents with the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue-eyed gene You can't have a blue-eyed
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Same thing with blonde hair actually
Same thing with any number of traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that humans eventually will all
be some kind of brown-eyed Just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so dominant in so many cultures that
you know And I think that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened to skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just got lost and now it'll pop out on
rare cases Mr. Toad does not have a strain
[SPEAKER_02]: that produces pink pistol inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Toad is full of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see we got the whites from
Chrome You know, you might remember more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the history about it than I do I
Classify it in the same way as the snow
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe some other things One of those
low terpene low flavor chunky frosty
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that tend to transfer that when you
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it got mixed into a bunch of
stuff Yeah, it was the white because of
[SPEAKER_02]: how frosty it was Yeah, it was from from
chrome from swamp boys was the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: brought it online I don't remember where
he said he sourced it from somewhere in
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida I remember there was some talk
around the time too that it was called a
[SPEAKER_02]: white triangle or just triangle But not
triangle cush remember there was some
[SPEAKER_02]: speculation on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I hear it That is I wish
we could have chrome lawn to talk about a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit I was associated with like in
my head with the hash plant meaning that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a plant that is solely for producing
hash or adding tons of resin, but it also
[SPEAKER_02]: adds earth and dirt and mushrooms Terps so
it might be one of those things like I
[SPEAKER_00]: never used to talk about the nl5 Yeah,
how it added frost and structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: improved lead lead You know kale,
it's the leaf ratio Yeah, but it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: taste like much or smell like much which
he liked because it let the other side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding shine through Yes,
so it added and I that's kind of how I
[SPEAKER_02]: think of the white It did amazing with the
blue bonnet and let the blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_02]: dominate it which is really weird for like
that recessive blue terp in the first
[SPEAKER_02]: place that blue smell and That's the one
thing that I found that really married
[SPEAKER_02]: with the white Well in a single f1 hybrid
usually it takes some back-crossing to to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of Those turps to the white and
that's kind of a common old-school way of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding where you take something that's
Frosty and dense with nice structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: potent But maybe doesn't have a lot of
smell or flavor and you throw that on
[SPEAKER_00]: something Wilder growing with better turps
and better this and better that and you
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you can get Both qualities in one
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, so Let's see fucking
incredible Not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have to say let me let me add
this in to is that someone just someone
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that they think that the citrus
turps took off with dabs And I do think
[SPEAKER_00]: that tangy came out at the perfect time
because a lot of that citrus weed is
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty low potency to moderate at best
Yeah, but if you make bho of it and you
[SPEAKER_00]: make it 78 percent THC you're gonna get
high if you take a dab Yep, so in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower form year Before it would just get
it would just be weaker and wouldn't stay
[SPEAKER_00]: around long Yeah, but what you could put
it through bho and that citrus turp would
[SPEAKER_00]: come through whether it was lemon or
orange or tangerine or whatever Your brain
[SPEAKER_00]: picked up on and it would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so for it for it was perfect timing
for extract Yeah anyway black Russian I
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't really have any experience with
black Russian cherry aka blackberry
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful beautiful magenta colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was before Chitrali was super popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So People weren't used to seeing those
beautiful magenta colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's responsible for like double purple
Doja and Sputnik and a few other things
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly just like the blackberry but with
better cherry nicer Turps and a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more resinous than blackberry but still
overall pretty low potency and and mids
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty low potency Yeah, unfortunately,
I spent a lot of time on black Russian a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot because I was convinced I could pull
something good out of it and I never was
[SPEAKER_02]: able to doesn't mean it can't be done I
was just not able to and I tried a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean it was kind of this like that
black the blackberry kush that we had in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo was kind of the same Yeah,
it was incredible looking and people loved
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow it and it would be absolutely
gorgeous And then sometime you just
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that you didn't really get very
high from from smoking it I'm some I just
[SPEAKER_02]: seen the same thing up over and over about
20 times Asian fantasy We're not talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about Asian fantasy only because that was
a clone that was supposedly never passed
[SPEAKER_02]: ever Yeah, and that's it So there's nobody
has any experience with it except for
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason King and the guy that wouldn't give
it out There was scammers that claimed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have it and trade it out for a long time
and they still claim to have it and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: stupid Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those strains like I I don't
know like creepy People just make shit up
[SPEAKER_02]: just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um West Coast dog, do you have experience
with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I you know, I wish we have we have
some friends that have more experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with it that are chatting on here than I
do I never really grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did seem like it was one of those big
yielding You know that they could pass
[SPEAKER_00]: this chem So it got grown in a lot of
greenhouses and a lot of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But I don't remember its origin story
off the top of my head And that game
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking if you've ever smoked cam or
smoke Smelled cam you'd be like what it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a it's it's above a hybrid probably of
some sort It does real well outdoors
[SPEAKER_02]: because people could move it out is
indoors It just was one of those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that could one of those Transitory plants
you could pass off as indoor and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I mean the brokers There's always
been a history of brokers where if they
[SPEAKER_00]: could make depths look like ends Or they
could they thought that outs looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: depths then they could get a higher price
For from their customers and then their
[SPEAKER_00]: margin would be bigger, which is the point
of their existence Yes, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was like a big I don't know I think
it was one of those ones that it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: a big growing Afghan That was kind of
boring, but yeah, it got cam attached to
[SPEAKER_02]: it Let's see what else we got here purple
mister nice I know that one up in your
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you did you grow any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice is a little weird in the sense
That it It's got g3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposedly got g13 in it Yeah,
you know and it's one of those things that
[SPEAKER_00]: when when Neville lost when we never went
to jail For 11 months and then since he
[SPEAKER_00]: got him out of spent since he gave him a
bunch of money And got him out of jail and
[SPEAKER_00]: bought his seed company Some of the things
that were common in Neville seed catalog
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't port over yeah to sensei like any
of the g13 hybrids and Any of the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: The maple leaf all disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then in the late 90s after
Neville left the maple leaf the g13 the
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani one all those things started
popping back up Yeah, and I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: they pulled them from seed, but I think
that's where it came from Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: is mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sensei offering first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right and it was a g13 by hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah You know ash plant at all once Yeah,
yeah, it just it was like every single g13
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant that was purple to me It was it
was narcotic enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it yielded really well and the
better it yielded the worse it was Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean so it's one of those things
where I always question is like Why did it
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear the whole time Neville was
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then after he left to got
brought back like why didn't it state?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never gotten the answers to that why
didn't the hash plants in the G13s and the
[SPEAKER_00]: maples and some of those other things why
did they go off the menu?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then ten years later pop off
back on them Any mangoes that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: remember there's a ginormous mango That
old-school seed line that floats around
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo Because people used to be able to
get eight or ten pounds of plant off it
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they called it the mango around
here, and then obviously there's the mango
[SPEAKER_00]: haze But I don't know which one he's
referring to yeah, I'm not sure I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: just mango or in general mango marijuana
You know I don't really I I've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: various tales About that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it was supposedly grown a lot in
Trinity County you know and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely potent I had a friend that used
to move a lot of it But I never had I
[SPEAKER_02]: never grew it Yeah, I grew a bunch of the
seed line the name was a total to me it
[SPEAKER_02]: was a Misnomer I tried tux I tried motor
roles tried sanny's which was motor
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have anything I liked it was very
low potency Some of it was resinous
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled like leather which is just not my
my gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the puck?
[SPEAKER_00]: The puck You know I we both have some
experience with the puck the puck is
[SPEAKER_00]: supposedly a Hash plant you know from
Neville from the Neville seed bank era in
[SPEAKER_00]: the late 80s yeah, it came out of You know
it got famous in Colorado and Leadville
[SPEAKER_00]: and various places like that Some
old-schoolers used to carry it around in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hockey puck hard case And that's kind of
how it got the name the puck And it's
[SPEAKER_00]: around and people breed with it I never
had very much luck with it because when I
[SPEAKER_00]: had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was primarily using the Sun Yeah,
and it grew worthless weed in the Sun
[SPEAKER_00]: about either outdoor or greenhouse I've
written like my head stash beds which
[SPEAKER_00]: produced a whole bunch of gorgeous weed
And that stuff was leafy took forever
[SPEAKER_00]: almost resinous But you know inside people
get better better results off it You know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of another one of those like old
Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really ugly by today's standards
Yeah And probably is best in a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project Probably its best trait is that
it's got very old genetics in it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not like a one hybrid,
and you're done No, I you know I anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: working with it more power to it for
trying That's all I'll say on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a multi-stage process to get
what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And this is it for the list right now
You got me on yours No, I didn't write me
[SPEAKER_00]: down I saw you had such a huge list yeah
you know there's a Yum bolt I Never grew
[SPEAKER_00]: the young bolt, but I actually used to
strangely enough I used to get young bolt
[SPEAKER_00]: from Humboldt and whoever had the young
bolt And Humboldt was doing a good job,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was frosty and burned good,
and I enjoyed smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know People are talking about you
know yeah There's people out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing some extensive puck work,
and I think that's probably what it would
[SPEAKER_00]: take Yeah, yeah, it would it would take
I'm not saying it's bad, or I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: dissing it I'm just saying that like to
get the qualities you want out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to work with it for a
while and do three four You know five
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of breeding, and you'll probably
get it to somewhere where you want To go
[SPEAKER_02]: if I was being optimistic I would say
cross once to the puck and then cross to
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else for like nine generations
No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's I'm sure people are doing great
work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't run any and that's that's
the main thing Island sweet skunk I could
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that for a second it It's
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stories around about it Supposedly
it was an alien again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck it up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you say it so I will I Can't
fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember so but I think it's
cotton candy was a rename of ISS or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that The sweet skunk the
sweet skunk was supposedly an nl5 haze
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe mixed with something from from
breeder Steve and then the island sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk You know was I don't know like It
kind of got like fucked up with Mark
[SPEAKER_00]: Emory, and he decided to like rename
something because he wanted something
[SPEAKER_00]: different sounding on his menu So I don't
know but apparently it still lives in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada There's people that know the real
story and have an original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been held around for a long time And
it's likely an nl5 haze or hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Irene we're not going to talk about
just because we might have Some people on
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually that it's kind of their story
to tell and they can give an enormous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of depth on it Yeah, so hopefully
that'll be soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Yep Casey Jones is that it was a
similar era.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a cut from Joe Schmoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty good at Casey Jones That's
about all I got on now anything else you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to cover before we wrap this one up
and if we missed any again Send us
[SPEAKER_02]: messages some of the ones people were
mentioning you guys missed it earlier in
[SPEAKER_02]: the episode summer and other episodes We
have all episodes about so go check them
[SPEAKER_02]: out Anything else you want to cover before
I start doing a bullshit or about that
[SPEAKER_00]: time 850 or something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Oh, I'll see somebody just asked
about champagne Champagne was a Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and there was this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if it was in the in
Emory's magazine cannabis culture or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever but there was there was these
video there was these pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: Champagne that were just like three foot
tall colas With very little branching on
[SPEAKER_00]: like a hydroponic setup and it just looked
like there was like five pounds of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah on this table and it was very it was
very delicious looking and I think there
[SPEAKER_00]: was some really Attractive pictures of
champagne taken they got a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in it And it was seed lines that
was crossed into stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of one of those things I don't
know that we ever saw the real one down in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say but it definitely was passed
around Let those 90s beaster circles Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yeah Someone was talking about
what was in it the king and champagne a
[SPEAKER_02]: funny story about the king I almost popped
the last of those seeds and then I agreed
[SPEAKER_02]: to do a collab with why East and Come up
when he was with compound The seeds got
[SPEAKER_02]: given to his partner of king and I never
saw them again So you look at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure compound might have a king hybrid
somewhere and I think maybe there's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance Like we have some Canadian friends
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I think it still survives
up there Yeah, it could very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's mostly it's most but the
history on it is mostly Canadian Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of things people are asking
about like the Canadian stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to talk about but I just don't
Have any experience with Canadian stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: other than what we could buy from seed up
there and it was still minimal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Yeah, we had this we had this
line from my friends in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the Hong Kong I don't know if
that's what people are talking about or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking about a different Kong But
yeah, we had this thing called the Hong
[SPEAKER_00]: Kong that still exists in various hybrids
So the calling if I remember correctly had
[SPEAKER_02]: this reputation for being sold for some
ridiculous amount of money like $20,000
[SPEAKER_02]: for a cut Yeah And so assassin was not
just ojiko solo sessions were all hybrids
[SPEAKER_02]: of oj.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have the number one in our circle
Number three was a Oracle hybrid and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: gone as far as I know Yeah, so we've been
doing a lot of updates to the Podcasts
[SPEAKER_02]: we're on every single platform now that
you can imagine for podcasting and we put
[SPEAKER_02]: these videos up on YouTube pretty shortly

answer them for you I saw a bunch scroll
[SPEAKER_00]: past and it just wasn't easy to stop what
we were talking about and tangent That
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean it wasn't a good one Yeah
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you everyone for showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you guys have a wonderful weekend And
we'll see you next week same back time
[SPEAKER_02]: same back channel You
