[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_00]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_00]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get started, I just wanted to
let you know that over at riotseeds.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're about to drop some new goat farm
gear, some of the last of the Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminize Hybrids, and we have the whole
Blue in Cross lineup, Blue IX.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm called Blue 9, but it's Blue IX,
Blue in Cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's half off right now,
so talking $100 and $80 a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be sure to go check that out at
riotseeds.com, and we have some high and
[SPEAKER_01]: lonesome stuff still.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some stuff from Mad Elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it out while it's still going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sale's probably going to end in about
a week and a half, so keep your eyes
[SPEAKER_01]: peeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only at riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me, and I'm by myself, which I hate
more than anyone even knows doing solo
[SPEAKER_01]: shows, but I haven't done a show on
reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reversals in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of the reversal shows were kind of
bullshit, like I had a co-partner that had
[SPEAKER_01]: never reversed anything and decided to
interject his opinion on the history of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, how it's done, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's time to correct the record on some
of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I took a bunch of questions from the
Discord, and if you're not a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Discord, go to our Patreon, join it,
$5 a month, all the way up to $50 a month
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want special goodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every three months or so, unreleased
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, possibly one of these months
I'll be doing maybe, maybe be doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: reversal spray, at least in a small
portion so people can get an idea of a
[SPEAKER_01]: one-plant reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, my history in reversals
goes back since 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jimbo Hogg Gonzales really taught me how
to reverse the creator of Hogg's Breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with him, I had a few other
special mentors, which I will name,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are Ernesto from Buddhist Seeds,
again, not big Buddhist Seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: never interacted with Milo, Buddhist Seeds
Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another person that helped a lot
despite him not being a big fan of
[SPEAKER_01]: reversals at the time, and I don't know
that he is right now either, is Shanty
[SPEAKER_01]: Bala.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shanty was a major part of me
understanding the process, how to go about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, all the reasons why he hated it and
didn't love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I took it from a different
position at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost all seeds were regs, unless made in
Amsterdam, and it was looked down upon to
[SPEAKER_01]: do reversals and, you know, I'm a fucking
villain, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'll start off with the
first question from Yahweh, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: Yahweh, seven-tooth 33.
[SPEAKER_01]: First question, and this is the first
question I always get, STS versus
[SPEAKER_01]: colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colloidal silver is capable of reversing
some plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the best thing to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, there was a paper by
Mohan Raminset, and this is the landmark
[SPEAKER_01]: paper, I believe it was late 70s,
early 80s, where they were comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: different reversal types and STS,
which is silver, nitrate, sodium,
[SPEAKER_01]: thiosulfate combination seemed to work
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was reliably able to reverse plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, of course, there weren't as
many polyhybrids or shitty super Afghani
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant hybrids that they were trying to
reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things have definitely changed over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second question is how does gibrelic acid
come into play?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now GA3 only comes into play when I'll say
gibrelic acid number three, specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: comes into play in a more advanced
technique, and I wouldn't use it by
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, but I will bring it up later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jazzmonic acid for masculine ice seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know nothing about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do use a different reversal agent for
reversing a male to a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about jazzmonic acid
or masculine ice seeds for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commander Cochran asks, I have a nice
female plant that I would like to sell to
[SPEAKER_01]: get some seed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, how many plants should I consider
using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've heard us talk on the show a lot
about reversals, it's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go in and you reverse one plant and
think that's going to do it and knock up
[SPEAKER_01]: your whole room, odds are slim to none
that you're not going to have a successful
[SPEAKER_01]: reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have it one to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have 36 plants, I want six plants
I'm reversing and so on and so up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the safe bet, but it's not always
foolproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not always foolproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plants that are very stubborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even CSI has talked about Triangle,
Skittles, ChemDogD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these are very hard to reverse and
sometimes six plants won't be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second question from Commander Cochran.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I flip the donor one week,
two weeks ahead of the receipt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're reversing hemp, you flip them at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp drops pollen so fast that I don't
know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of time, maybe it's because people
are popping hemp seed and just reversing
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed as opposed to clones of said hemp
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that case, you flip them at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are using something, say,
Giesel, I would stagger it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to do six plants,
two plants, two and a half weeks ahead,
[SPEAKER_01]: enter in two more plants, two weeks ahead,
enter in two more plants, one and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks ahead, and start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stagger them in and keep reversing them as
you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for that is it takes a lot
longer for pollen to drop and for
[SPEAKER_01]: receivers to receive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want receivers to be receiving at the
optimum time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not want receivers to be receiving
to be receiving after the hairs have died
[SPEAKER_01]: off because that defeats the purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dino Grow asks, is there a difference in
seeds from a partially reversed and
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinating the same plant from
pollinating another female plant of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go reread this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a difference in seeds from a
partially reversed and pollinating the
[SPEAKER_01]: same plant from pollinating another female
plant of the same strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I pollinate half a plant and consume
the other half?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it still be quality bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like they're trying to do
half and half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend it because one,
you barely get any plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get as many seeds in a reversal
as you would a regular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, trying to control the pollen is a
bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't recommend doing any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possible, not probable, not advisable.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stink Box says, when I reversed a male,
it grew flowers all over, but in each
[SPEAKER_01]: flower it would throw a couple of nanners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, it pulled for dumping pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the sacks because I should have used
more spray or because that's just the way
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you reverse a male to produce
female flowers, it will be making female
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers on a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is to say, it won't have the same
bract structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason you're reversing the plant
isn't to pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason you're reversing the plant is
to get an idea of what scents,
[SPEAKER_01]: the resin production, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you actually go and use that plant
in a real setting, not reversing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see some of those traits pop
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only reason people are doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why the seed question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand any of it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a basic chemistry
understanding, would a DIY recipe be fine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have you figured out something your
spray that makes it better, more
[SPEAKER_01]: effective, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the DIY recipe of, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't fucking remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember it off the top of my
head, but yes, there is definitely more
[SPEAKER_01]: effective ways to do it than just using
the DIY recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a reason that people modify
it over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Ben Chicken, do you use gibberellic
acid reversal spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, do you find it helps elongate the
male flow clusters more like a true male?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much GA3 do you use per 100
milliliters to achieve a good amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: elongation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're talking about here is
advanced reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just say real quickly,
it's because these aren't really like
[SPEAKER_01]: ordered super well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When using gibberellic acid number three,
the only reason I would use it is if I
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed a hard cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you reverse a plant, a female
plant, you're going to get male parts on a
[SPEAKER_01]: female clustering hard nubbed plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like a male that just
drops pollen and leans all over and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that jazz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times when it gets too hard
clustered, one of the tricks to use is 75
[SPEAKER_01]: PPMs of gibberellic acid number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't always work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't know how to make
gibberellic acid number three using
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, crushing it all down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all water soluble as it claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe somewhere in our Patreon
discord, there is a recipe for making the
[SPEAKER_01]: gibberellic acid number three in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, beginner question on reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say I have two different cuts that I
really like and want to make a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it matter which one I reverse just
for this one cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just luck of the draw?
[SPEAKER_01]: Edit, I should specify regarding traits
presuming both plants reverse pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like CSI did reversing Chem D to Chem 91
and then vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the question is there really any
difference to plant receiving the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the plant donating the pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have more of a difference,
some have less of a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll see similar siblings
popping up in both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does matter what is the receiver and
which isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually the receiver is chosen by
whichever plant is easiest to reverse,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if Chem D is a bitch to reverse,
then reverse Chem 91, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes a lot into play of why we
choose what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say I have plant A and plant B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a noticeable difference in
progeny between AB and BA?
[SPEAKER_01]: If A is male, B is female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a difference in B?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we just answered this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any difference in general trend
in traits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just depends on what plants you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no hard fast rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably a question I get more
than anything is like, is there a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: fast rule on what's okay to reverse and
what's okay not to reverse?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's better?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no hard fast rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics line up the way they line up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a zipper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the zipper's off.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no hard fast rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: What week do you start using reversal and
what is the best dosing frequency?
[SPEAKER_01]: All that is on my page where you can go
buy my reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on sale as much as it's ever been
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check that out at seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go find the reversal spray sections,
three different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that info is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know it, it's because you
haven't done it and you haven't bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Complete newbie question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much spray would be needed to
recommend it for a small solo cup style
[SPEAKER_01]: fam project with just a couple plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the size of the plant matter when
attempting a reversal?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I said, it's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend just like willy-nilly
trying to do it off three plants in a solo
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really going to do too much for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the size of the plant matter when
attempting a reversal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously the bigger the plant,
the more the pollen if it reverses well.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when you start spraying it,
it almost almost almost always halts any
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you self one plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you sprayed one branch,
could you use the seeds from the other
[SPEAKER_01]: branches or should you have separate cuts
as receivers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand you usually spray the donor
ahead of the receivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't recommend doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely causes some issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you can't stagger that way and
stagger is necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bong tokes for Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed leading up to the spray after
favorite size to do the reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you go through so many plants known
keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes you say, holy shit,
I got to keep this one forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed leading up to the spray and after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing reversals, I like to
also include nitrogen throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: feed just because like you're making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're reversing, it's not going to
hurt it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you're going to go smoke it
and you're not going to go smoke the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff after.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend it anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you go through so many plants known
keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes you say, holy shit,
I got to keep this one forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: How that fucker smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the determining factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which plant was successful in reversing
but extremely difficult to complete?
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't reverse it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants you haven't been able to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times before you throw in the
towel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever reversed a long flowering
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Successful in reversing, but extremely
difficult to complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Won't reverse it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clockwork Orange was very, very hard to
reverse, but I did it a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were plenty of fails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know CSI would say the same about
Triangle Kush, Chemdog D and Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants you haven't been able to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did get the LA AFI to reverse once,
but it was only like six seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with Cherry Pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is weird because you'd think Cherry
Pie, Hermbalm might as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times before you throw in the
towel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty stubborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not been many times where I've
just been like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I was trying to reverse in the
first place, there was a necessary need
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever reversed a longer flowering
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did try with the Columbian Black,
but I didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 26-week flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I have tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did not succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you feed plants reversal would be some
good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Answered it yourself, Mr. Blue Grooves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed it to full range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any merit to hunting for female
pollen donors in the same manner that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would males?
[SPEAKER_01]: To determine which female produces the
best feminized offspring as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing my favorite female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single thing in there comes to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants are awesome on their own,
but breed for shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: CCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any protective equipment recommended when
spraying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I would have known this a long time
ago, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't wear masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the taste of STS being kind of
sweet because it's been in my mouth so
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you go about trying to lock in
traits such as nose and effect after
[SPEAKER_01]: selfing a plant with only one known
parent?
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, how much vigor and how much
harder is it to self a plant multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you tend to prefer back crossing over
S2, S3 to lock in traits at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to try to answer this
question as best as I can using an
[SPEAKER_01]: example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my my blue bonnet stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have the blue incross stuff,
which is like really, really worked blue
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet stuffs a few generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now I'm considering do I reverse
the blue incross because it's the best of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best in my opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I go pop some of the original F1
blue bonnet seeds that are left and try
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Only because taking stuff in to a further
self generation is like hyperspeed
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and hyperspeed inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recessives come out from that and
blueberry already has plenty of issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with recessives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure if it would be working in
a direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may all smell amazingly blueberry,
but also be mutated and grow like slow
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, there's different reasons
for different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't necessarily choose like back
crossing over S2s or S3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just work it forward, F1,
F2, F3, F4.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even with the bonnet stuff,
I did a blue bonnet F2, I did a blue
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet BX1, and I didn't do the S1 of that
one yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was more or less just to see what
was the best case, the back crossing or
[SPEAKER_01]: the F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filial generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of right now, they both seem pretty
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trait was so uniform, the blueberry
trait was so uniform from the jump that...
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gets to the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I was going to walk you guys through a
typical reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you've got two tents,
obviously one tent for your vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: state, one massive tent for your
reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I like to do a one to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you have six plants and you
want to have one reversal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still would go with like three just to
be safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it is a one to six,
I would still do three to six just to be
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is to keep your reversal plants
extremely healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want them going through any
trouble, any pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to burn up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want any of that shit when
you're doing this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice and easier if you had a
third tent where you could start these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants flowering before you start your
main flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like again, two and a half,
two and a half weeks, introduce one,
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks, introduce one, one and a half
week, introduce one, then bring them into
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole tent that you've already started
reversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start spraying the first second that
you put them into flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you'll slowly watch some grow balls
about day 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes about 21 days, 21 to 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually say 21 to 24 days to start even
seeing balls, knowing that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people don't have the patience
and they're like, I've been waiting two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks and I don't see shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wait 20, 21 to 24 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always works.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what doesn't always work is that
it'll drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropping pollen is more of a iffy kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's really it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just let them flower, hope that some
of them drop pollen and when they do,
[SPEAKER_01]: luck and smack this shit out of it with a
fucking stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it around the plants, bring the
plants in that are the receivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you get all their stigma rubbed
up in it, pistols, whatever you call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubbed up in it, try to cover everything
and see if it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reversing isn't that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lot of loss, a lot of failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's kind of a short episode,
but it's something I wanted to go over
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't think I had a beginning A
to Z on how to do this properly,
[SPEAKER_01]: a nice concise, fast A to Z on how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully some of you find interest in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we have our spray up for sale right
now on riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long it's going to be for
sale, but it'll be up for sale for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, hopefully next week we should
have an excellent episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to work with Angus from
the Real Seed Code to talk about land
[SPEAKER_01]: races.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite people on earth to talk
to you about land races and heirloom lines
[SPEAKER_01]: and what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a very thoughtful individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you can't just go learn genetics
and then assume that you can learn
[SPEAKER_01]: everything there is to know about
heirlooms and land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not how it works unless you're a
completely awesomely autistic human that
[SPEAKER_01]: can memorize everything, but it's not for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to refer to other sources when
it comes to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's a high demand for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I guess with that said,
go check out career pie seeds Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: go check out, um, um, um, um, um,
lifted seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we added some more packs, uh,
arcaded, I'm sorry, blue dream arcaded
[SPEAKER_01]: train wreck on the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, high and lonesome always has new stuff
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have the blueberry in cross on sale
right now, and it should be going off sale
[SPEAKER_01]: in about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the spray is up for sale right now as
cheap as it's going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cheaper than all of our
competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go learn how to do this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, stop relying on clone onlys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never forget a clone only or an elite
clone only is one person selection from
[SPEAKER_01]: probably two to three fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit chasing clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get it, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems kind of fucky, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, also, if any of you see the Santa Cruz
screaming hand that was right here,
[SPEAKER_01]: pop up in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been stolen, had a bunch of shit
stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: My spray can guy was stolen over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was a bunch of shit stolen the
other day by some uppity bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, if any of you guys come across
that, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to have it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, some people are just fucking
thieves and that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that was a fast one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds Europe, right.

um, here by seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also have a bunch of the blue and
cross stuff soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already on its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, this was just a short one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to skip a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm going away for a week ish,
but I'm bringing my laptop so I can edit
[SPEAKER_01]: if I need to, uh, for the real see Co
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether it's a live feed or
something for next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, apologize that it was so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.

of you and I'll be seeing you soon.
