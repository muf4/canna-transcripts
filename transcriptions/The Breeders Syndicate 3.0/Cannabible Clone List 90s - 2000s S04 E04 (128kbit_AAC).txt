[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Howdy, howdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got started a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Cathy?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be recording for the
podcast today, so I'm going to try to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it, I don't know, more professional,
since that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I hope you guys have noticed the
audio podcast is going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we have stuff that wasn't out before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing all the editing, so go easy on
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning as I go.
[SPEAKER_02]: New intro, new everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully, hopefully, you guys are
enjoying the audio version now that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where my little fidget thing
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't it letting me view the request?
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How goes it?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today, when we actually start,
I'm going to try to have a nice division
[SPEAKER_02]: so I know where to when editing the audio
that to clip it in, you know, so I try to
[SPEAKER_02]: start with a beginning and end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, my dogs aren't too loud as they
eat their dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I'll wait until that's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm recording for stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Darby likes to eat very loudly.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's been going on with you other
than what we have to talk about tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: What you got going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's hotter than fuck up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, currently, I'm sure it's worse where
you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you live in like literal
purgatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is just partial purgatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I went and saw an old buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out and chatted for hours about
various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I got back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for thanks, Matt,
for holding on the fort while I was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went on a mission, which we'll hear a
little bit more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some point in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you'll be able to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can say it in a general sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went on a mission looking for
pockets of old things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some pockets of old things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and that's it's kind of
interesting, too, because it's like one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the one of the things about about weed
that I find really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about this as part of like
the clone thing tonight is that how like
[SPEAKER_00]: brokers and the demand from the public
dramatically changes what people grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in California or Oregon or Washington
or these places that are like really sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of like in tune or can't sort of came
about with medical or legal earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a lot more rapid change in in
what people grew because of what people
[SPEAKER_00]: demanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some cases now, you know,
you have to go and look for some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to call them backward states
because that's rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, yeah, states that were slower to
adopt, you know, some of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which meant that people could grow things
that were a lot older and they still
[SPEAKER_00]: worked really well for the crew that they
were giving them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a lot of competition
with the new new as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't there wasn't pressure to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, you know, that it kind of ties
into what we're talking about tonight
[SPEAKER_00]: because pressure to change and a desire to
make your life easy and give the broker
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want is what kind of makes old
cuts disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're seeing today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've talked about the last few
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you would have told me 10 years
ago that real sour diesel could be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to acquire, depending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually shocked that lately today
people keep telling me that the forum cut
[SPEAKER_02]: of cookies is becoming art to source,
which blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one of those things where,
you know, I've mentioned this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but every five or 10 years, weed reinvents
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Matt and I, Matt and I looked at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend up here who got a freezer
of somebody who I know everyone talks
[SPEAKER_00]: about freezer beans or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my friend got a freezer of old beans
from people that was someone that was
[SPEAKER_00]: retiring and kind of getting out of the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of being like from the ancient
80s or SS C or shit that people claim,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was almost all from 2008 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pretty cool era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached in, I reached out to Matt
because I was busy having kids and doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of sit then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of like really your
prime time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were like really, really in tune
with what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was surprising to Matt and
I looking over it, just how ancient a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things were and how 99% of it was
unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even especially the Rascal stuff,
like at the time was really hot,
[SPEAKER_02]: selling really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of FM stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was our main competition at the time,
as it were, for FM stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at it, I'm not, a lot of that
stuff's hard to grab now and it's great
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only from, you know,
14, 12, 14 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which doesn't seem that long to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not actually that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, traumas are very
current.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always feels current.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's interesting is like you
get back to 10, 12 years ago and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost impossible to find a lot of seed
stock from then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go back 10 more years and
it's harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go back to the 90s and oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go back to the 80s and it's almost
legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which isn't really all that
long, but the way prohibition works and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the market works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's people, there might
be people in various states that are slow
[SPEAKER_00]: to adapt that have been rocking the same
thing for 20, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's worked for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little customer base that they
have that they, you know, that they give
[SPEAKER_00]: their access to is super stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, so you almost need those pockets,
you know, because like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we talked about the purple episode,
every big grower I knew ran some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: GDP, Urkel, Mendo P, you know,
great, something hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fast forward 10 years and like
six people held onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of hundreds, just in my little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and yeah, there's someone that's
talking right now about, oh, I'm sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the purple craze was like,
I would say it was like 03, 04,
[SPEAKER_00]: 05, maybe a little bit of 06.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it went away for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went away for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 18 years or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now all of a sudden it's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are just as annoyed now as they
were back then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, although back then I would say
one of the biggest things about the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: craze that I don't like was it was really
the first time where a lot of diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: got lost because people just wanted what
the brokers wanted to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were growing all these
different things and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all of a sudden people are like,
well, I want purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of beautiful, beautiful green,
lovely strains went by the wayside for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to, we're going to talk
about like old clones a lot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really one of the eras that
kind of ushered in like the everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to grow the most popular thing at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because pre purple craze of like,
you know, early 2000s, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that worked for the small and
the medium market was pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was good weed, it probably sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike today where you do see a lot of
really good weed go by the wayside for
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that maybe we would all agree isn't
as what we would consider kind as somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, somebody just said, oh, six is when I
first went to reggae on the river and the
[SPEAKER_00]: custody kids had got purple, got purple
shirts on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to, I went to reggae on the river
from, I don't know, probably like 93.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five to Oh three or Oh four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Oh three was like their,
their 20 year anniversary maybe or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, after going for 10 years,
I'd seen most of the acts I wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had gotten kind of a little hectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I kind of felt like it was more like
have a bunch of city kids show up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: river and hope nobody dies kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine reggae on the river in
Bakersfield, how that would go with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's no river.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a river here, but we didn't have,
we had the Kern River here, which is big,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, what we had was called reggae fest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just, I started playing those
shows in about Oh six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we had the reggae band going on at
the time, but it was very different than
[SPEAKER_02]: like the steel drum type reggae that a lot
of people had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just phenomenal to see what
Bakersfield offers in terms of reggae
[SPEAKER_02]: fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got to go to reggae on the river
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a tangent, but I will
talk about it just a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: because when I was coming out here in the
mid nineties as a Midwestern kid,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, reggae on the river has like two
extremely clear memories where I really
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that like the Emerald triangle in
California was a different place than
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was, there was dready kids
walking around reggae in 95, 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, back then it was still a two day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still a two day weekend festival
and it was a lot more locals that hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: had like as many like city kids and stuff
coming up from the Bay yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people were walking around with,
with five gallon buckets with spears in
[SPEAKER_00]: them and you could buy a spear,
like a spear of weed, a top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Oh, I thought you meant spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, not like that kind of
spear, but I mean like for me is like
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who comes from like a world where
it all had to be hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walking up and down the lot with a bunch
of stems sticking out of a top and pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: out an 18 inch top to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like where, where reggae used to be,
it's like, um, or the river is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: like look up and like the 101,
the highway 101 is way up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I was like sitting in a,
in a seat on the river bed and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling bongs and I looked up and there
was a highway patrol looking right at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so coming from the Midwest,
like if you make eye contact with a cop
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're doing drugs, like it's not a
good scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he waved to me and then just went back
to what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like literally ready to like
throw the bong in the river and run into
[SPEAKER_00]: the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was like my training,
like what I, you know, like you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was time to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would just, he just gave me a wave
and went back to what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are, but those were like two
seminal moments at reggae on the river
[SPEAKER_00]: that for most people might not be that big
of a deal, but it just showed like what,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how different, how like there was a
bubble that we lived in, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went through and, and tonight we're
going to be, might be joined by someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure we talked about it,
but as donors will do, we just decided
[SPEAKER_02]: that we'll see if he shows up,
you know, cause you know, plans are plans
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's, that's rough even for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see if this person shows up,
but I went through the can of Bible three,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I remembered that there is a great
list in here of the, the late nineties,
[SPEAKER_02]: early two thousands clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it would be fun to go
through this list together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and there's some that I added in,
there's some that I took out of their list
[SPEAKER_02]: because they really weren't that relevant
in terms of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just happened to be things that he
was aware of that he threw in the middle,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we got it all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brand even made it pretty with a fish
and yeah, whenever you want to start going
[SPEAKER_02]: through it, we can start going through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason, someone just asked Jason is not the
guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no one's talked to him, but you know,
who knows, you know, I used to be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good friends with them a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would definitely be a character to have
on one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very interesting to have on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's super opinionated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, maybe he's mellowed in the last
bit, but uh, you know, highly opinionated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, he was super opinionated in
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some people that drove them absolutely
nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked him and I liked like his
vibe and what he was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard because like when you're,
when you're so certain about something and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't leave room for other people's
opinions, you can secretly offend a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, which Matt knows nothing about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very open.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not, he's not, he's not into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, but yeah, you know,
they, so just as a general sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, before we, before we, you know,
dive into the list a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I will say that, you know,
like I was mentioning earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, when there wasn't much weed,
uh, most weeds sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was better than Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of like the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it was better than green,
or brown Mexican, it's sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the thing matured and,
and like, and, and, and fads and waves
[SPEAKER_00]: started happening, certain popular cuts
started getting, you know, more in demand
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was this period, I would say
from the mid nineties to the mid two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands that may have been the greatest
diversity era we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where most of these cuts that
Matt and I are going to talk about come
[SPEAKER_00]: from, because they came at a time when
there was a lot of seed banks starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate, uh, in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of genetics starting
to get traded around friends and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, almost all good weed had a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hadn't really, it hadn't really
been like, Oh, you, you don't have sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hadn't happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant a lot of people could grow
what they liked, pick what they liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And form a little vibe on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would honestly say that's probably
all that stuff that we're about to chat
[SPEAKER_00]: about is probably the backbone of today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would also, uh, put this in
the era before OG Kush was readily
[SPEAKER_02]: available in seed for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I noticed the big change in
whole collectives being just OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want OG, OG or fucking nothing,
you know, um, right before that was
[SPEAKER_02]: readily available.
[SPEAKER_02]: For everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I remember, uh, walking into a
club in, in the, in, uh, LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing literally no exaggeration,
like 25 different types of Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, and you're like,
well, like that's all your, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, the reason why there's
financial reasons that happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there's, there was, you know,
there's various economic indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That push all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when I first started coming
out to, uh, to Mendo, it was very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very common to buy mixed Finos pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were, they, they would blend the
different plants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have to be like, I have a 50
pack of just this one cut that had started
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, but then eventually it became,
it had to be this one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time that's happened,
even though the purples, I love the Urkel
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Mendo P and stuff like that are
pretty close to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and most of the sour diesels that
people argue about right now, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: they're real or not, or most of them are
good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush's are excellent smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm not as big a fan of cookies,
but, uh, you know, um, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they just came at a cost of
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big cost, a big cost of everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the list in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you want to keep it in
some kind of entertaining format.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will just start naming and then,
um, let me know if you have any memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just said the AOTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'm not familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: AOTA is A O T A and it was all of the
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we used to rock the AOTA in the early
two thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AOTA was really tasty weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever mentioned that, uh,
super cool that you popped that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's something I didn't even
know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, uh, I don't think I've seen
the AOTA since probably, oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when the last time I saw the,
oh, the, the AOTA, but we had it in our
[SPEAKER_00]: crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember where it came from,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was, uh, it was, it was,
it was good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was fruity and, uh,
it was, it was really tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I keep remembering little ones to add
in as I'm going through this, but I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: start at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: AF GUI, which predictably was going to be
one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any experience with the AF
GUI?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, a lot of people liked the AF
GUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of thought it was blandish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably smoked that nasty ass outdoor
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk about it then, cause I don't
have the greatest memories of the AF GUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, it, it was spelled so many different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would spell it like AF GUI,
AF GUI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people think that GUI is AF GUI,
uh, which goes from GUI breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have enough experience with GUI
breeder's GUI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the AF GUI I was familiar with was a
more, I wouldn't say short, but yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was, it was more squatter than most,
uh, uh, plants people are used to dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had this beautiful, almost watermelon
blueberry type turp that was very hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: describe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was true breeding for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, almost everything I crossed it to,
or that it was crossed in, took on the AF
[SPEAKER_02]: GUI smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could see how good it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: How people could get very overwhelmed by
it because it's very distinctive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you could also describe as like
cantaloupe berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was unique and I tended to love
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would pass on beautiful resin traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it had good potency, not the best
yield, but, um, I think overall,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it's one of my faves off this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to diss it slightly cause I,
I just saw a bunch of, of low,
[SPEAKER_00]: of midsy before we called things mids,
uh, midsy outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would think it could be very midsy
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not, it was not, I never saw the
greatest examples, but then there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how about, I have no experience with
real Albert Walker, but I did get the Dago
[SPEAKER_02]: fake Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you grown Albert Walker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I grew the real Albert,
Albert Walker, but I do think that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty flavorful and potent cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Fletch has a lot of familiarity
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fletch would be an excellent person to
chat about the history of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that like none of my,
none of my old crew, uh, or really had any
[SPEAKER_00]: access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was one friend of mine that
might've been growing it for a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't, it wasn't too much.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now this is one that a lot of people
are familiar with from, um, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck Dutch flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know there was two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am familiar with that, that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this guy my God, does he go by a
crunch bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was a guy on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably search for them or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the blue dot was one of the big
strains that used to get pushed through
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in Oakland a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pushed through one of the
early, uh, dispensaries that we called the
[SPEAKER_00]: third floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third floor, third floor, which was a
pretty famous dispensary back then in the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of people got their purple cuts
from the third floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very tied into my area to
Humboldt and, and, and Mendo and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a hold of like the granddaddy and
the Urkel and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, crunch bubble from IC mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to blow up tons of blue dot back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was a nice cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never ran it personally, but there,
it was like, it was one of those like Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: area specials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it really got rocked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think it was part of blow fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy used to send it, you know,
you know, you have like 40 lighters or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and early warehouses with like,
do you remember like all the old,
[SPEAKER_00]: like skinny rectangle sunlight hoods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with like the, with the single
ended 600 watt Hortilux.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like the trays and all that,
like that was like cutting edge at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, he had, he had some,
you know, pretty good size scenes or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that, and, and there was like a
huge demand for blue dot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I don't have a bunch of personal
experience growing it, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get bags of it on occasion going
to the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it was definitely like,
it was a Bay area classic for a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, someone just said, I do think that
green crack is a Fino of skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, at least it's, it's heavily
in there and put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the mango, that loud mango turf,
I usually associate with skunk one type
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff as it is, um, blue motherfucking
dream, blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blue dream is one of those things that
has a bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, mostly because, uh, anything that
could get eight to 10 pounds, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, five, let's say five to 10
pounds, be a little bit more generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that could get five to 10 pounds
outdoor reliably, um, got blown up in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you, to me, if you grow blue
dream in like a little pot and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: like a four to eight or 10 ounce plant or
something, it's really flavy and really
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people's opinion of blue dream is
this giant outdoor sort of B grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe poorly dried, um, you know,
rock hard buds, the turps aren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, it kind of got famous
because, um, you know, people used to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with blue dream billionaire, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where back when weed was worth a lot,
you could put out a 99 blue dreams and get
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sweet shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the, it's, it's, there's this
run with blue dream, green crack,
[SPEAKER_00]: even my Maui a little bit where,
um, it's really big yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most people smoke the big
yielding stuff and don't smoke like the
[SPEAKER_00]: little more carefully grown nicer
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their memory of it is, uh, is just the
big blown out crazy nugs that are B grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another thing that I remember with blue
dream during that era was that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, when it first popped off,
we're growing one cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one blue dream cut that was
going around and it was pretty,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty well, um, passed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people, a lot of people had this cut
was being blown out of collectives and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty damn, I mean, good for the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very resinous, had good potency,
good yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, didn't mold up too easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of, none of the stuff that,
you know, we'd normally keep stuff down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that big, huge first push seed
lines were released named blue dream by
[SPEAKER_02]: emerald triangle seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think HSO put out a blue dream and those
quickly, quickly were picked up and run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those cuts were passed as blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the original cut was quickly drowned
out by, um, other blueberry haze type
[SPEAKER_00]: combos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that that thing that Matt
just described is actually a common thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that can happen to certain strains where a
strain gets named something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then it gets made named and put into a
seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's all these phenos floating
around that aren't the original cut that
[SPEAKER_00]: made it famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so there was a bunch of
different blue dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposedly blueberry, but by some
kind of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was a super, so the original cut
was super, super silver haze crusty DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, you know, they, uh,
but you know, like I said, if you grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you grew like a little six or seven
ounce plant of that thing and your light
[SPEAKER_00]: depth or your greenhouse or your indoor,
it was really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, our buddy pack works with it
currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the blue dream train wreck hybrid
for all of us older heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like phenomenal and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was just going to say that,
you know, uh, the first time I really
[SPEAKER_00]: showed my face on any of these things was
when our buddy, uh, CSI asked me to do an
[SPEAKER_00]: event that he was throwing up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and I was on a panel with him
and, um, uh, you know, me and Jean and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, Kevin Jodhury and just different
folks, you know, um, and he talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, train wreck for Northern
Humboldt was one of like the first name
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, you know, the wreck, the wreck,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of legends with the
wreck because it was, uh, it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was, I don't know if,
I don't know if Santa Cruz original Hayes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a whole different movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, blue dream is super silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes is a much, much, uh, uh,
changed child of Hayes.
I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what select genetics to is
referring to is again, there were several
[SPEAKER_02]: different seed lines, uh, unknown
undisclosed Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most people would agree that that blue
dream blue hen from, um, what are they
[SPEAKER_02]: called Kentucky?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I can't remember off the top of my
head, but blue hen was the super silver
[SPEAKER_02]: Hayes 98 blueberry, probably where it was
selected from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it was also widely grown other
than that under the name blue hen as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the very first Santa Cruz cut of blue
dream, which still exists is a super
[SPEAKER_02]: silver Hayes cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one we're referring to
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody likes the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, and if you grow it too big,
it definitely is shitty, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's true of a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sweet spot of yield and quality.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluegrass seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Cameron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluegrass seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's definitely a sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all the same sweet spot with
strains, but there's definitely a point of
[SPEAKER_00]: diminishing returns as you get bigger and
bigger plants where it just doesn't give
[SPEAKER_00]: you as nice of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next would be bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I did, I had a lot of experience
with a lot of other bubble gums in the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed line, but this, this specific clone I
didn't get until a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find it phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an amazing breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This specific cut that CSI and PIP and all
those guys use came by a 1995 from the
[SPEAKER_02]: cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was bought the same year that
it won the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, that's, that's what goes around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a serious, it's a selection from
serious seeds, bubble gum for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it's up there with like,
I wouldn't say it's up there with the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best, but it's got, it's got a good
little punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the disappointing thing about it to me
is that it smells very strongly of bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: gum turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the flavor does not translate for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you don't get any, it doesn't,
it smells like you're smelling big league
[SPEAKER_00]: chew, but it doesn't smell like you're
chewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like you're chewing big
league chew when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most mold resistant things
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a cool plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Arrowhead hemp farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana is serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a serious seed selection though.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people put the Indiana bubble gum
as the mother of serious seeds that they
[SPEAKER_02]: use, but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a selection from their
seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to go even back further,
there's, you know, Adam Dunn has this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing about where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, Neville felt like they just
stole it from working with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And renamed it that it was, it was some
big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some combination of stuff that he
was already working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, um, so there's, there's
dispute over where, where, where it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens a lot where people try to
obscure origins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a common thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Bull Rider in the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wants to hear Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to break it to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was before my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was before my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I got to San Diego,
Bull Rider was RIP fucking nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing you could find was Afghani
Bull Rider, which there is no proof
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence anyway, the Afghani Bull Riders
related to the original Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, Betsy is said to be a sister to
the original Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have, uh, old Betsy still exists
and is still held and run by multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's supposed to be a sister of
the original Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know anyone that has original Bull Rider
that we believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that we're sure of, but old Betsy
exists and who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could exist outside of our,
our, our experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely could exist, but I haven't
seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people made a lot of claims about
it recently, but none hold up and most are
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the Afghan Bull Rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should say something just real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time when I was in Chicago,
uh, before I moved to California,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some bubble gum, um, that they had
bought from out there, uh, and brought
[SPEAKER_00]: back and it had a hot pink hairs and was
lime green, um, and was super gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I never really saw it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only saw it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows who was growing it back then,
but I did see a very cool version of it a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time ago, uh, when Sirius first
released it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, that we went through Bull
Rider, bubble gum, banana OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any, I know you've grown
banana OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any, uh, memorable experiences
with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do actually think that, you know,
a lot of these things, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: dessert and, uh, and fruit names now annoy
the fuck out of me because they have no
[SPEAKER_00]: relation what they're marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no relation to whatever they
name them after, but I do think banana OG
[SPEAKER_00]: does have a little bit of banana turp to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I will say that I will say it's,
it does have, I get a banana sense when I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's an odd OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what to make of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, did Oregon kid or somebody like that
made it famous?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really my background on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So banana OG came from a pack of OG years,
Kush, his original release of what he
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to be the OG Kersi line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no Chiquita bananas, not the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came way later and as a rename.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so he got it as, uh, the OG Kush,
the, the clone that he had, and he got,
[SPEAKER_02]: he selected a male from some, uh,
I think it was an indoor, um, 60 40 from
[SPEAKER_02]: Sager Matha, which meant 60 sativa 40
Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He popped those and I've asked,
um, Tony from Sager Matha what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said it was just something he
bought in bulk from someone he didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just labeled 60 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he knew exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, whatever was in the 60 40
kicked, whatever would be true for these
[SPEAKER_02]: banana turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he released OG years, Kush expecting it
to be a good version of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where people found this
beautiful, beautiful clone that was very
[SPEAKER_02]: banana like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later on, you know, as people pop more
seeds, more people found different clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would call banana OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a one that circulates right now
that most people have is the same one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few more that are more laughy
taffy, like artificial banana type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've smelled one banana hybrid from,
um, uh, Pico our buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it smelled like fucking banana bread,
like just dead on like that banana
[SPEAKER_02]: cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the most amazing banana
smelling things that I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll throw in something that's,
uh, kind of related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, before, uh, there used to be
in the, in the forties, fifties and
[SPEAKER_00]: sixties, um, the banana, the banana that
everyone ate was a different banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that you eat than you eat now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was destroyed by root fungus,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a much different flavor than the
current banana that everybody is grown up
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is kind of how
banana candy tastes a little different
[SPEAKER_00]: than you would expect it to taste like
it's banana, but it like, it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you think of it as like candy,
chemi banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that flavor was, was developed off the
first bananas that were commercially sold
[SPEAKER_00]: in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't change it, you know,
there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cavendish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most banana candy is based on the
flavor of the Cavendish banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the modern banana that everybody is
used to eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I actually owe a great deal
of my career to the banana OG and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon kids stuff and, uh, Tony from
sacred math is stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still lives on today and a lot of
strains that I work with and the others
[SPEAKER_02]: work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So banana OG is the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I like it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say in a lot of out-crosses,
depending on what you cross it to,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are phenos that are just straight
cardboard and they're hard to dodge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that clone stands a test of time,
I think for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of got buried a little bit and it
got lost amongst other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, it's a, it's a cool,
unique Terp and it had a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, here's a fun one that,
that probably is, is actually several
[SPEAKER_02]: different, different clones or seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the Cavendish replaced the,
I was off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking about which banana
cultivars existed and I got it reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Cavendish was the first and the
Cavendish is now and it replaced this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to pronounce it,
but it was like Gross McHale or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, someone keeps asking about the
Chiquita.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Chiquita banana was a pop
from the Platinum Banana OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was a hybrid of Bubba Kush,
something in Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came, I mean, that was so much
later because it was from my work and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was later like seven years after I made
the Platinum Banana OG and my work was so
[SPEAKER_02]: much later after Oregon Kid did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's, they're very different,
but the Chiquita banana is based on if it
[SPEAKER_02]: has a lot more in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, many, many different clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw several in San Diego called
cat piss that were very different from
[SPEAKER_02]: each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some I didn't smell any cat piss in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people did.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll say a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that, you know, I think that it's
one of those aspects of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people relate stuff to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's like, I think it's like a,
I think it's like how some people perceive
[SPEAKER_00]: certain kinds of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since turpentine is kind of a common
aroma that pops up, I think there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe we're going to have a
Shawbud on the, on the program here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could probably save the deep
dive into cat piss for him because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of his specialties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knows an enormous amount about the
history and he's tried all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a San Diego cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Pittsburgh cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was different types.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but, you know, so there was,
there was a few different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm bringing in someone if he wants to see
how he's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is cheetah piss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who fucking knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than having the name piss in it,
you know, that's marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a cookie team coming up with
marketing names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie never really has any names that tie
to what this strain is actually like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely have a team of marketing
people deciding what to call things and
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of art goes with it and what the
packaging is going to look like and what
[SPEAKER_00]: the mylars are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a very new school type of
approach to naming strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good, Gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can text if you have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked if any SSH smells like cat
piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a great example of
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat pissy smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have argued, if you go and read like a
bunch of Neville's old posts on hazes,
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll talk about when you inbreed haze,
all you get is a bunch of cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we inbreed haze, all we get is a
bunch of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as any breeder will tell you,
once turpentine becomes the dominant smell
[SPEAKER_00]: in your strain, boy, is it hard to get
other smells to pop up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is very, very, very dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's different turpentines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are astringent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some are this or that or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a range in turpentine
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, whenever Neville talks about cat
piss, I think of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know there's Afghanis that are
acrid and ammonia type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I used to think of when
people would say pissy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think of the acrid ammonia ureic
type smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of people think of
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, my nose does not pick up that
piss scent from turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you, you know, the other
part of it is like once you, when you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: or you smoke C5 or something like that,
and it's just a turpentine monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he refers to it as very cat pissy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then obviously that's what his mind goes
to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, the cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cheese has a pretty cool story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the oldest skunk one fino
that's spread around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be from the late
eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be popped by sort of like
a bunch of, would you call them punk
[SPEAKER_00]: anarchist squatters?
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposed to be, I don't know much about
the crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were supposed to be ravers
or some electronic shit.
Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, anarchists, you know,
like punks, ravers, underground weirdos
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to unpopular music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But skunk, but it was a fino of skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most skunk one is citrus or floral,
sometimes gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grape, never skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rarest would be probably the kind
of a funky cheese aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a sister of it supposedly
called psychosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not nearly as circulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the English are all big on it
because it's one of the few things that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually originated from their island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blues, livers, psychosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's another one, too, that they
always used to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really would, I'd love to grow them
one day, but I had never been where I
[SPEAKER_02]: could get it from a source with
provenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only gotten it from like seed lines
or, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of those cuts that different
people give different names to,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the bright side cut or the this cut
or the that cut, you know, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically, it's basically a
classic skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I will say about is I
learned a lot from that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: A huge amount from that fucking cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned that it was one of those cuts
that like early on growing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was really foot funky cheese for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I got it later and it was fruity and
sweet, I was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fucking fake cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not what I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of those cuts that really
taught me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are talking about suicide cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like any like a lot of old famous
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll use a different example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my lifetime, I've watched the
chem dog get called chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shortened it to dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy came online and it became the
skunked VA cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got called the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, different cuts that are the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same cut can get different nicknames
and different different things over time
[SPEAKER_00]: with different crews.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Exodus, suicide, bright side,
you know, all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all, you know, there's like there
was like a small little family that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this late 80s English scene,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So and you know, it's it's it's skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breeds really well for calyx,
you know, better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It improves leafiness, makes less
leafiness, makes long running colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mildly potent, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say most most skunks are in like the
mid teens in terms of in terms of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gets big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little metallic, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone mentioned one that we actually I
should have put on the list, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever have any experience with
Blackberry up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Blackberry Kush, but just Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had more with Blackberry Kush,
although I always thought it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberry and people added Kush to it
because at the time all these brokers
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, here's your purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Blackberry was a lot
different from the Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Blackberry Kush was a white rhino
bubba hybrid from Oregon Kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Blackberry was from a dude
named Soma Blaze, if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Soma Blaze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ended up passing away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Naboo ended up kind of carrying on the
torch of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there were a lot of
beautiful pictures, I think, in one of
[SPEAKER_02]: these Canna Bibles, if I can pull it up
super fast, has a beautiful picture of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a real famous picture of it inside
of a jar of Blackberry preserves that was
[SPEAKER_02]: really famous of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, there wasn't a lot of colored
weed, so it stood out very much so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was used a lot in a lot of the
hybrids that were famous from that point
[SPEAKER_02]: on because it bred true for whatever its
purple traits were.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a long time, people thought it was
different from the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think later on, people realized that
there was a good chance it was a bag seed
[SPEAKER_02]: for Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's kind of where we're at
with this today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Naboo had a voodoo doll right now,
he'd be getting stabbed in the jungler
[SPEAKER_00]: vein on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely would.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be really upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does seem like the timeline is
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I'll say about the
Blackberry, whether it was Blackberry or
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberry Kush, both of them were pretty
weak potency-wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella midsy, fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella midsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say midsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was very hard to get high from
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that was the only thing in your jar,
you better have a light potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A light tolerance, I should say,
if you want to get anywhere on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Blackberry Kush, especially,
I had a very hard time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful, too, because it was
super resinous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of those things that I
always put in my head as like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was some beautiful looking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you pick it up, you see all that
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the shit that taught me pretty
fucking frosty weed doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: mean you're going to get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, Blackberry Kush was the kind of
thing that brokers would come up here and
[SPEAKER_00]: freak out on and buy a shit ton of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they wouldn't move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, no, I got way too many
complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too like, people want to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are comparing it to Purple
Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Purple Punch has, I think,
personally, great turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say Blackberry Kush really was
not on the great turp range.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't even call.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no turps then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was even that was even before most of
the revolution of hashish that happened
[SPEAKER_00]: again with all the nails and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it never got the it never really got
the I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was bumped in Mendo for a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, here's your your your favorite chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we started covering some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, I mean, you know,
it was it's one of those things where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been talked about tons by various people
myself, our buddy Skunk VA and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the best thing you could
say about chem dog is that it is it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: rare potency, very rare potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potency tends to be dominant and
translate into lots of hybrids that you
[SPEAKER_00]: make with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes up for being and strangely
enough, it doesn't look very resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of looks to me like ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, it's like some kind of
ancient ugly Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's hideous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in like I see Skunk VA crazy composer,
those two can make that shit look so
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they do it, but most
grows like even my grows of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it is just cannibalizing its own
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that that actually sour does the
same thing as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of why I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they there's an aspect to that where a
lot of I'll say this, and this might piss
[SPEAKER_00]: some people off or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of people that are
taking we would always take the the the
[SPEAKER_00]: dog to like, say, 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we kind of somewhere
between 65 and 72 or 73 days, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how long you could let it rock,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it would test somewhere
between, you know, 18 and 22 or 23%,
[SPEAKER_00]: then, but it knocked your head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when all this testing bullshit
came into effect, they realized that that
[SPEAKER_00]: was too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some people started cutting it at
like 53, 54 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see white hairs all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll test at 29%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so the grower gets to grow it
quicker and turn it quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the dispensary is happy because
it gets to put this high THC label on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people end up on the legal
market these days buying premature chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, in my opinion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care what it does to my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be nice if it had flavor to
that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this is what I'll say sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes chem dog has amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really deep flavor that I love and I
can smell it in the weed and that smell
[SPEAKER_00]: translates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I grow chem dog all the time and
maybe one or two rips a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have tried a million different ways
to figure out whether it's heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's new, whether it's this,
whether it's that, I've grown it salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it organic, I've grown it every
which way you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it gives me the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the potency is almost always
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency and the high is pretty
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The closest I've seen of that turf extreme
was from and I always talk about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like I didn't get the love for chem 91
or the dog as you guys called it until I
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked a chem 91 hybrid that he had made
that was very chem 91 dominant in the
[SPEAKER_02]: turf, but it was just turned to a 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine it's probably how chem 91 was
when you guys first started growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understood the love for it after
that, because that turf profile is fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: nice and it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smelled anything close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hard to coax out and it does do
this thing where you can grow it perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: organic or chem whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the times it'll get this leaf
rust and it'll start cannibalizing its
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and it'll start dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start looking like shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud itself usually stays perfectly
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of those endless white pistols
on it too, just like no matter what people
[SPEAKER_02]: do, it just will keep throwing white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll throw out something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you used to grow it under like
Hortalux or your standard whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would take 80, it would take 70,
like I said, 68, 72 days, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a bunch of my favorite head stash
under pure ceramic metal halides,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a blend of the 31 and the 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dog shit got done two weeks
earlier and I pulled the chem 91 at 87
[SPEAKER_00]: days and it still had white hairs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all over it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did this weird thing where the
spectrum made this sativa finish two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then made the dog go two and a half
weeks longer than I've ever seen it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: still wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who the fuck knows why that is,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I've been growing it since
1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually have one or two at least
going for head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've grown it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, your second favorite,
maybe chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D is cool, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D has a different high than chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's prettier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frostier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much prettier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: People call it, you know, I don't know
what you call it, roadkill or dead bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: or some kind of like decrepit funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always refer to it as like bad breath to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's weird about it is that I can
crack a jar six feet away from someone and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be like, who's got the skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also smelled baby shit come out of
it, like pure putrid baby shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has a lot of expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you get close to it and you can't
smell that skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just smell the putrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a hybrid, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might get me in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's a hybrid of chem 91 and
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the super skunk gives it its
frost and its color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It even herms kind of like the super skunk
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, the chem 91 throws that
crazy potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a short squat Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also say that there's three or
four fakes that float around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those fakes tended to get trade baited
a lot more than the original cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt was talking about how certain cuts
got buried by the wave of what came after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots and lots of people have fake Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wanted D, but not everybody had
access to D.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was always a bunch of people
willing to pass around fake versions of it
[SPEAKER_00]: just so they could use that cut to unlock
a bunch of other cuts they wanted to get
[SPEAKER_00]: access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just so happened that they got some
fakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like some pretty reputable people
that are supposed to know a bunch got
[SPEAKER_00]: fakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be really hard to tell in the
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side by side grows usually show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, the real D, it has a potency
and a flavor the other ones don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just said, I have no idea if the
GMO was made with the real chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, GMO was made in Spain,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very doubtful that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great GMO is a great cut on its
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of irrelevant in the
sense that it works good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It washes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a good cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always like when I categorize it in
my head, I always refer to like the Chem
[SPEAKER_02]: D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it as the more cushy looking
one by its nature, how it stacks and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Chem 2, I always remember as the
most cushy of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more like little tiny nugs looking
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm being real, I think there's there's
Chem 91 in both Sour Diesel and in Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chem D is sort of like a squat Afghan
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sours are sort of like a tall lanky
Colombian skunk type version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my view.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem Dog number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem Dog number four is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the most widely circulated
chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see a lot of fake cuts ever pop
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really fake cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reminds me a lot of NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Pip, who we joke loves to take
everything 12 weeks, no matter how long
[SPEAKER_00]: it's supposed to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had him take a really nice nug of Chem 4
and put it on top of a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's 1989 NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like it really is a dead ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I smoke enough Chem D or Chem 4,
I get like a raciness in my chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has long running buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'll say about it is that
it takes probably 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people cut it at 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people were cutting it at
8 to 9, like in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a there's a lot of Chem D that
doesn't make the cut because most people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to take it that full 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue dream of gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you if you take if you take the
Chem 4 84 days or something like that and
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow it nice, it's it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say no Chem 4 is probably one
of the furthest from the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks nothing like the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Chem 1 is probably the furthest
from the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Chem 4 definitely is very far from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to do the ChemSys or S1
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do we can do the ChemSys real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ChemSys is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists in a couple of S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is called the Bundy Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them got traded as Chem D all over
the place, mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy that I always call Staten Island
confirmed that Greg had both the Sys and
[SPEAKER_00]: the dog in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he chose not to bring the Sys West
because he didn't like the high and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's good history on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Cherry Slider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any experience with Cherry
Slider?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have no history.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came from a dude named Skitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was from the early boards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked what is the ChemSys
Skunk VA uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he uses the Bundy Cut,
which is a ChemSys S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Greg about the ChemSys because
since it never came West with my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really had a bunch of access to it
or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me as far as he knew the
original was dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was only some bag seeds that
existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be that as it may.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever fuck with Chocolate Trip?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that was a Dutch Flowers Cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I grew is the one a lot of people
grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it was like a C99,
probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no one's ever said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I've never talked to anybody about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'm just fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say about Dutch Flowers is
that I've always I've always I've said a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch on this show that I thought that
weed wasn't ready for modern day marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're a bunch of like half
autistic weirdos that hide out with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Dutch Flowers in the forum
days, they wrote beautiful ad copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you would read their metal haze or
their chocolate trip or their this or that
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd read it and they would get
people so hyped for their drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just paragraph upon paragraph of gorgeous
writing about what the weed was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would get so fucking excited
about every single Dutch Flowers drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, yeah, they they they did
well with let's get a professional ad guy
[SPEAKER_00]: in here and evoke some language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they use language very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sure did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I collected their stuff heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even after I found out, like by
growing a bunch of it, that it was really
[SPEAKER_02]: it was either just stuff renamed or just
not very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are asking questions real
quick that are going way too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm apologize if your question doesn't
get picked up because we're trying to chat
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say someone just mentioned pot
of gold pot of gold was a pot of gold and
[SPEAKER_00]: was it was one of my favorite probably my
favorite thing that came from the Flying
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a Hindu Kush by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a very, very flavorful
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had this other thing called the
real McCoy, which was a Hawaiian by Scott
[SPEAKER_00]: and they might be on the list,
but there's a it was a Hawaiian by skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: one that was also super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked both of those a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final good question I thought
was gravity from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think although we're not sure,
it seems like gravity is unreleased
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of Black Domino.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Black Domino was a sensei release.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hash plant by NL one by garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he had a few different versions
that he made before he released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think gravity is one of the two
unreleased versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, metal haze is one of the Dutch
flowers ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was basically a skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was definitely one of the ones that
they got people drooling over releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a bunch of that one as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are going in motherfucking
alphabetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever you got damn pendejos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever grow a cotton candy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did grow a cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually recently grew a cotton
candy as one through my my my buddy who
[SPEAKER_00]: lives near me that I've traded back and
forth with for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about the lineage or
the backstory of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Federation seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cotton candy was the one that I was
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like most stuff from Federation,
there's a lot of accusations of name
[SPEAKER_02]: renaming whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure what it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've always been a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it will make a comeback one
day just because of its name and its
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a good modern look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just threw in a sensei star
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke from Paradise Seeds is sensei star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei star is an amazing line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He refuses to talk any lineage or history
that I'm aware of about specifics of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensei star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, myself, our buddy Pip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have been hunting forever for real
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried recently with Luke and and I
highly respect Luke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's one of the most respected actual
breeders over in Amsterdam by other seed
[SPEAKER_02]: makers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a very serious breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it came from a different era where a
lot of people stole his his genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would give out testers.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would release it before he even
released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I would say a lot of the people
like Simon from Serious Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke, others, they didn't see any benefit
in giving out lineage that their
[SPEAKER_00]: competitors would just steal and claim to
have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville was extremely open about what
he used and where he got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every other Dutch person after that
was tight lipped as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say that's probably
accurate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's super accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got they got very tight lipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw no benefit to revealing what it
was made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all their secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want anybody stealing the
genetics and they didn't even want anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: writing similar genetics on their own
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just kept quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't we don't know what sensei star
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what AK is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what Callie Mist is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cough is something that we have a really
good friend of ours on the Discord that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more suited to cough history than
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cough is very likely an NL5 haze
phenom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of Connecticut in the early
90s and it made its way to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people refer to it as the Fort
Collins cough, but it did start on the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's an NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the buzz like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those, you know, it's one of
the surviving NL5 haze phenoms in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was cough one and cough two,
which were hybrids of that, which have
[SPEAKER_00]: their own sort of story behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll have him on one day to
promote.
[SPEAKER_00]: He breeds and does cool shit and he's a
good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good friend of ours and he knows a
lot of the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just did an interview with Dude Grow
Shows, a working man where he gives the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole history that he knows of the cough
that people want to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just recently uploaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a trustworthy character and he's had
it for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows most of the people involved that
brought it to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, I've said this before too,
but NL5 haze probably has the most
[SPEAKER_00]: surviving cuts around of any 90s cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between Europe and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes 12, 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabney Blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Dabney Blue ever run up in your area?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was big in San Diego and it was big in
SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My knowledge might even be negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was an awesome cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a blueberry muffin type turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more potent than most of the
blueberries that were around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's about all there is on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen it in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's asking about Big Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I guess we didn't cover Big Sur
Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do Big Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Sur Holyweed has a lot of legends
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposedly grown by monks in
Central California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that my buddy who gave me both
the Super Skunk and the Chem, it was his
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite weed that he could get on Dead
Tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And supposedly there was Big Sur Holy
Skunk and Big Sur Holy Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both were sold on Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he swears that Big Sur Holyweed had
such a unique smell that you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody walk by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the Fanny Pack era.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have somebody walk by and not
only could you tell that they had good
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, you could tell that they had the Big
Sur Holy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some guys, obviously,
that brought some seeds and some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that have some legend to it that brought
it to maybe Adam Dunn or somebody like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And supposedly they mixed it into sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Dunn didn't make sage, so he wouldn't
have been the one to got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can never pronounce this, but it
supposedly descended maybe from purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the Zihuatanejo Purple, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also refer to it as Zacatecas
Purple because Zacatecas is a Z and easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to pronounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was the Zihuatanejo Purple
that's supposed to be in Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Hooked on Phonics truck never
stopped by my house, so I just let Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: take that one because I was going to
mangle it bad if I tried to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a bunch of rumors about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a legendary strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my oldest friends, it was his
favorite weed on Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sold on Dead Tour, two
different types.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what's been proven about it,
what hasn't been proven about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that that's supposedly one of the
key ingredients in Sensei Star.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was from a direct quote from Adam
Dunn, but take it for what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking a bunch of questions and
stuff like that, and we're trying to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get to them all,
which I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're trying to do this in
alphabetical order or some kind of order.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys are asking for shit down in
the S's, it'll be a while because this is
[SPEAKER_02]: looking like it'll be a few parter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the W's, so you're fucked right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm determined to keep this in some
kind of fucking order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Day Wrecker Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that one has a lot of legend to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think because it has a lot of legend
and not a lot of information, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of claims made about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people refer to the Day Wrecker
as the first real headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the original crew that had the
first headband never called it that at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Diesel is one of the most famous
American families.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of nicknames that get
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never ran anything that I thought was
Day Wrecker Diesel that had any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: verifiable story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've done a deep dive and it's
actually on the Breeders Syndicate
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's up there and you can watch
it up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently made it available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a deep dive on trying to research
provenance based on internet research on
[SPEAKER_02]: the Day Wrecker Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got not very far.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't go back very far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the clone's been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard to find things other
than like some tour manager from Grateful
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead kind of gave it out to some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's likely where it begins,
the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does appear to be some kind of Chem
91 hybrid to me, like Chem 91 early OG
[SPEAKER_02]: type hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ripping potent and breeds for that
potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the cut, but I just don't know if
it's the original diesel like it claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next one?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Dogshit Electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, OK, so the Dogshit Electric Boogaloo,
it came out of Minneapolis area,
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota in the very early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be a NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that's 100% guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's conjecture a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, does it really I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made its way to Oregon and got renamed
Dogshit, which is a shame because it was I
[SPEAKER_00]: think Electric Boogaloo is one of the
coolest weed names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 12 or 13 week Sativa, very up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of looks like to me like
classic 90s Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of smells like classic 90s weed to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's one of the pretty if it is pure
NL5 haze, it's one of the prettier ones as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as like visually attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend the hybrids that come
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it or get hybrids of it,
I enjoy it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one that's totally I have no
experience with at all, but you might
[SPEAKER_00]: dumpster dumpster dumpster is supposedly
the story of dumpster is that a guy got
[SPEAKER_00]: busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops in the 90s were throwing all
of his equipment and his weed out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they were upstairs fucking with
it, some people walked by and saw weed
[SPEAKER_00]: plants sticking out of the dumpster and
grabbed one and ran off with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they named a dumpster.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it might be real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not that story is true or
whether it's a tale or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't give you a lot of information
about its Lenny edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, G 13 we did just a few
weeks ago with archive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just uploaded it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went into more detail on it so we can
skip over that one for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The golden fucking goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you talk about the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made by Jeff, Mr. Dank from
Colorado, if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a sister cut, I believe there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember its name, the funky bitch
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a ISS Romulan Island Sweet
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Island Sweet Skunk was a rename of
something else from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Island Sweet Skunk is supposedly an NL5
haspy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know multiple Canadians that have told
me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And supposedly it got renamed by Mark
Emery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wanted skunk seeds to sell in his
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is supposedly an NL5 haspy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was crossed to something
from the one that got sold from Mark Emery
[SPEAKER_00]: was crossed to something that Breeder
Steve had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not popping up in my head right on
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Mr. Dank was from Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I said it got real
popular in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think maybe he moved there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it got super popular in Colorado for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Island Sweet Skunk hybrid of
Steve's Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why he flipped out about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet Skunk Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet Skunk Widow, ISS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, that's what Steve says it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Federation supposedly changed the
name in his story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was I thought Golden Goat was
very frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a nice like narrow leaf dominant
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was it was one of those ones
that got overblown in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people just kind of shit
talked it after a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Granddaddy Purple came about in the
purple craze era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the probably the first
two purple cuts that got famous right then
[SPEAKER_00]: was my Mendo perps and the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right around that same time,
Lavender came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a debate between whether or not
Lavender was massively different than
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel or was just a different little Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy that I was just talking about
that lives over in Lake County,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember 20, 22 years ago, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had brought down the Lavender from
Myers Flat area of Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like looked at it and it was like
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like almost as close to the same
lead as you could imagine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granddaddy Purple was supposedly that
Urkel by by Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have people have tried to push it
on that this gentleman that disappeared
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly a long time ago from Salmon Creek
that maybe it was crossed to the Salmon
[SPEAKER_00]: Creek Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that worked for him and stuff like
that said that they don't believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: because they never saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and why wouldn't they have it if
it came from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that Chris guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Chris, Chris Gacke.
[SPEAKER_00]: He disappeared in 03 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was murdered, but they've never found
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an open case still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so there's there's
different versions of the origin story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that the origin of Granddaddy
Purple, the origin of Urkel are all very
[SPEAKER_00]: mysterious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of people that have tossed
their hat into the ring and said various
[SPEAKER_00]: things about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that, you know,
it's one it's for how popular it became.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one of the ones that you
really can't tie back to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some GDP stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I tend to believe them,
but I'll tell it, you know, and people
[SPEAKER_00]: make their decision on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this woman that I'm friends with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty rare to have a pretty woman
growing up in Leightonville and Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of like furry, weird hippie men
that do it, you know, so someone in their
[SPEAKER_00]: 20s and 30s growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly there was this old Vietnam vet
that brought back some some seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam and grew a bunch of hay and grew a
bunch of sativas and started mixing them
[SPEAKER_00]: with local Afghans and sort of had his
own, which was really common at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: his own his own hill wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was retiring because he'd done
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave he gave her a few hundred
seeds of his hill wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said that she found what got
called the GDP in the first 50 seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, she partnered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped her build it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, she partnered on a 66 lighter
with Ken Estes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say his full name because he's he's
well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gave the cut to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a super anarchist, had no interest in
being public or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ken took it down to the bay and added his
name to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the first people I know of
that added his name to a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, later on, other people started
doing that, taking cuts that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: theirs and throwing their name on it as
part of claiming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's given some mangled versions of
that story I just told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he didn't actually have any part
to do with the origin story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it from my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interview that I post all the time
of Ken telling his origin stories at
[SPEAKER_02]: first, he says it was a a skunk from a
Vietnam vet that quickly turns into a
[SPEAKER_02]: Native American gifted it to him in front
of a some headlights because he was such a
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful white man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he turned it into a seed line that he
helpfully called Ken's GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but my version of it, and I knew
them at the time, was that she gave it to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, and this is back in
the early 2000s or whatever, when everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to stay invisible, especially if
you're running 60, 70 lights and off a
[SPEAKER_00]: generator in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided to go down and flow it into
the bay and flow it into third floor and
[SPEAKER_00]: flow it into various dispensaries and made
a name for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can choose what you want to
believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's here's another one that ties
straight into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: How Cushman's is it was he the inventor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Brett Bogue from Apothecary?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he the inventor of the great?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is who is the creator of great?
[SPEAKER_00]: This might also get me in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I'll say this, OK, and I'll just
let people decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As everyone is well aware, you know,
when things become famous, quickly one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two famous cuts start getting renamed or
hybrids or bag seeds start getting named
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's this there's this,
you know, big push to have your own shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with Cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with the purple crates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at first there was just Mendo perps and
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden there was Mendo
perps, Urkel, Grape Ape, GDP, Platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple, Purple Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: On and on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people think that Grape Ape came
out of Willets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think that Grape Ape was just
a rename.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a gentleman you can find him
on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Dallas and he partnered with
Shiloh and he claims that he flew it down
[SPEAKER_00]: from Canada in cigar cases and brought the
Grape Ape to Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he claims that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Cushman had nothing to do with it
other than Kyle Cushman moved to Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't remember, 0506 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came friends with Dude and got it
from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Kyle had absolutely nothing to do with
it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to give anybody credit,
it's either renamed GDP or Urkel,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag seed of such or homey actually did
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with a lot of these outlaw
stories and stuff, it's kind of who you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember there was also the story that
it was Urkel Shiva Skunk as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just what went around with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, both referred to it as Urkel's
pretty sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: It showed up after the purple craze was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll explain the purple craze for
a minute when I mean the purple craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that there was brokers coming up
from the Bay to Mendo and saying we will
[SPEAKER_00]: buy every gram of this purple weed that
you can get your hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 50 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 80 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 150 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 250 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cash you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens to growers when they
start hearing brokers want to cash you out
[SPEAKER_00]: on however much you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your neighbor is like, dude,
I'm having some trouble moving my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going as fast as I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the neighbor's like, well,
I'll give you this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just give it all to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll move everything you got of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then after a craze
happens, like that, all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: names pop up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it went from one or two
purple strains to eight or 10 of them
[SPEAKER_00]: within a year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably would have lasted longer,
but sort of the Kush, the Kush craze and
[SPEAKER_00]: the sour diesel thing happened and sort of
push the purples to the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green crack, also known as green Kush with
a C.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have a verifiable story
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know people claim various
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know more about it than I do
that you might want to speak on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's some kind of skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it grows like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it's pure skunk or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of I think a lot of like DNA's
lemon skunk and all that shit is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: prettier name.
[SPEAKER_00]: For green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called green Kush when it entered
our circle and I got it through the hogs
[SPEAKER_02]: family circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was originally whenever it was on
the tags, it was always CUSH Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, Cecil did not make green crack or
have anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How Cecil's name entered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me and Cecil went over this
specifically because I was one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: first people to bring green crack into
seed form to the community and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to hunt down the history on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had heard the same thing with Cecil.
[SPEAKER_02]: His crew had a seed line called Kush,
C-U-S-H.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's as far as the connection went.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that they both had renamed Kush's
and they were both spelled C.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's as far as the connection went.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably a skunk one type
because it's super mango with a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would turn mega, mega purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also bred true for that purple trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would show up genetically as
opposed to just with cold in its hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see it come back, but it's one
of those clones that was everywhere and
[SPEAKER_02]: now is nowhere all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say the same thing about Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a four to six or seven ounce
plant of green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a five or eight pound plant in
the outdoor and beat the fuck out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't dry it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you grow a little moderate size plant
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got really nice lemony turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a unique kind of aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a nice uplifting buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think DNA's lemon skunk is just a
renamed green crack that they prettied up
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were known for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when they started their company,
no offense to them or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just went around Mendo and Humboldt
and various places and gathered up as many
[SPEAKER_00]: good clone onlys as they could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they started their company as Soma's
little buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gave them a C99 that they renamed
to some sort of haze, cantaloupe haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they called it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they started their company off of C99
and renamed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start your company that way,
there's no reason to start doing it the
[SPEAKER_02]: right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed business has never been
particularly honorable.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Hobbs breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our San Diego crew is made by Jimbo James
Hogg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said several different things that it
possibly could have been made.
[SPEAKER_02]: His big one was a Williams wonder hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think personally, it was probably a
skunk one, some type of Afghani Williams.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it would fit on lights would fit of
some sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be foot funky cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a lot of the similar thiolic smells
of like a chem D or a cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen sweet hogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has very specific type growth traits on
top, kind of foxtail-y a little bit on
[SPEAKER_02]: top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't allowed out of our circle for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it was, it was out in everyone's
hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think a lot of people are
working with it now and the real ones out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though James is gone,
his family still runs the clothing company
[SPEAKER_02]: and grows and still pushes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's still out there and cool to
be had.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's yours, headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, headband used to be very mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it was very mysterious in
origin, it was supposedly came out of New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and there wasn't a lot of information
about it, which allowed a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: people to be like, this cut is the real
New York City headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result, I have an LA cut I got
as headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a headband that Loompa attached
his name to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a headband that I call the 56 Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that I use a lot,
if people are wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of headbands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of them are good smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then recently, it's come out and some
of the old sour crew has come out and said
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had these cuts, diesel one and
diesel two, which were bag seed of some
[SPEAKER_00]: chem they were getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grew them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a buddy of theirs in New
York that thought that the diesel two made
[SPEAKER_00]: it feel like there was a band around his
head after he smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they nicknamed it the headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it so happens that the diesel two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It so happens that that cut is the seeds
coming out of that cut is where the first
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then 707 headband, the headband that I
have that I call the LA, 707 is a child of
[SPEAKER_00]: that made by Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed that to something that I'm not
sure of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you get things like
people were, you know, there's people that
[SPEAKER_00]: and who knows if that's there's there's
there's people that think that have tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that the one that Matt uses,
what I call the 56 is the original New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people advertise it at that Duke had
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his crew were big on saying it was
the first headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa was big on saying that his headband
was the only real headband and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else was a pale imitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the sour people come out and
start talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that, you know,
the headband they're speaking of that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the first one was not Cush like at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those ones that there was a
lot of stories based on it because there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a bunch of mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a thing about that 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the 56 day just because that's
it's like the least offensive nickname of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that came out of the Cush crew in
Southern California and it came up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay and they renamed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa's story is a bit shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least he got to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided to add his name to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ever since, he's been extremely touchy
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That headband has to be the best headband
and everybody else is just a bitch for
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to have as good of a headband as
Loompa headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a muddled history.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, every time we talk about it,
it stirs up so much shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have no fucking clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the 707 headband, which is a
Mandelbrot seed creation that he used off
[SPEAKER_00]: the mother cut that I still have the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of what I consider to be
O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush type phenos, which is the 56 and the
Loompa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old school guys that first had the
diesel two in the headband, they think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're suspect that it could exist on
the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a lot of things, there's mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one major claim that Duke had
bought it from ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I specifically asked ChemDog about it
and he said he's never grown headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure
that when Duke and Homie tried to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: your buddy Matt and Matt Elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it in that little era when he was
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had no previous experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cut that he uses is a super,
super nice, very potent cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's just a Kush cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the original headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they and, you know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Loompa's headband is a cut that he got
under suspicious circumstances and renamed
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: After himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matteo, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemphill worked with the Elite crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave and himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemphill, Duke, Icy Collective,
probably Skunk V.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cut kind of got pushed around the bay
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got it in 06 maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but yeah, I mean, it's not original
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Duke got it when he worked with
Matt Elite and and Bob Hemphill in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not saying nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get blamed for every time Duke's names
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got Jax Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know shit about Jax Cleaner,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: My main experience with it is via NCGA's
work with Jax Cleaner, I know Subcool,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he used it for Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very cleaner, lemon cleaner type,
you know, scent profile, very strong
[SPEAKER_02]: narrow leaf, super resinous, super fucking
resinous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it bred true for that resin type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see that all through TJ's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, Killer Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know very much about Killer Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it was a big building block in
Subcool's world, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think maybe Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if Killer Queen was in
Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not it's it's one of those you
might have some stories about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any personal, you know,
it's out of that grit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Grimm Brothers Grimm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's Vic High.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vic High.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based on it's based on Grim work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on Grim work.
[SPEAKER_02]: C99 Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that's Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Airborne G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: C99 Romulan, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say Vic High was Vic High was one of
the most well-known early, early forum,
[SPEAKER_00]: early Internet weed personalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he was a super nice cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super smart, super intelligent,
intelligent, smart, really made a name for
[SPEAKER_00]: himself on the early forums and the
Overgrow and and Cannabis World and that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never worked with it, but it was,
you know, he he was very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a real smart cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it got popular off that,
I believe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lone Star, who did the Blue Bonnet that I
work with, also had a killer cut of Killer
[SPEAKER_02]: Queen that would go around Big Yielder,
a very C99 type dominant, but had more
[SPEAKER_02]: fruity turps from all the other shit in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Killer Queen that was later
done with the supposedly the Pacific G13
[SPEAKER_02]: by Motor Rebel that was very different
from the original Killer Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the original Killer Queen was a BC
original and it's still used to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a good one.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon G is you know, some people call it
some people call Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call it Lemon G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a really good buddy, Pip,
who cropped that one for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of it's on that citrus level
where, you know, I view most citrus as
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of to one note for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, but it was a big yielding
kind of ugly, long running colas plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of one of those weeds that
people love for two or three days and then
[SPEAKER_00]: get burned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not I'm not a huge fan of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smell lemon G and everything lemon G
is in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like lemon tree I'm convinced is a lemon G
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's so it's super obvious to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, not the prettiest bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's kind of I would consider it post
cookie era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would consider it ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it burns heavily cropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of extract people love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but yeah, and 39.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can never fucking remember the the code
names that SSC used gunk one and all five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just gunk one and all five.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a skunk one and all five days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, if that's the case, you know,
I will say that, you know, when we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: to Correll, he was extremely honest and
upfront about a lot of various different
[SPEAKER_00]: subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he did get a little cagey when I
asked him about that and the basic five
[SPEAKER_00]: and if he got any seed stock from Neville
and sort of just called it by different
[SPEAKER_00]: names at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He laughed and smiled and didn't say a
whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, so we didn't really get
any specifics from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no indication that he got that
he got, you know, any private NL stock
[SPEAKER_00]: from anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what are you going to say
about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Massachusetts Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, so this one has been described in
other podcasts and stuff quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got an enormous amount of
confusion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attained legendary status,
especially because some of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are involved in it are very famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially since that rank roadkill
skunk seems to be the scam of the minute
[SPEAKER_00]: where for the last five or six years,
people keep claiming that skunk their
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk turps are going to blow you out of
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it because the guy that went and got
it from Virginia crew brought it west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gave it to, you know, when when Jerry
Garcia died and skunk the age started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, he got the cut from my from our
buddy and started growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posted some pictures of it on his page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's in sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not really from
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got dropped off there by my buddy when
he got the chem dog from dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about it is that
the cut when when skunk the went east and
[SPEAKER_00]: got the chem D and brought it back when we
gave when Greg got the dog back.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that point, according to according to
to our buddy, he had already lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the the Massachusetts super skunk that
they posted in the in the high times was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot shorter, was a lot squatter,
was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one I believe is the mom of
diesel because diesel is a spitting image
[SPEAKER_00]: of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to bring that up in the sense
that it's more than likely bag seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's one of those ones where nobody
really wants to claim the truth on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people keep popping up swearing
that they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones where it's like
there's a massive demand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never seen anyone that I grew it
from probably 90, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: late 90s to oh, eight ish or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen a jar of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone that claims that they
have rank skunk and it's going to pop in
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never, you know, and you would think
that it's so popular and people so want
[SPEAKER_00]: those skunk turps that all these various
breeders and stuff that claim that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to you're going to find a bunch of
skunk in their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's one of those legendary
cuts now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most people got rid of it because it
smelled like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and and all that and like
the the Massachusetts super skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say this isn't super well known,
but it is not pure super skunk either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bred through various skunky things
that SSC SSC had and Neville had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when Neville released the super
skunk, they crossed that that line that
[SPEAKER_00]: they already had to the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phenos of that are what became famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's the latest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The information that we got from one of
our members of our crew got directly from
[SPEAKER_02]: the guy who bought or bred the mass super.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect where, you know,
there's like like we were just talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about with the headbands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystery history allows various people to
make wild claims thinking that it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: ever get popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out to California with my friend
when the same time you brought the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it survived amongst our crew and he
grew it for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to Colorado through that that
breeders other friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got called Skunk Six out there
after the the the number of the phen of
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of the phenyl, you know that
they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a lot of legend to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's probably in it's in my
opinion, it's probably in Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably it's deaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's in sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people want it and it seems
to not exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe it exists in various
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it pops up one day, but more people
have been excited about selling the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then making sure they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been excited about selling the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say one other thing that,
you know, Neville always said that his two
[SPEAKER_00]: best selling things were Super Skunk and
and NL five hates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's probably a lot of Super Skunk
out there blended into various things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I personally think that Super
Skunk is a lot of what people refer to as
[SPEAKER_02]: skunky dink that went around in their area
was probably if you know, Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm damn near convinced of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: After seeing stuff like the old P. Ninety
one, my heirloom Afghani line,
[SPEAKER_02]: just an old Afghani line that happened to
be from Florida is very Super Skunk like
[SPEAKER_02]: the clockwork cut all kinds of shit around
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was what I navigated to.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask how the hell could it have
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most skunk, you know, people think about
this crazy turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that it had the turp in
spades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredibly stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only moderate potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only moderate density.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have this big ass bud and you'd
put it on the scale and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that's going to be six or seven grams
and it'd be like two and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was pre carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got a lot of people in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember driving up to my house
a bunch in summer and like parking in my
[SPEAKER_00]: driveway and I could just smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was, you know,
like I said earlier on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: other things get more popular and people
drop shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they think, oh, I can always get
it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else is holding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else is holding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, you know, you can't
find it, you know, so, but it exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of children, I definitely think
it's in sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell it in sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can even see it in sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's from my buddy sub Rob,
the Matanuska Valley Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a cool story about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds to me like the Matanuska
Valley Thunderfuck ends up being kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like Crippie or diesel or something like
that in terms of it was like a name for
[SPEAKER_00]: fireweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was on dead tour, there was a
buddy of ours that was from Alaska and was
[SPEAKER_00]: on tour and he would go home to Alaska in
between tours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him one time I gave him like
$1,200 for a quarter pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he didn't give me any weed for
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought he jacked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he called me up and he said,
Hey, I'm going to send you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me this weed and it showed up
in the mail and it was wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took it out and I dried it and it
was only like three and a half ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lost like a half ounce of weight and
it was three and a half, four months late.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said it was Thunderfuck and it was
olive dark green with these weird hairs
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddies and I kept it in the freezer
and we smoked it only for special
[SPEAKER_00]: occasions over the next six or eight
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great high, great buzz, much better weed
than anything we had at the time as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: kind bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, this is when I was 17,
18, 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and everyone that's claimed Matanuska
Thunderfuck since then, none of it has
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it looked like the weed that I got
back then one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's like everyone's story that
I've met.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people from Alaska that I
think are very convinced that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the Matanuska Thunderfuck that
they had was the original and the only,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they can tell you all about it,
you know, who grew it, who made it,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of stories like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it, I think they're
probably all telling their own truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I will say too, that, uh,
the, the package that I got mailed was
[SPEAKER_00]: mailed from Denali, Alaska post office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, but I thought I got ripped off for
months cause I gave him 1200 bucks and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't see any weed for months and he kept
his, he kept the funny thing about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a side,
side tangent, but he kept, his,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was a native to Alaska and he kept his,
um, license and all that from Alaska
[SPEAKER_00]: because Alaska, native Alaskans got,
um, oil money every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though he was on dead tour and he
was like in the lower 48, most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year, he would keep all of his shit at his
parents' house and just go back there in
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would get like between a two and a
$5,000 check every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that fucking wild?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends, uh, in high school got
shipped out to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were a bunch of punk rock kids and he
got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got in a lot of trouble one day doing
some punk rock things and got shipped out
[SPEAKER_02]: to Alaska for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came back and he was the first
person to like talk to me about some
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that was like, he's like,
bro, hugest THC numbers ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Matanuska Valley
Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and he had this big tail of,
of, uh, you know, this very special potent
[SPEAKER_02]: weed that was out there in Alaska,
you know, and I was always trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out more about this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I, as I kept digging deeper and
deeper, I learned that there were several
[SPEAKER_02]: people with several claims to several
Thunderfucks out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you dig into it, the wider the
story becomes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of bikers involved in most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to say if it was a one thing
or it was just a regional name like Maui
[SPEAKER_00]: Waui, like Crippy, even my buddies,
everyone thinks about diesel as sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel now, but you know, in the mid
nineties or whatever, the only reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: it got called sour diesel was because the
guy wrote our diesel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because diesel was slang for fire weed in
New York city in that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends that lived there said that you
got all kinds of diesels because that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the, that was the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Thunderfuck is a bit like
that, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you, have you ever heard of sour
diesel being called the cock diesel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever heard that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked, I've talked, I've talked
to, to almost everyone at length in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel original family, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I, I never heard cock diesel,
but you know, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why that's in my memory bank,
but yeah, that's one of the names of my
[SPEAKER_02]: memory bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a secret they kept amongst
the boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few of the boys, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few, just a few of the bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're almost two hours in and we are
only like, a portion of the way through
[SPEAKER_02]: this list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll probably be a few episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to announce a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have breeder syndicate 2.0 up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the audio podcast is back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rolling a lot of new things are
rolling with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's available on any podcast software.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you look for the new logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's white and pink right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're developing some other new logos.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of new cool things going on
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the breeder syndicate, Patreon,
where we all hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come hang out with us there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a discord and we're there all the
time taking questions for seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have my seeds and my reversal spray
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so anything you want to plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really big on plugging publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I will say like, as always that
like I, I'm super stoked that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely trying to bring like
culture and history.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mostly what we're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of like podcasts end up
being sort of like infomercials about
[SPEAKER_00]: people, which isn't necessarily bad,
but like there's a lot more diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world, cannabis culture,
you know, historical, um, that isn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: just about making people look good,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are, I always appreciate people
coming out, you know, um, and uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you always can reach,
you can always reach me through DM on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always reach me on, uh,
I answer a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get, I get swamped,
you know, I have a life too and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, we are, we are thinking
about, um, you know, one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: why we talk about some of these old things
is that we think they're going to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps I am thinking about, um,
you know, doing some like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some, you know, I've never been
really a public breeder and I'm,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt has been trying to convince me to
open myself up to lots of criticism and
[SPEAKER_00]: hate and people throwing things at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so people, so, but then there's
a lot of things that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always bred for stuff that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've been thinking about maybe,
you know, doing some, uh, doing or
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing some stuff that might be very
different than what is currently out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't know if people would be
into it or not, but it's, it's always been
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a, you know, a passion thing for
me or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, we'll, uh, um,
how far did we get on the fucking list,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got pretty far in, but there's a lot
that like people are talking about that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been writing down that I want to go
back and touch on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I will say there was a,
there was a shit ton of really good
[SPEAKER_00]: questions this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them I missed because it's,
it's, you might, it's like rubbing your
[SPEAKER_00]: head and patting your stomach at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to like talk
intelligently in a flowing form and then
[SPEAKER_00]: think about, like four or five cool
questions all at the same time that you
[SPEAKER_00]: see scroll by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Matt's been taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to get, we'll try to expand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this show is, you know, as much as
it's about us talking about random weed
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that we do all week anyway,
it's for you guys too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit us up all the time with questions
or, you know, or ideas or thoughts on like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you might want to hear, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I'm not, I'm not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, you know, uh, Caleb, Matt,
other people, they've been trying for
[SPEAKER_00]: years to not only get me to talk,
but to get me to like publicly release
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's kind of a bitch being
a public reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been kind of hesitant to like open
myself up to like a bunch of criticism and
[SPEAKER_00]: assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I might, I don't know,
you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, there's a lot of cool things I
think that get passed over with fads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, uh, we are almost at two
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe we could, we're thinking
about having Sean next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could continue this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we could, you know, two hours is kind
of long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but maybe we'll figure out a format to
do the rest of them fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a part of the Patreon and,
um, the discord, and you want to give us
[SPEAKER_02]: some other ideas for other clones,
you'd like to hear about from that era,
[SPEAKER_02]: just throw it up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, discord is definitely a much
easier way for us to converse back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth, especially individual, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, you don't have to,
but it just, it's, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always reach out to IG,
but sometimes I get buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, we try to keep it at two
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll, we'll keep this going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad everybody liked chatting about
old stuff as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: We super appreciate your Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and everyone have a killer weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
