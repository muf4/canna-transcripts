[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in like oh four oh five I was on
cannabis world And I got the green bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple bubba both from Ken organ kid
and then I had a Shahbud who is 707 seed
[SPEAKER_00]: band His bubba Kush cut they were all
called bubba Ken called the purple Fino,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was supposedly an s1 That some club
owner in the in the valley made Those
[SPEAKER_00]: really heavy yielding made like club type
nuggets with the rounded top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the katsu cut I As far as I know and
I can't remember specifically but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty sure that That was the cut that he
sold to katsu right and that was the green
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino and then Shahbud aka 707 seed bank
his his bubba cut was The pre-98 and so
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what happened is I had all three
cuts I need to label them in my room so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would could tell the different or
you know, so I could Maintain mothers and
[SPEAKER_00]: know which ones which and it just got the
name pre-98 because Shah had Received the
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting in the in the winter of 97 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time it's like 2003 I'm like,
well it had to have been before 1998
[SPEAKER_00]: because someone popped the seeds and has a
clone by now already Pre-98 right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got the name makes it And
that was like 2004 and then it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four years later that swerve
basically Appropriated the name for
[SPEAKER_00]: selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So that's pretty much all there is to
it wasn't anything special it wasn't there
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't anything crazy about it They all
pretty much smell the same the purple was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little bit more purple smelling but
still the bubba with the incense and the
[SPEAKER_00]: like The smell in the air the same meaty
smell The katsu they would all turn purple
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how you grew them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all phenotypically variable
based on environment It was the green fino
[SPEAKER_00]: was the the katsu which It just tended to
be green more often But if you over
[SPEAKER_00]: further it didn't budget very big whatever
it put out little tiny buds It turned
[SPEAKER_00]: purple at the end of flower with cold
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Not a major difference the pre-98
tended to be a little chunkier more often
[SPEAKER_00]: But still the same characteristics as the
other two cuts it would still Like
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what I call like big stem small
bud Yeah, right where you've given it too
[SPEAKER_00]: much cow mag or it doesn't have a big
enough root system for the size of pot
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in Whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you vet it looks just like most bubbles
if you vet your mouth really big they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start actually producing pretty good
That's fucking awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know about I said that people
were asking about the face-off story That
[SPEAKER_01]: would be fucking awesome to hear like
straight from the mouth So the real og
[SPEAKER_00]: kushman the source genetics chris chris
used to live up here in seattle in 2000
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think he lived up here from like 02
to 06 I met him in like 04 And he was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the poison og at the time,
which was his bad seed fino From bags that
[SPEAKER_00]: he had purchased in socal the face-off was
I think he had 12 seeds of face-off bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The face-off was never actually a clone
that was being grown It was just a moniker
[SPEAKER_00]: given to a certain batch of og that went
through the inland empire back in like 99
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that I got six of the
seeds I think four or five of them popped
[SPEAKER_00]: if I remember right the face-off number
four is the cutting that I have right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped it from seed So that's the only
real face-off Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think there's like four or five
more seeds out there chris gave some to
[SPEAKER_00]: Call classic seeds, but I don't think he
ever popped them and i'd be surprised if
[SPEAKER_00]: they even popped now being 20 years old
No, and uh I think chris might have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple more seeds of it, but that's about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome So like so I I
popped the seeds it was the number four
[SPEAKER_00]: fino the number one two and three the
number one was like a It like the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: turned purple It had more of like a in
between bubba and in face-off kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um The number two was like this really
short sativa Um leaf looking thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it didn't stretch at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost like a dwarf plant,
but it had a really really thin blades The
[SPEAKER_00]: number three produced Like much larger
bigger colas was a little bit hermy Which
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of the main reasons I didn't keep
it and it pretty much smelled like Your
[SPEAKER_00]: typical og made with like a little bit of
a gummy bear funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow, and then the number four And and
that the number three and the number one
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of had that similar like gummy bear
in between og and bubba kind of smell the
[SPEAKER_00]: number three was more og dom the number
one was like It wasn't really bubba dom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say but it was just kind of um I
would call it blander, but you know It it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't anything particularly special and
then the number four was um the uh It's
[SPEAKER_00]: the it's that face-off smell like that
Really long-lasting lingering after flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and real cushy flavor Um, and the main
reason I kept it too was it's potency It's
[SPEAKER_00]: always potent like the first time I was
smoking it I rolled up a joint and was
[SPEAKER_00]: driving to town and pick up some hydro
gear This is like 2006 and I smoked it and
[SPEAKER_00]: started getting like lightheaded in the
car and I was like, all right This thing's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty potent probably um, and anybody
that knows me knows I smoke a lot of herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: so um, I I typically don't even comment on
Potency at all because i'm smoking 20 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 different strains a day, you know
between all the different kinds of hashes
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatever else so
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's um It's super hard to work with
I mean, it's um It's a really old strain
[SPEAKER_00]: from up here in the northwest everybody
that like if you're around in the late 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s and 2000 early 2000 smoking weed up
here You bought purple weed and it smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: like the purple indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this really um, Uh Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not well, it's not I mean it's pungent but
it's like if you could think of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple what purple smells like your color
This is everything that purple smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: um And hold on a second i'm gonna take a
toke and then yeah, but um And I got the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut in 2003 it was the very first cut that
I got basically That um, it didn't come
[SPEAKER_00]: with a name either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got it from my friend who Had gotten
a medical card at the time, which was uh
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty hard to get And he had gotten the
cut from some oregon growers I had no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing some 97 dutch passion
blueberry seeds at the time and I also had
[SPEAKER_00]: some Some other blueberry seeds,
I can't remember what they were Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were from canada one of The
canadian blueberry crock is like yeah one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those, you know, um I can't think of
the company names, but you know shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of canvas culture magazine Not like uh bcc
depot but like federation seeds all those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys I can't remember who it was that had
like the blueberry the blueberry nl5 all
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember but those Do you ever try peak
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember peak but I think this was
before peak seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think This was uh, um God,
I can't remember the name, but it'll come
[SPEAKER_00]: to me a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um But basically I was growing blueberry
at the time and when when you cut up
[SPEAKER_00]: clones of The uh purple indica it
literally smells like berries kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: right had a very berryish smell right from
the beginning which is kind of that purple
[SPEAKER_00]: smell too and um So I would I didn't know
what it was right I just Um, I just knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that like it kind of looked like the
blueberry shit So I kind of like was
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it blueberry for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't even flowered it yet So I didn't
even know I was just like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry something or other By the time I
finished the cut I knew that it was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple strains from up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the udub perp Seattle perps to
coma perps ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these were all basically the same
phenos Or not the same phenos They were
[SPEAKER_00]: either Variations of the same variety or
hybrids of the same variety, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was basically the old purple from up
here and it was like pretty widespread and
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew that there was multiple different
cuts because you could um You could
[SPEAKER_00]: basically uh Like when you bought pounds
of it You'd get some bags that all smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: like the purple indica or like ultraviolet
or whatever But if you got the perps like
[SPEAKER_00]: from Tacoma, it'd have like big 20 gram
colas in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever you grew like or whenever you
saw like ultraviolet nuggets They didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: ever have big nuggets and it was always
small little ounce bags of shit Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when I grew out the the blueberry or
the unknown cut, um, uh Basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I start I grew it a few times and I was
like there's no way that this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tacoma perp cutting I don't know if it's
the ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's the udub perp I don't
really know what cut it is because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anything to reference it by In terms
of other cuts, so I called it purple
[SPEAKER_00]: indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was how it got its name,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became PI, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um and Basically, you know there never
really was a purple indica up here as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as I know It was just the perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Um, and it's just a really really
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a dwarf or anything,
but it's a very tight internode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, um afghani plant Um pretty much
anybody I know that's twice my age that's
[SPEAKER_00]: up here in washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: They immediately can identify it as the
old perp um From up here uh kindness
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my buddies from back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He remembers it really well, too um And
and that's what the PI was and it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: lower potency Um, you know 15 to 18
percent and pretty much whatever you cross
[SPEAKER_00]: it to it reduces its potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so, um Yeah, and it's just hard to
work with from from the perspective of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to um uh It's trying to bring a new
variety up to modern day standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, it's Sometimes you cross
stuff in and it like like cookies for
[SPEAKER_00]: example You cross it into stuff that makes
it really frosty and purple which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: the market likes Yeah, you cross the PI
and it makes it less frosty dark purple
[SPEAKER_00]: and not quite as potent but the the funny
thing is potency is um Is so subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah nowadays That like back then the
purple indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always called it shut up We because
anybody load a bomb toke or whatever for
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd immediately just sit there and zone
out um, so even though it always tests
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly was um lower in potency than
a lot of stuff it um, it definitely uh
[SPEAKER_00]: Would bring some people's back
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Lower potency strains are coming
around more now since concentrates are
[SPEAKER_01]: much more In use and available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like they've gotten a renewed
life in them Yeah, a little bit but I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, you know lower potency means lower
yields as well, right so um, I think a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people are just trying to Get as much
bang for their buck, especially from an
[SPEAKER_00]: economic perspective Oh sure sure So what
are you working on now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what a lot of people like
to know about you What are you working on
[SPEAKER_01]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You make fucking amazing shit dosy dough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to top dosy dough I mean,
it's you know, it's it's all personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Um, i'm actually gonna pop all my
old seeds all everything from 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago this next round right now i'm
remaking um All the stock right of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's already i've already gone Through
um And then uh, i'm just gonna i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: go back to the drawing board i'm tired of
this shit i'm working on I can't wait to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking see what you pull up through your
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't even imagine Yeah, um, I mean shit
gets boring, you know, I mean um And
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why people are like, oh someone
else made your shit before you could it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like dude I was working on trying to find
something new not remaking shit just
[SPEAKER_00]: because people are asking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's all personal preference,
you know and what your motivation is And
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all about I mean anybody can make
their shit for you if they don't test it
[SPEAKER_00]: release it Right, like yeah, of course
exactly if you're not going to work it at
[SPEAKER_00]: all I mean you can make it as fast as
someone can sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so um, you know dosy dough took a
while to make And remake because it's uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ogkb is like a type four hermy that
thing Hermes every which way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly get so hybridizing into it you've
got to at least search through the
[SPEAKER_00]: population and look for lower instances of
those Trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep in any way that's not or even doesn't
even know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously doesn't even probably grow their
own fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yeah Everybody's gonna be fucking
bombing you about slurring your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you if you want to tell I mean,
dude I so I can't make purple punch cross
[SPEAKER_00]: with dosy dough, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get it Especially if it's a
happier line in the thing Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, yeah exactly and it's like
well You know if if people are mad about
[SPEAKER_00]: the name or whatever the the funniest shit
is They're the ones complaining about
[SPEAKER_00]: patents on plants, but what trademark
rights for naming shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's you know, you can't you can't
have your cake and eat it, too You got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be one or the other because that's how
patents and trademarks work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not It's I mean, you know,
I think Hypocrisy is the the a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people's motives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean miseducation Education leads to it
and it's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what the world is nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's very true What else you guys
got for him any other questions that are
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking you got him sitting here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ask fucking lame-ass shit Yeah,
who wants to talk about purple punch
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, it's like everything Let's talk
about some fucking historical shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah HP 13 the most common Misinformation
about it is that it's you 13 hashtag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people think that So I I got
the cut I think from Caleb I think he was
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that got it first But I had seen
it earlier for example, like in you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about Jason King's Canna Bible
earlier So the Canna Bible entry that was
[SPEAKER_00]: my herb The Trinity crossed with UW that
was herb that I had purchased that I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed this to Jason King at the 2002
Seattle Hempfest The dog shit that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that was us not the humble Outdoor
pictures, but the pictures of the indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: that was my buddy cannabis reverend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Through another glassblower friend of
ours that grew it That was the dog shit
[SPEAKER_00]: entry that was in there The purple indica
entry that was mine and then Scott reach
[SPEAKER_00]: also reached out to Jason King and I think
Showed him pictures of it, but that cut
[SPEAKER_00]: came for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave Scott that back in the day and So
the first time I saw HP 13 was in 2004 I
[SPEAKER_00]: went to stay with a friend of mine in
Hana, right and he's he was a dude another
[SPEAKER_00]: dude that was on cannabis world and He he
invited me to come out to this party right
[SPEAKER_00]: now I won't tell too much about the party
even though they don't throw it anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was basically a weed gathering
party another another couple buddies of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine that currently live on Maui And it
was basically like it was deep in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was off grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's no I mean they had
power because it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-millionaire's home that this thing
get thrown at so they had refrigerators
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the knives was actually an
off-grid home and You know, they had like
[SPEAKER_00]: kava leaf blunts and fucking homemade
kombucha and like homemade Beer and all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of shit and Jason King also happened
to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time I saw Mendo perps
also that was like 2004 I believe yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 2004 and So HP 13 I'd heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had talked about it I saw some
jungle grown HP 13 that was grown deep in
[SPEAKER_00]: the jungle there and I thought it was swag
It was like but it was just poorly grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it had a really unique smell But
it had like no stickiness to the resin the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell I had to really mash it up because
it was that outdoor shit and But you could
[SPEAKER_00]: tell it had like a unique smell to it and
then I eventually got the cut from CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: humble and I think that was probably
around 2007 or eight was the first time I
[SPEAKER_00]: got it from him and It's it was like it's
a weird plant, you know, it's it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: leafy Very columnar growth just like goes
straight up didn't branch very much small
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and definitely her meat on the
bottoms Wow, and that's where like the P
[SPEAKER_00]: are the Fuck what do they call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The the sour P was a sour diesel HP 13
cross That was all the same group of cats
[SPEAKER_00]: that did this Maui party every year back
then and I still have some friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: those parties that that live all over and
you know, they they remember the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the one of the most impressive
examples that I remembered was the Jasmine
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack which came out of Eugene And that was
it was real hazy smelling but at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: like in Seattle Hazy stuff was like where
it was at that's why the dog shit Malawi
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights haze that I made the nl
haze f2s the pure Malawi gold that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: the super bill all that shit was Was super
that was like what was popular like I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember when I first got og up here from
Chris Nobody even gave a fuck people were
[SPEAKER_00]: like dude, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just some Indica bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right They didn't even care couldn't
yet get anything more for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really even it was it was pointless
Yeah, I just was growing it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: liked it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't you know, like an oh,
oh three oh four Oh five og wasn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: that popular or known outside of Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah That's so I can't ever get anybody
knowledgeable to compact or comment on HP
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 and it seems like everybody who grows
it or run it has different opinions on
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's on keeping whether it's
growing but That's pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that Yeah the the people that
I know it came from the people that Jason
[SPEAKER_00]: King saw it from originally the people
that put it in the Cana Bible Those dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: were from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from New York, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from New York for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my understanding like I The
farthest back that I have any experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and the people that it came from
They have a New York connection and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where that cut came from Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool Yeah, that's why they had the
sour D out there too, right at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time that was all the same group of people
and You know, the scene was really small
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 20 years ago, especially Genetics scene
back then because most people all they
[SPEAKER_00]: gave a shit about was just finding one
good cut and running it till the wheel
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like the deal No one it didn't
really matter what the strain name wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: in those days because everything is sold
for great money Oh sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen him fucking growing in Maui
growing fucking plants and trees and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking gnarly out there Yeah,
that was how that HP 13 that I first saw
[SPEAKER_00]: was grown and it was garbage It was pretty
much garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would be nice about it but dude
Ryan Ryan shit in the jungle is impossible
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looked like I remember I would
ship out a jar weed like I shipped out a
[SPEAKER_00]: jar of Albert Walker for that party in
2004 and literally as soon as I opened
[SPEAKER_00]: that jar my buddy's house the weed got wet
Yeah, you know, it was like cured
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly and was like spongy with the
with the crack as soon as you open the
[SPEAKER_00]: jars It turns into like jungle weed Yeah,
the human it's like 98% humidity or 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like raining basically so as soon as
you open the jar Just takes it it takes it
[SPEAKER_00]: all on I'm not doing any more DS work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not popular enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's longer flowering I'll play with it
every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's actually hard to hybridize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw rich in here earlier also talking
about his dog walker and The scooby snacks
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that people like to make a big deal
out of yeah and like every rich and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutual friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I didn't do it as any intentional
thing I was living in LA at the time had
[SPEAKER_00]: no idea that there was I don't even know
this was 2012 so I don't even know if rich
[SPEAKER_00]: had Made it or sold or given it to people
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah but literally I just made cookies
crossed with fucking um Cookies cross the
[SPEAKER_00]: face on I called it snooze that scooby
snacks and honestly, it didn't even really
[SPEAKER_00]: sell very well and I didn't expect I Had
no idea until I moved back up to Seattle
[SPEAKER_00]: and then started working with my buddy in
Oregon Did I even know that there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: cut out there called snoozy snacks?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean No dog scooby snacks is dog
walker and forum cookies is my Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I mean, I'm you know, we're just
still in here I'm sure you can He can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody but yeah the dog walker which is
our walker og I'm not I'm not sure who
[SPEAKER_00]: made that side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then that hybridized with Chem 91
or chem for I can't remember if rich found
[SPEAKER_01]: out which one it is I think he ended up
saying him for is what he was Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think it was supposed to be chem 91
ended up being chem for I personally
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer the flavor of chem for so yeah It
makes even more sense why I like smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: dog walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my favorite question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, are you Are you going to breed any
more land races?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Mean why are you gonna like it a land
race?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean why would I even try I'm
gonna move to Antarctica and make the
[SPEAKER_01]: first Antarctic land race There you go
Yeah Well, I mean if this means I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop Trying to answer this shit with my
fingers That would be helpful All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I've tried for you know this Matt
I've tried for so many years to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep the information correct I mean
it and it's just every year There's
[SPEAKER_00]: another guy that heard something about the
ocean grown story from fucking Paradise
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds mod John the biggest fucking scammer
ever which can organ kid could come on
[SPEAKER_00]: here and tell everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all him every story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ever told was a lie I got so many
stories about that guy because he lived in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland and I fucking knew him
personally, you know Yeah, I knew him in
[SPEAKER_01]: real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Man that dude would like I don't even
know if he had a wife really, you know He
[SPEAKER_00]: used to have like like stripper hooker
whores and shit around all the time like
[SPEAKER_00]: he had a whole that dude It was a problem,
you know, I made him cry but he was he was
[SPEAKER_00]: how I ended up meeting Ken though,
right Because he was selling Ken seeds at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, right
[SPEAKER_00]: No that came from Ken also Yeah West Coast
dog So So John used to basically find
[SPEAKER_00]: medical patients and get them to make
seats for that seats for him He'd take the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and not pay him anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so he had a couple buddies that were
down here In um, I do know Ken who are not
[SPEAKER_00]: Ken Westfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not who we're talking about but Ken
Ken Doe, who's the guy that's posting
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also in our circle of friends But not
the huh Yeah, I know kendo yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's old school too, but this this someone
was asking if it's kendo that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the answer is no this is totally
different shit and So John used to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys One of the dudes name was
diamond who's the guy that's responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for the udub cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's on the long line It's not you
dub First first of all It was a nice hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but it had no smell of any you dub
I ever bought buying pounds out of you
[SPEAKER_00]: dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um There's many different strings that
came out you dub but none of them I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: saw was that one So there's diamond in his
buddy Jim, right and Ken Ken remembers all
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ken gave those dudes The cuts and I
got those cuts from them and that was like
[SPEAKER_00]: the sour og the ogres The the cutting that
ended up being called the smelly it all
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know personally about Ken named
all that can name and selected all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he he had gotten Sagra Martha 6040
seeds As freebies was shit that he had
[SPEAKER_00]: ordered from gypsy nirvana Gotcha and um,
uh He liked that and crossed it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: og and that's banana og it was freebie
packs from gypsy Um, it was just bulk like
[SPEAKER_00]: basically skunk number one hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cuz that's what I mean I think sam the
skunk man was selling like millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one hybrids back in those days to
all the seed distributor guys Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would all just like package it up
and sell give it away as freebies or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was, you know, um and uh Yeah,
it was just that you know, it's that cross
[SPEAKER_01]: with ogres and then Ken grew it So it was
probably one of sam's uh skunk one hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: as the 6040 I think based on the smell and
and like the way the plant grows the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it washes well all that stuff Leads
me to believe that it's probably um
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably some skunk number one cross just
like pretty much everything else that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown from that era from Amsterdam our
buddy Nick Titus is asking about um,
[SPEAKER_01]: norcal catfish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a shaw bud one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's shaw buds a high school weed
from the early 90s um, and then the socal
[SPEAKER_00]: the socal catfish is a cut that I got from
uh This dude that used to go by the name
[SPEAKER_00]: philly used to run a lot of weight up here
Um, there's a lot of local people up in
[SPEAKER_00]: seattle that will know who i'm talking
about if they were around back then And he
[SPEAKER_00]: brought me uh those cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I did a bunch of work for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, And uh, I actually heard that he's he
uh was at the glass show like uh last year
[SPEAKER_00]: down in vegans Um, it was like a random
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be actually have his phone number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant to hit him up, but uh You know,
I haven't I haven't talked to the guy in a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and he had some uh He had some
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put it that way with the uh
with the law So I you know, and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: really I was always really paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So uh So, you know but but him and I
philly and I have some funny stories Just
[SPEAKER_00]: like of shit that shit that happened like
I borrowed money from him to uh get
[SPEAKER_00]: started in my first uh spot Yeah,
when I bought my first I had those omega
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens that spin around the bulb the bulb
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, so I I had borrowed some money
from him to get going on that right and
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I ended up with like three of those
things Yeah, but so anyways I did like
[SPEAKER_00]: some work for them and move some stuff and
did whatever and uh They brought me a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple big mother plants straight from san
diego Of that cut right and I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: just like cutting up like there was two I
never I've still this day probably haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen plants this healthy, um They were
just like six inch rock wall blocks with
[SPEAKER_00]: mats of roots that were like three feet
long, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like they were doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where you cover with panda film over
top of the uh, the tray Yeah, it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like perfect white roots these things that
just you know been in the back seat and I
[SPEAKER_00]: probably took like 350 cuts off Of those
two plants, you know, they were like
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in clones and anybody that's grown
that san diego cap is cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, uh We'll know how branchy that
thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it puts off cuts like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so Uh, anyways, that's how I got that
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a legendary strain in san diego
along with the uh, on spread p91 and bull
[SPEAKER_01]: rider Do you ever come across the original
bull rider?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw any of those other ones man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only ever saw the campus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it was like oh for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the cap as from philly Yeah,
and cannabis reverend the guy thought my
[SPEAKER_00]: dog shit buddy and our other buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know if he wants to be So i'll
ask him in the future if he wants
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody know who brought our brought our
crew the dog shit um but there's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the the part of this back that I know
that the um dog shit goes is my buddy down
[SPEAKER_00]: in portland Uh, um that owns five zero
trees, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got it in 94 and supposedly it came
from like michigan, I think michigan or
[SPEAKER_00]: mitzvah And it was originally called
electric boogaloo or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: That's um, that's a story that my buddy
that owns five zero trees uh that those
[SPEAKER_00]: group of stores down in portland they were
the first ones that uh That got that cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that that I know of and that's where
that's where they say it came from and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: Your thoughts on trinity I only ever
bought the herb from uh from eugene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ever see like the um I didn't
ever see the cut or know anybody that had
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut correctly All I remember about it
was really was that it had like a I saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple different phenos of it So who knows
what the fuck I actually saw, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but all of them were like very burnt
rubber smelling Um, they weren't like
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, uh like that burnt rubber Yeah,
cushy afghani smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I I don't remember them tasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really well grown, but I don't
remember it tasting um better than uh Than
[SPEAKER_00]: it smelled I remember being the opposite
It's smelling really good and not really
[SPEAKER_01]: having a ton of flavor that the trinity
cut that i've been smoking that uh Came
[SPEAKER_01]: through like the not so dog and those guys
have in caleb that one that one kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tasted me like the old elvis cut which is
real interesting i'm not sure if it is the
[SPEAKER_01]: old trinity Or not, but I they're saying
it is Yeah, I haven't I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really don't know um the uh Like I
said the trinity that I remember all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them smelled like straight burnt rubber
Afghani funk and it was pretty strong
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling but there was no sweetness at all
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no fruitiness There was no like
off smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just basically burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if people confuse that anything
that's not sweet But it's funky with skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, i've been seeing that a lot lately
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call skunk, but there's I think it
also has to do with like I know when i've
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped smoking for periods of of months
and stuff Everything smells way skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Like og smells like skunk ken sour
kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing was fucking super skunky I mean
like if you think gmo has that bad breath,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever smell ask ask ask about the
original Sour kush cut that um organ kid
[SPEAKER_00]: can put out there that thing was fucking
Ridiculous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean comparatively it shits on gmo in
terms of that raw palatosis og funk,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is totally different than the
burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean It's just experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to have seen it to know
the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely Yeah, I think that's everything
That's what we got
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dot 707 seed bank, he knows more
about that than anybody I mean that was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a club cut that used to go through
the third floor at oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I remember about it um I've
seen some blue dot over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but whether or not it was like um The blue
dot that everybody talks about I have no
[SPEAKER_00]: clue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I saw wasn't that impressive
so it leads me to believe that either
[SPEAKER_00]: People are smoking bammer weed or I got
the wrong I saw the wrong Shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean I've been fooled before so
Yeah, or someone said something's really
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome and then you see it you're just
kind of like, oh never mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah See what else you guys got the Maui
Pog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You familiar with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about the Pog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a hb-13 I want to say They're
there would have been that Maui dog or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I know about yeah I mean I've
heard like a bunch of different stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've never really seen enough about it
the Oregon pineapple someone said I Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember buying that herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing the pineapple DS I
remember it reminding me of the Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica shit that was going around Yeah,
and that's what it rumored to be and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that you know that Hawaiian Indica
line was like pretty popular there for a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years one more quick one Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was Chris's brother's cut he lived in
Portland Chris gave me that cut when he
[SPEAKER_00]: think when he moved back or actually I
think I got it from his buddy up here a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years after he moved back to LA
something like that and I Seated it up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the face off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never sold seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But I made seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Albert Walker face Our Albert
Walker manic crossed with that tie also
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave Chris a handful of those seeds
and he's gonna work it just partly an
[SPEAKER_00]: homage to his brother that tie was really
interesting it definitely it was like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like bubble gum and burnt onion or not
burnt onion, but like like a really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting onion smell and Bubble gum and
like a little bit of the super silver
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Hazy back end but not not really like
when you smell it, you don't think haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly that like a tropical cut onion
Type of smell it's pretty unique then Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's super new unique and it was stunk and
I mean it did like the classic little
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas all up the counts is up the Top
colas when it finished up just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: milling too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep What here's a good one and we can end
with this this thing's almost over What do
[SPEAKER_01]: you what project are you most proud of
like looking back on what you've done to
[SPEAKER_01]: this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you most proud of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Man, I just one cog in the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not I just was preserving
genetics because I thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: important and at the time a Lot of other
people were getting rid of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was starting to become like a
marketing game, right it used to Be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow dog shit and it's still sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it was the most in-demand product
Yeah, ten years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the opposite right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wanted the long farts Tivas and
people didn't like smoking them anymore It
[SPEAKER_00]: had become more of a marketing type of
cannabis market than it was before right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so for me is I I'm just happy
that I was in the right place at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: time was able to get a lot of these really
good cuts and kind of put them all in one
[SPEAKER_00]: place and Make sure that they they stuck
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's it Well Hey, dude,
we actually did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on and like
educating everyone in and next time
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully there's next time we talk about
like Albert Walker a lot of people want
[SPEAKER_01]: that so but I appreciate it and thank you
so much and Thanks for everyone for asking
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome questions to do later.
