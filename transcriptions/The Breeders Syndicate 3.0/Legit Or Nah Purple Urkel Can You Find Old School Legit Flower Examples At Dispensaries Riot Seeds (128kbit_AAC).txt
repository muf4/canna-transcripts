[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_01]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_01]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_01]: seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_01]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_01]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to legit or nah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local or otherwise dispensaries with a
goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: My only goal is to see, can we find some
of these old school, legit clone onlys in
[SPEAKER_01]: modern dispensaries nowadays?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can a person that is new to the community
or within the past five to ten years
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonably expect to go to a collective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Place an order for one of these old clone
onlys a flower and either have it
[SPEAKER_01]: delivered or grab it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be pretty confident they're going to
get what we would have seen originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I really couldn't say either
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first assumption was always going to be
that probably that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already seen in some cases OGs that
were so poorly grown, they couldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: identified as OGs or OGs that had great
flavor, but were grown kind of will grow
[SPEAKER_01]: well, but handled shittily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I chose a really weird one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you that stick with the show and
have been with the show a long time know
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have one strain, mainly one strain
that I regularly won't smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't smoke hybrids of it more often
than not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are exceptions to
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it flips me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me hella anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has never hit me right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can almost always identify a strain
with this plant in it because not just
[SPEAKER_01]: from smell or taste, but because when it
hits me sideways, I immediately know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it revolves around this
specific strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do like breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not to say that I have to enjoy
everything that I breed with smoke wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know it's a valuable tool for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that a lot of other people
enjoy it for their particular needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though it may not be for me, I know there
is a need for it, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that said, today we are looking at
purple urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my semi drum roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so yeah, I hit up the same place
as I did last time and noticed there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: purple urkel on the menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought there's no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way because this cut faded out
for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very unlikely to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, so many things are called purple
urkel that aren't related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything purple, anything grapey usually
is called purple urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I've seen lots of green stuff called
urkel that doesn't remotely resemble it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it arrived, the first thing I do
when I get a urkel is I smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is an unmistakable grape,
stunky undertone to urkel that is very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very hard to replicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: GDP has something similar, but not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape ape, similar, not quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: But urkel's pretty distinctive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now to me, I would probably guess this was
outdoor just based on looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll toss a picture up here,
even though it's probably going to get us
[SPEAKER_01]: kicked into some other category.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is not, again, it is about what I
would expect from midsy collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to use my trusty flour mill
grinder here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are going to do the same thing we
did last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to go ahead and get a
sense for the flour once ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: dry, unsmoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how it smells there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to try combustion for
flour, smoking it that way, flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: assessing high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to go to the VRIP,
which is essentially vaping, vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to give me the most
well-rounded idea of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at least grows of strains,
I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specific grows of specific strains,
because you can't really judge a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: strain by one grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure most of you know that by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just in case you don't, that's
something that you want to really pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, they'll go get a cut from
a collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then someone will comment about
online, and they'll be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucked, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And realistically, they don't even know if
they grew the same damn cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just assuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was just not adapted to their
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they aren't even the best grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take all that shit into
account when you hear people's opinions
[SPEAKER_01]: online about stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flour mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the outdoor, just the look of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pricing also told me there's a
good damn chance this is outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I was surprised about,
though, is that it had decent smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know outdoor people are like,
of course it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just don't have that experience with
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked a lot of outdoor, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just don't have that experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: First smell, ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's such a rich grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another smell in there that I
never really paid attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: This flour mill's great for smelling
ground flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gummy bear front.
[SPEAKER_01]: White gummy bear front, grape back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: White gummy bear front, grape back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some skunkiness is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it before, a skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, purple urkel and poodle nuts
specifically, which is very urkel
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant, have the strongest skunk smell
in veg that I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always hear people like,
ah, rub this in veg, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily, again,
it doesn't translate like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not how shit works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is duly noted, something to note.
[SPEAKER_01]: When something has such a strong
distinctive smell in veg, you can identify
[SPEAKER_01]: it in veg later, usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has very specific growing traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel likes to grow very bushy,
short squat, needs a long veg time,
[SPEAKER_01]: broad leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes outdoors, though, it could go
more narrow looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It surprises people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: White gummy bear front, grape back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the first time I've ever picked
up the gummy bear part or even thought of
[SPEAKER_01]: to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just hit me all at once what that
smell to me is on this specific row of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure people argue with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have grown all the real urkels on
Earth, and they all have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: statement.
But no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, just to be sure, because I was
pretty sure that I knew that this was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a legitimate urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I ran it by CSI as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And granted, it's hard to tell legitimacy
from any, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're pretty sure that this is urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I trust his opinion on urkel much more
than mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have experience with it, but he has more
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter how much experience you have
with something, if someone has more
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with it, and they're
intelligent, it's always best to double
[SPEAKER_01]: check yourself, check your own bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just for y'all, let me give myself a
goddamn panic attack on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe my body chemistry has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain chemistry has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've actually been dreading this
review quite a bit because of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's another thing that I did
want to address in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of males, specifically, are very,
what's the word, ashamed to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: when cannabis sends them into dark holes
or dark places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people take that as a, oh man,
you ain't got no fucking tolerance,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ain't got no tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must be a noob if you did that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was one of those dudes when I was
young that would say shit like that and
[SPEAKER_01]: just be like, ah, watch him freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amateurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a man, especially, I can come in as
a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some people wouldn't call me that,
but as a male, your hormones can change as
[SPEAKER_01]: you get older.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that never really affected me like
this when I was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after I quit hard drugs, something
changed in my brain chemistry,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certain things could send me on
really, really painful, dark mental paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not a cure-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a catch-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snake oil that will heal all that ails
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my main points for this season
in explaining about the name game and why
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so important to find a way to educate
the end user that isn't necessarily in a
[SPEAKER_01]: growing restraints, that they cannot rely
on collectives or dispensaries for their
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that seems to be repetitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a recent experience and I'm
going to do a second review on the Luigi
[SPEAKER_01]: OG because I ordered a second batch from
the same place a week later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, as you would expect,
and I'll talk about it in the review,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more to talk about, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, you cannot reliably hope that
your collective will have the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same packaging twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And God forbid you're someone like me
that, you know, goes and picks up a
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry and they switched it out for
hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that can send people, that could
have serious consequences, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: where people are at mentally, how their
day's gone, what's going on in their
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think people take it serious
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people laugh at me all the
time for how serious I take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's goofy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real goofy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of people this far into
medicine that care this much about history
[SPEAKER_01]: or provenance or any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is people rely on this for
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they can't rely on it for that,
you can end up hurting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's the overall reaching point
with a lot of what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: illustrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this is Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Urkel and we're about to find
out if my brain chemistry has changed in a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years since I've smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try combustion first, see if we can
get a good flavor profile, scent profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already gone over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like white gummy bear grape hint of
skunkiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, using my Breeders Syndicate
branded piece from C2 Custom Creations,
[SPEAKER_01]: glassbyc2.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust no one else for my glass,
ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was before we were even
sponsored, even agreed to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agreed to do this because I loved their
glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only work with products I stand by.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, meh.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with combustion, it's really hard to
identify that flavor is grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of earthy flavor to Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just earthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel, and granted, this is an outdoor
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel can be very flavorful indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get the same flavor profile that
I'm used to with Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scents there, the looks there,
I'll know in probably five minutes whether
[SPEAKER_01]: the high is there that I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the flavor is allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to try the old VripTec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll go over this again for the people
that haven't seen view one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using the VripMaster VripTec wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a vape wand that uses, there's a
hole in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sits on top of a bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: This grommet plugs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates an air suction thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is holes on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This side right here and this side,
it creates a vortex of air, of hot air
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes through the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: This never makes contact with the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there is a heat setting part
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, I mark it with a Sharpie
where I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tends to cook for all weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, this is my favorite device ever
for smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: For really assessing turps, high,
it doesn't kill all the blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So volatile turps that usually just get
burned off through combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can taste a lot of sweet
notes that you normally wouldn't taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like blueberry tastes like sugary,
sweet blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would never taste that through
combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wish it was more portable because
this gets in the way pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is you let this sit on there
for five to 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eat it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hit slow to allow everything
to kind of slowly dry in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always exhale first.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's funny is the sweetness hit
the back of my throat as opposed to like
[SPEAKER_01]: the front of my tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can really taste it in the back of my
throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is bizarre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely great flavor all day through
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there's always a really
soft flavor that comes through with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Vrip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very hard to explain,
but it's a soft flavor, if that makes any
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's with every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that every cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that's just the flavor of
cannabis when you use this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the grape is the overall flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's impressive through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, this is Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucking Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, even at a Bakersfield dispensary,
randomly, I didn't choose other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like go through, choose several
Urkels, find one that was real and just go
[SPEAKER_01]: with that and say, hey, I found one that's
real.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first one I went with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was positive that it was not gonna be
legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: One price, two rarity, three age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people got rid of Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people have thought they had Urkel,
had something else in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highway 99 Collective in Bakersfield,
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decent job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who you're sourcing this
from, and I'm not gonna ask, but they did
[SPEAKER_01]: a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do think it's outdoor,
but the price reflected that, so it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: like anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else would I add onto this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a brain chemistry that really,
really likes Blueberry and it brings you a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of anti-anxiety type high,
you might be the type of person that
[SPEAKER_01]: responds to Urkel the way I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot to keep it together and
just be like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it'll put you in a very awkward
position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, especially some of my elders
in the community, they love what they call
[SPEAKER_01]: rollercoaster weed, which is something
that gives them the fear of God,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where at the top thing goes,
ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the kinds of highs I run away
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yeah, I hope you enjoy these
reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started out kind of wondering for
myself if these things were out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: also while trying to learn about some of
this new stuff that neither me or any of
[SPEAKER_01]: my friends grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of the newer hype stuff,
the lemon cherry gelato, the RS-11,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figured while I was already doing
that, I wonder if any of these old strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that I love are still out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can these people reliably get them that
aren't experienced with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they expect to get them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna keep doing it, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you guys seem to like, some people
seem to like it, some people seem to hate
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great, because if you hate it,
leave comments, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still interacting and helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go check out our Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: We interact there a lot.

never know who's next to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people from all sorts of different
parts of the cannabis industry there,
[SPEAKER_01]: even major corporations doing breeding for
them.

[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there's this Sour D Appalachia
and Chem D App F2 and some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna have Miss Jill stuff going
up soon, which may surprise some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Miss Jill have been friends for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Miss Jill have been friends for a
really long time now and I'm really stoked
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring her into the fold.

but I learned so much in that episode and
[SPEAKER_01]: those two dudes are fricking characters
and hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll all enjoy them as well
if you haven't seen it.
