[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-dog, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's your Friday night so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a wide variety of color schemes
to pick from from your earmuffs?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's not.
No?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just periwinkle and yellow was
your only option?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I guess it's extra,
extra small, they have limited colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get you one so that when you do
your audio, it won't bleed in and it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when they say one size fits most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They throw in that disclaimer for my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch like a ball cap just like
creep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can get some lighting
going on in this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a little better maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see your shiny glow from being
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the estrogen I'm taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tonight, we were going to get started
talking about provenance and its place in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in the history, why it's
important now, and even more so now than
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to get started,
I don't know if you remember where we kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of talked about starting off, but kick it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there's kind of like probably
what we'll end up doing is talking some
[SPEAKER_00]: like historical examples of it from the
beginning to like now, because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of it that's relevant right now
actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just kind of like what we need as
far as ethics and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pay check, you know, like both the
hair and the beard are completely
[SPEAKER_00]: unchanged from last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did zero time in the chair before I
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone can see me get progressively
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaggier, more aged as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, there's an aspect
now where like, I guess it's, it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, why do you care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People care.
[SPEAKER_00]: People care for different reasons,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the smallest minority,
of us, which I'd say Matt and myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI and some others are in is the one that
care because it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we're like weed history nerds
and we want to actually know the story of
[SPEAKER_00]: how it came to be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of people that only care
relative to how it helps them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, you know, you know,
when you interview some of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have like the stuff you're so
desperately after, they have that view
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they know it, but they kind of only
care about it in a way that it helps them
[SPEAKER_00]: or how can it help me now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of times what happens is
like, you know, you, you start to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these people and like,
memories are kind of hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they get an idea about what
could happen with it, well, then they get
[SPEAKER_00]: more specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, um, most of it is oral and
most, and some of it is argued,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of it is argued over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes really hard because it's,
there's not a lot of proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we've chatted about this on
previous casts, but you know, when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about like the Ron parties and
stuff like that 20 years ago, where I met
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb and Fletch and a bunch of different
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hunting for old things then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in the last five or six years,
all of a sudden there's been a huge push
[SPEAKER_00]: towards like, well, what was those
eighties and nineties genetics like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're absolutely everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this situation where,
you know, it doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it takes is one scammer to have,
you know, 74 Colombian or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not actually that and it gets
passed through some good hands and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like Bitcoin washing or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets like, it gets its reputation gets
verified through others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of aspects of that,
of how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, um, it's kind of a
conversation that like could go,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, any number of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but maybe I'll start in the beginning,
which is I remember reading uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that, uh, Sam Skunkman wrote about
how pissed off him and Rob Clark were in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early eighties that like 5% of growers
gave a shit about genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5% would be massive now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an aspect where it's like
same as it ever was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what we're about to chat
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were bitching about it in 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because, and I don't even think that's
wrong necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a lot of people like,
I live in Mendocino County, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of weed land and it's been
going through some seismic shocks lately,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as all that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really start to see the people
that, um, are in it for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in it for spending cash or we're
in it for ease or we're whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a lot of people were into
weed because weed, I mean, Matt's seen
[SPEAKER_00]: this with the seed game from when he
started to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big influx and then a big outflux.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, I mean, people are dropping
like flies out of the sea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people that we thought would
probably be around, you know, no matter
[SPEAKER_02]: what, I was kind of shocked, you know,
it happens though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, some of it is, some of it is
breeding is a pain in the ass too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, it's like maybe a band,
maybe it has a, a one to five year life
[SPEAKER_00]: for most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really hard to make a 20 or
30 year career out of breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not being able to go anywhere,
not being able to take vacations,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that comes if you're, if you take
breeding very seriously and collecting
[SPEAKER_02]: very seriously provenance, all that that
you can say goodbye to all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's like for, if you, if you compare
it to music, having a, being a one hit
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder means you're more successful than
most musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you still had the one hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cause you had the one hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have like a period of
dominance for like five years or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, that's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number of bands that stay relevant
over 15 or 20 years even is a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of everyone famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine you have some huge hits for
breeding and then five or 10 years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then five years later, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you keep making hits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you keep yourself relevant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen very few, um, seed makers be
able to keep themselves relevant unless
[SPEAKER_02]: they had like a big marketing budget,
you know, and high times ads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, it's, it's, it's always
an up and down battle for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, there's a,
there's an aspect too, where, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to put it like that,
but that's what happens when I read
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, you know, I can get totally
thrown off track, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there's a thing now, like,
if we, if we go from, from what Sam said
[SPEAKER_00]: to now, now all of a sudden it's important
to have old cuts because people are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to differentiate themselves on the legal
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of new smokers who are
interested in these legendary things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and therefore there's money to be made
and rep to be had by having them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, one of the things Matt will
tell you this too, one of the main ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a breeder is let's say you end up being
a guy that's associated to a super famous
[SPEAKER_00]: cut, even if you weren't the breeder,
but you were just somebody that got it
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those people have seed companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do, they have a famous name,
so they do breeding around what got them
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hopes that like people that are
interested in that would want to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: from some OG tied into the chem or the
sour, the cookie, what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's background, he has decided he is
going to, uh, out, outpace me weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have no figurine competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even come close.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he does have, he does have
figurines, but they all have big dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't put them up and they're all
sent to me from Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if you've ever been
on the riot Christmas list, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really all it is, is like palace art.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a large collection and I have doubles
of a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's, you want to,
you want to avoid getting on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even, I'm not even dissing
people, but it's like by any means,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, like, you know, nor Cal IC mag around,
around, uh, OG KB, you know, or cornbread
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricky, you know, around TK or anyone,
anyone, anyone you get famous by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people do breeding sort of
based around their famous cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there's an aspect where it's like,
one of the best ways to become a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: where people buy your seeds is like
claiming that you're associated with shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big claim, the big claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these claims, like,
it doesn't even matter if they get refuted
[SPEAKER_00]: later on, as long as they help you with
your rise on the way up and build your fan
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's ancient skunks or this or
that's, or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, just to get yourself known and
on the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you know, so we did what
we'd was never ready for modern marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we have this running joke in
our crew called the pre pre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is all these strains that people
have that exist before the strain existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see this, like we'll talk,
we'll make jokes like, Oh, we mentioned a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that probably hasn't been brought
up in 10 to 20 years publicly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we like, fuck shit in two weeks,
we're going to see it and then sure
[SPEAKER_02]: enough, two weeks later, someone's like,
yeah, I got that cut and it's right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pre pre it encompasses a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre pre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, there's we're not,
I'm not going to be big on like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like names or anything like that on this
particular episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more going to be like actions and
themes because that's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's parts where it's like,
okay, like somebody's got, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 93 cents a star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it got released in 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or I've got 95 black Domina,
but Domina didn't get released until the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup in 96, which is in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these things where it's
like, there's these cuts and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like the earliest they could
possibly be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a year or two earlier,
sometimes decades earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a 79 blueberry floating
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when, you know, DJ says that he
got his Afghan to start the project,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in 79.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then blueberry isn't blueberry,
like an F four F five F four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: F four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he did, he did multiple
generations and testing and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's someone that has it,
that's his from like before he,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the, the year that he
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I see the most is super skunk that
has like the most years around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause nobody cares to look up when it
popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just said there's an, there's an
89 super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got released in the 90 catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, sour was found.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think sour was found in
95.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, it was found in 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the diesel one and two was found in
95, but a lot of people's sour goes right
[SPEAKER_00]: back to summer and 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that pre the pre-cut before that
pre-cut there's because most people
[SPEAKER_00]: really, when it boils down to it,
it's like, it's almost like testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: like has what what's happened with THC
testing where it's like the the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab knows that both the dispensary and
the grower want a high test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that way everybody makes more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market knows that these earlier
dates do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus these earlier dates appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, I've had this running joke that
like with the magic of a Sharpie and a
[SPEAKER_00]: label, ancient gems are unearthed all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want them to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every once in a while, a few of them
are true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, it gets, it gets earlier
and earlier and earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you try to refute it and it's
like whack a mole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, and you know,
and it's like, so provenance provenance
[SPEAKER_00]: with seeds is really hard because they're
just beans and they all look fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, how the, how would you know
if it's an 85, you know, uh, the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify old beans is they don't crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't crack very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, or they, none of them pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're not viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe these were really old because they
didn't, none of them worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's really frustrating because
they're only fresh for about five to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's stored properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one summer in a bad closet or in a hot
garage can dramatically lower their
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan or even kill all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so now we're in this
situation where I, I, I did, I did didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: shave this week for street cred.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the gray, uh, because all
these 90 strains are coming back around
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people didn't experience them
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore people can sell them to you
and you have no personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you like my 89 super skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like my 93 cents?
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw my 95 black Domina, my,
you know, my pre Sam skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the, this is the, this is the Sam
started in 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from before them when it was
still rank or the pre pre Hayes brothers
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, whatever, whatever it might be
going back even way before I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: born.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still have stuff and people that
have been like secret and doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing repros and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every once in a while that stuff does
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does happen from time to time that
someone comes out with a legitimate,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not been online and I have been
holding this, this exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, we don't want to rain on,
uh, every parade that pops up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we could be pushing away good
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you don't want to be like,
there's this, uh, there's this,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this, there's this funny,
like from the welfare at feral era of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, of, uh, Saturday night live where like
there's these two gay kids that work in
[SPEAKER_00]: this clothing store and no one's good
enough to shop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone that comes in, they just
insult them relentlessly until they leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you get tired because
some of it is obviously impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll be like, you call them
out on the pre pre and they'll be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, my buddy got it directly from
the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be pre release, but my buddy got
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they just go along and they just change
on following posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just update the year to the earliest
year possible and go along with that new
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those other posts get deleted and they
just adapt and move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we were talking about starting
doing this podcast together, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the main things that me and not so
we're talking about, and we've talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about this before, but, um, are we doing a
disservice to the community by putting
[SPEAKER_02]: more info out there that is accurate to
the, to the letter when it comes to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to know knowledge, you know, because it's
actually helping people craft their
[SPEAKER_02]: stories more craftily.
[SPEAKER_02]: But luckily, usually the people that do
that are so lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really, they leave holes all
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it leads to conundrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, somebody was saying about,
you know, various, you know, the NL five
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, I think I'm actually going to do a
post on IG soon and like a little like
[SPEAKER_00]: mini podcast talk on it that we have
planned just because most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some real pictures of NL five
that Neville had, but most people haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, and haven't put it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are posts that Neville made
where he talks specifically about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and certain aspects of it and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and most people haven't seen that
either.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's a part where
it's like, I'm such like an old weed nerd
[SPEAKER_00]: that like every old story, God,
I want it to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be true, but the other part
of it that's really weird and maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: bring this up and it's kind of rambling,
but there's a lot of people on IG,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, this is going to be shocking that
like, aren't the way they act on IG in
[SPEAKER_00]: real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a whole group of people
that find people on IG like me or others
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like, I want these cuts that I see
this guy posting about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does he want?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try to convince you that they
have it so that you can, they can get what
[SPEAKER_00]: you have by trading you something you're
after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing trades, please,
please be very, use some critical thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and if you're looking for stuff
that's older, rare, don't send someone a
[SPEAKER_02]: list of your want list because if they
come back and send you everything on your
[SPEAKER_02]: want list, there's probably red flags to
be thrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's older, rare, and some people are
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking, what happens is if
you get bamboozled out of cuts or you get
[SPEAKER_00]: traded, you trade, you know, old rare shit
you have, that's awesome for club cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that they renamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people stay quiet about it because
they don't want to be embarrassed that
[SPEAKER_00]: they got to take advantage of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they don't want to lose the monetary
value of what they just bought and want to
[SPEAKER_02]: pass on the fucking butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they end up breeding with it
for a few times before they realize what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have a bunch of seeds they
made with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, there's a lot in weed of
like, you know, a small percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: people know a bunch of stuff that's not
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets kept quiet for reasons like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so, and then some,
what those scammers do is then they use,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a post with a big
picture, but yeah, that is NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Neville's mother that he used to
make NL5 haze, NL5 skunk one, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only NL5 cut he used in
breeding at Sensei in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but there's people that
let's say they, once they, here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not going to name names,
but let's just say, you know, they've
[SPEAKER_00]: managed to trade with some well-regarded
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it makes it easier for them to trade
with others because some of that guy's,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, he likes them and trades with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy must be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also gives provenance, seeming
provenance to the cut because now it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gone through someone reputable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it's gone through someone
reputable's hands, it adds that stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get two or three people to buy into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all of a sudden they got two or
three well-known people that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: trace real, now they have really good cuts
mixed in with their club renames.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can, oh, I got it from this
person and that person, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, and they got it from this
person and those people are all
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was a thing and we don't call
it that much anymore, but like there used
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a thing long before you could sell
clones and not be ostracized because 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, that's certainly what would
have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a thing that we used to call
trade baiting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And trade baiting was basically trading
people to get a cut that you thought would
[SPEAKER_00]: unlock a bunch of other cuts for you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Chem D or various different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would get it, promise to not give
it out and then use that to get 15 or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of how like fakes got
spread because some people got cuts only
[SPEAKER_00]: with the intention of using that to unlock
other things they wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how a lot of stuff spreads.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that want, that need, that FOMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Adam Smith, like the invisible
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have a want, there's going to be an
invisible hand that brings the goods or
[SPEAKER_00]: services to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people out there that if they
don't have that, they'll just say they
[SPEAKER_00]: have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they want what's in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where, you know,
so now we have a bunch of – so when old
[SPEAKER_00]: strains were unpopular, it was really,
really hard to find anybody that would
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, I've got old shit because there
wasn't any money in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a bunch of money in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seemingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seemingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stuff gets awash and you've got,
oh, I've got 89 this and I've got this and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got that and I've got, you know,
and it gets laundered through a few
[SPEAKER_00]: respectable people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those respectable people
breed with it a couple of times and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes provenance so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everything comes out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing really that's written
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing that's easily proved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all person to person honesty chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I'll use an example of something
that I consider to be like really good
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Greg pops what the dog,
which became called the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives it to my buddy, Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staten gives him the skunk and comes west.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that, Staten gives it to skunk VA,
myself and another friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've all had it since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a short chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody agrees on both sides that it
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we would call really excellent
provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the people involved are
believable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timeframe is believable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, and, and all that,
uh, and then we have stuff that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: really bad problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, uh, something that,
that Matt and I have been trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out recently is does the actual cut of
Kush that Matt, Matt Bubba and Joe D and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, Josh did that did, does that
still exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, the provenance on that one
is hard because they lost it multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: times and it got renamed in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like half a dozen different
cuts that all claim to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have original ghosts, they claim
that to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have original 92 OG, they,
they consider that to be a legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first SFD is supposed to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you think of others?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking of something that
makes the, the chem 91 story a bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: complex because when you have a situation
where someone, you know, has, has a good
[SPEAKER_02]: reliable transaction and we have reliable
provenance getting it to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next thing he passes out and
like, for example, Chem D in a short
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time, two people get two
different cuts and no one can quite
[SPEAKER_02]: remember who got which cut first,
but it's such a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really tell which one would be
considered the original or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point it becomes, is an
unreliable narrator always unreliable or
[SPEAKER_02]: can we just get it wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once somebody said SFV is it, there's more
than one SFV cut that floats around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a seed line was released called SFV,
there was no more trying to dig up just
[SPEAKER_02]: SFV without running into a thousand of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I mean in the sense that
there's some things that are fairly well
[SPEAKER_00]: agreed upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's a lot where the
provenance gets lost or murky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of, and it's kind of like,
and then in that case, it's, it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, it suffers from renames.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ghost of right now, isn't the ghost
that was getting traded 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, and, uh, you know,
there's, you know, like the eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's people that have the old
AJ's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people that have the,
another AJ's sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep trying to figure out if stony puff
and stuff in here is the stony puff and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from, um, overgrown and cannabis
world and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess that's a good person for
provenance for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess he could clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get you, you know, he could probably
clear it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it becomes too, it becomes
like, uh, that becomes like based on your
[SPEAKER_00]: trust or your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets to be pretty small circles that
know what's verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have people all the time,
like in legal California, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect where, um, you know, it's almost
like all these strains are like punk rock
[SPEAKER_00]: bands that never signed with a label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody owns them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this like multi-billion dollar
industry that's getting developed and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these sharks are looking around like,
nobody owns any of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody controls the rights to these cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the beauty of a black market
industry and a clandestine industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it leaves a lot of room for snakes
to come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the only reprisal is, is physical.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not like legal reprisals for
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that doesn't mean that there's
not people that are going to like
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and try to control it and say,
this cut is it because they want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: money off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's a risk that it's
like, imagine somebody else tries to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine somebody tries to, to,
to, you know, trademark the chem 91 and
[SPEAKER_00]: then anybody else growing it or using it
has to give them kickbacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all this weird stuff where
there's like, there's all this
[SPEAKER_00]: compartmentalized tribal knowledge about
cuts and it's not widely known a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people use that murkiness to hustle a
lot of fake history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even sometimes some of the most people
that would be in the know, some of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: timers, they're part of that same
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they'll tell you there's plenty of
old timers that have come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows and ended up scanning people
because they have probably their name
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, who they were, where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a famous incident
with, um, you know, the G 13 cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a little weird, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, the person that was offering
it and selling it, for a lot of money had
[SPEAKER_00]: impeccable provenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a scam.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember, it was double D's cut of G
13.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that Dr. Green thumb said he had,
then double D's said, don't use my name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't get it from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly, that's how it
went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville at the time when we were talking
said that that's not the cut, but then
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville also had told me, hit up Dr. Green
thumb and get some of them seeds for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows where that story really landed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly kind of the thing where it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get claims, there's sales happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get arguments by various people
involved who all don't agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are tempted to buy it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody knows that controversy,
uh, sells seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, there's, there's also people
that I won't name, uh, that I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sociopathic in the seed game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they said something that I think
was really revealing one time,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though people were giving them a lot
of shit about, a lot of fake releases,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, everything I released sells out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see that that was what
mattered to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of these people for seed,
you know, for seeds, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really what matters to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want them to sell for the pack price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the truth is genetics for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is, uh, a cut of my Maui,
uh, by super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it was, it was, uh, seeds I gave
to Mandelbrot and he found, he found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, apparently some Rasta he was
smoking with said this weed is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he got super buzzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's the moniker that got added
onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, he's saying Canon,
uh, stony puff and stuff again,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emory, almost every seed maker post
Neville either added mystery confusion,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, or some lies in order to sell seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly, Stoney's the PNW
hash plant guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I have his name in my head
right now because of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, and there's, you know,
and basically now we're in this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, where, you know, the history might
become valuable because almost every eight
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties and nineties famous line is
starting to have its day in the sun again,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting offered his seeds and people
claiming to have the real deal Holyfield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one thing I'd like to cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that is how, how, how groups and
clone groups were formed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we did kind of touch on,
you know, going to the parties back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, but I've noticed that, that that's
one of the questions I get from some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the youngsters in our, our breeder
syndicate discord chat is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do I even get to these groups with
these cuts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how does that even work?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a foreign concept to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, you just make friends
with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you talk, you shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times you're not even talking
about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you shoot the shit with someone,
you're just talking about what you have in
[SPEAKER_02]: common.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time people decide, okay,
this person's full of shit or they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we share because we're friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's kind of how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a slow process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you don't ever share anything,
you know, in a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you share everything you have
in, you know, that's how it goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's how the groups used to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a lot different than,
than just going and buying the cuts today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if people, the grail of, to me of,
of that kind of situation, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like go Jedi master or whatever,
and you get beyond most trading and people
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to give you things is that you
just have to be honest about what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: after and what your intentions are the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're honest and people like
you and you're not pulling anything on
[SPEAKER_00]: them, cause you're honest, like you,
you, you know, you get, you get into more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more different groups because there's
only so many collectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always been the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants what's hot and what sells
for a high dollar, but actual collectors
[SPEAKER_00]: that are holding onto things for like how
they breed or they love the weed or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, when people pass me these lists
that people send them like clone lists and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, Hey, do you think this person would
have this or that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I think is who is this
person connected to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does this person know that I know
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in these groups because you know,
usually if they're showing off like a
[SPEAKER_02]: really rare clone, it's like, okay,
who's he connected to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would he have had access to to get
this cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that very likely?
[SPEAKER_02]: How rare is the cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do we know that's currently holding
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all involved in provenance and
looking through it and trying to figure it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, a lot of times it doesn't add up
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a, you can have a situation
where, you know, a lot of us know each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Matt was just talking about,
it might involve a few phone calls and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, and like cross reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and because there's a
thing too, we're like up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and there was like, there's,
you know, we'll get to it in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a nugget that created the
show essentially, or the idea for the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, it's really hard to get people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes me, that's what makes me
laugh so much is that it's so hard to get
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone to hold on to old things that
whenever you just see a tsunami,
[SPEAKER_00]: of old things, you're like, well,
shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, I wish there was no,
and the thing is, is that, so everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: asked me about my, like my collection and
all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, my collection is basically
like, I'd like to say that it had some
[SPEAKER_00]: like master plan or I knew eventually one
day, you know, I mean, I like to breed and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like holding onto plants, I think are
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that sometimes, but mostly it's,
you know, it's stuff I personally like to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't care if it was valuable to
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was valuable to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, most people just
want what's easy to sell right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll dump whatever they were
selling before that isn't as easy as the
[SPEAKER_00]: new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, you know, did I think one day
holding onto all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't have, you know, a bunch of my
old cuts because I had some master plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had old cuts because I liked growing
them in the greenhouse or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and having some head stash along with
whatever else I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I liked making hybrids with them
because they're my, and then maybe I get
[SPEAKER_00]: better wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that's not, most people,
honestly, they hold onto cuts because the
[SPEAKER_00]: value that they put on the cut is
monetary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether by breeding with it, selling
clones of it, or selling flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I saw someone just made a
comment that, you know, like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: provenance is shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the flour, make it produce flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's cool, except for the fact that
a lot of the times that the cuts people
[SPEAKER_02]: are hunting, they've never had any
experience with the flour before in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are they ever going to then smoke
the flour and be like, yep, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have the experience with it in
the first place to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I agree with that, if you don't
have the experience with it in the first
[SPEAKER_02]: place, it doesn't really do anything
better than trying to establish that oral
[SPEAKER_02]: history.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, luckily we're not so far forward
that a lot of these people are totally
[SPEAKER_02]: gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are still around that we
can, you know, trace hand to hand to hand
[SPEAKER_02]: to hand back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's an aspect where it's
like, how old is your memory?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you had a cut for X,
or I had a cut for X amount of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you go 10 or 15 or 18 years
without seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just because you had it,
are you certain to be able to 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: identify it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the problem we have with Trinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the reason that nobody's like me,
CSI, no one's willing to say, yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the fucking one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as much as I would like to,
and as much as it would probably sell
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds better if I were, it's just like,
it just, the memory isn't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half my crew thinks it is, half my crew
thinks it isn't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and someone just said trades
used to happen off samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how hard it is for me to get
samples from people of strains that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have, of flower that they grew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people get clones just to
flip them for other clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to build their stable, or to this or
that, or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an aspect where you know,
it, I don't know, memory gets tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And psychosomatic stuff is always a factor
too, and bias and wanting to have it there
[SPEAKER_02]: again, like finding that old, you know,
forgotten clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're already wanting it to get so it can
be it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just said, one thing I will agree
with is that the Trinity cut that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: and is floating around, is really good
weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of the truth of it or not,
it's enjoyable, it's very enjoyable smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also similar, it's also similar a
little bit to the train wreck Trinity that
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew from, Jill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a lot of similar traits to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that was an older cut using
the old Trinity, but I'm not 100 on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's a thing too now where
it's like you, you know, there's certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that I've had for long, long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, if I was to lose the chem
dog or something, like I would be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize if it was real again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've been growing it since the late
nineties and I've grown it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super unique looking and
smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I just have such a relationship,
like the smell of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like the look of it and the way it
makes me feel, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not something that I had like a
short term relationship with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like something you were like,
like you were married to your wife for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could, you can, you can hear her
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's, you know, it's just,
that's kind of, some things are like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, it's, it's hard because most
people in weed and there's nothing wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with this are younger and they want access
to their history and all these famous old
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts and they're willing to give up money
or see, you know, or other clones or this
[SPEAKER_00]: or that or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a, there's a group of
people that are ethical about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a group of people that aren't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's somebody that's asking me,
Oh, we need S ones that LA Cush bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and so I don't know if like,
this is kind of like, we're almost an hour
[SPEAKER_00]: in, so maybe we'll chat about it,
but Matt, Matt spoke about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we joke about how, you know, we'll talk
about something, not that we're super
[SPEAKER_00]: important, but like you start talking
about something and you, and you get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get people also talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden you see it pop
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt, Matt, and myself, we were
discussing it this week and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the last eight months,
10 months, there's been three different
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders that have put out seeds that have
by the not so as LA Cush label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so as headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in the previous 15 years,
that label didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one time anywhere ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you know, uh, whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden I start talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only does the name it's it pop up,
but my name gets associated with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time your name got associated
with it originally was when in our group,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause there were two different headbands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like the one that we had and the one
that you had, and we had to identify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would have like referred to it as
that, you know, but it was never a popular
[SPEAKER_02]: name before we would talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of how some of these
internet names, like none of us ever use
[SPEAKER_00]: the term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the term chem 91 often now because
it's a good communication tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of us ever called it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an internet term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the skunk VA cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an internet term.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, it was never set,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I get that people might
want to like attach names to cuts because
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, for me, I was anti it
happened anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, some people attach their name
to cuts intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they know they had nothing to do with
it, you know, like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: loop ahead band, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he got the cut from someone else
and he decided, I'm going to say it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed in the world and it's my week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and uh, um, you know,
and uh, you know, and then there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's this aspect where it's like,
it puts me specifically in this weird
[SPEAKER_00]: conundrum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, um, there's a small group of people
out there that think that I'm chatting
[SPEAKER_00]: with all you guys every week that Matt and
I, in order to do some like long running
[SPEAKER_00]: scam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most people can't, most people
don't actually like, um, what's the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't think how you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people think that what would I do in
his shoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since most breeding is about money and
it's not about love or cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that, like they feel like
there has to be something for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chat about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and I chat about stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generate some interest, which is very
kind of y'all to have interest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's interest in these seeds and
these cuts and this, this and this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but I don't sell that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a small group that thinks,
Oh, this is what's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I'm not doing it, there's
another group that's just adding my name
[SPEAKER_00]: to shit and you can buy my clones that my
name on it or my hybrids with my,
[SPEAKER_00]: with my strains that from people I've
never met or, you know, and, and I can,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can verify he's not coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't even breathing hard before he
said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, so, um, so then what do you
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, so, if I offer it,
then like it, I wasn't about the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to pump y'all up into
some bullshit to sell it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if I don't offer it, other people
are going to offer it to feed the desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've gone, nobody's used the word
not so as headband in 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have three different people
using it to breed with in the last eight
[SPEAKER_00]: months and clones of it for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people have never reached out to
me or talk to me or this or that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or give me, given me flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like you done any kind of like basic
investigation to make sure that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they think they have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of work, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like, all of a sudden
somebody sends me something and goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, did you give your buddy,
uh, did you give your buddies,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the, the cuts so we can make beans?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you get mad about it,
they just like it because then it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: more controversy and people, some people
will think, Oh, he must have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's mad because he must have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's not even a thing
where I'm like, Oh, you can't call
[SPEAKER_00]: something headband unless I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how, if you've never met me or smoked
my flower, how the fuck do you know it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it's gotta be the same one that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a, there was a cut this
week that got some controversy that Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it turns out it started its life as J
plant speaker sour that was bought from a
[SPEAKER_00]: club and then Jay got mad and it got
renamed the real sour and now it's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's not so as headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be the story, but that wasn't the
first story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is one of those, it's one,
and then, you know, and then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments and anger back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even want to say names because
it's not, that's not, that point's not
[SPEAKER_00]: important, you know, but it's just one of
those things where it's like, I have
[SPEAKER_00]: people all the time on this show DM me,
can we get cuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we, this can we that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've never really done that to the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it mostly in private to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if I don't do it public,
there's going to be scammers that see
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an opportunity and just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people are going to get scammed
on the catch 22, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a funny thing too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's like, I see this with headband
and sour all the time and I'll keep
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it because it's,
it's relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously diesels and headbands and sours
are sort of kind of having their time in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a brief five or six year period
of not popularity as purples and various
[SPEAKER_00]: things swept the land again, but now
they're coming back and everyone wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the oldest realist best cut of
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can sell flower or seeds at high
prices to people that want to experience
[SPEAKER_00]: the real deal or clones or clones or sell
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: For three, five, 300, 500, 800,
thousand bucks, whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know that I have, I don't know
that I I've had, I got the sour 22 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the headband a year after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 21, so oh, 2000, 2001 right in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know their provenance before they
came to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came to me with a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know for sure that my cut is the
original diesel who cut that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that I've had it since this
year and never lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know what sour is the right sour and
the real sour and the one that Manny found
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bag of weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that either, but I've had it
since 2000 and I haven't lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people that are selling these
ancient cuts now got these diesel cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: within the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're either history of it
doesn't even go back very far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're saying is your cut must be
the Albany sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the funny part is that five
years ago, because there's a story too,
[SPEAKER_00]: that Matt and PIP and a bunch of friends
kept asking me, well, which cut is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it a long time ago and it came
helpfully labeled sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought I had sour D and so I
never traded anyone ever for sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I, I had the cut and I never
lost it and I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then Matt and PIP and other friends
start telling me, well, there's res cut
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's Shroomy and there's Amish and
there's ECSD and there's Choco and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: New York city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I start collecting all these things
and growing all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends up, none of them are my
headband and none of them are my son.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when I collected all those,
there wasn't anything called the cat
[SPEAKER_00]: skills cut that the Albany cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, there's a bunch of Amherst,
no Amherst, no, you know, no J plant
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker of which I know he doesn't really
like his name being attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there's about half a dozen new sour
names that have just come up in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone ties back to the mid nineties
guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these people, if you ask them
how long they personally held the cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a, it's, it's a, you could count the
number of years on one hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I don't know that my
shit's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I like it a bunch and I know
that I've had it a long time, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't seem like the chain goes all the
way back to when it started, where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed where like people have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone just claims they have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of these people want to send it
to the original sour people for
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmation.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they just don't have a clue who they
could send it to that's in the sour tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people still think that whoever goes
on the podcast and claims that they have
[SPEAKER_02]: yells the loudest that they're the sour
guy is, is who it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rez got his sour cuts supposedly in Oh
seven, you know, Oh six, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he released the line called sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I BL, which made it even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, people would get bag
seeds and call their bag seed sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a bunch of people right now
selling cuts for hundreds of dollars that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very, very, very sure that it's
the oldest and the best and the realest
[SPEAKER_00]: deal and selling you expensive flour to
try real sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there's a bunch of desire for
it, there's not a bunch of ethics around
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can whine and bitch and moan and
ask questions and then they just get
[SPEAKER_00]: pissed off and their buddy and their buddy
and their buddy and they find out the
[SPEAKER_00]: names of who it came from originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's who just had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there's another aspect that I
had written down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one like, this is,
this is the conversations I have with a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people that sell seeds behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and one of the ones that's repeating
that we, we always come back to is how do
[SPEAKER_02]: you compete in a market of dishonesty
where the loudest, the cheapest or the
[SPEAKER_02]: most expensive it is what usually sells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily who can prove that
they've sourced it correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with what sells in
all honesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very few people care about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a market where the name is what
selling along with the trademark and
[SPEAKER_02]: brand, how do you compete?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try to do it the right way,
when it takes months, it takes years to
[SPEAKER_02]: source something correctly at sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then looking through the line,
then testing the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you compete in a market like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us have ever figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the, Matt's in the seed market
more in the flower market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing where you try to grow
the, I try to grow the, you try to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the best weed you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not everybody does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people try to grow, you know,
just barely good enough to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's kind of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been the market, but if you
grow really good dank, then you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to battle with brokers that always tell
you that they can get cheaper dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since their goal is margin,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rather buy something worse that
they get a bigger range on in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability that week than something
better with a narrower range where they
[SPEAKER_00]: give a fixed price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'll always, they'll be like,
if they, if they look at you and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the best weed I've seen in six
months, they're not going to offer you
[SPEAKER_00]: more for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but they're going to,
everyone tries to kick the tires and make
[SPEAKER_00]: your weed worth less so they can get
bigger margin from whatever they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the same, it's the same
thing with like, with, with flower even is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you can grow real flower,
but like, you know, and there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: people up in my neck of the woods that got
used to get pissed off and just got used
[SPEAKER_00]: to growing bee weed because that was what
sold and that's what moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it like, why put in the, all the extra
effort?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the market's so tanked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, you know, they, they haven't
grown fire in a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've grown decent commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used to be able to survive off
decent commercial and now they can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so same thing with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, they, you're going to
flood the market and then you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation where if you're ethical and you
want to test stuff before sale,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's always going to beat you to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why when people are saying,
you know, like, well, I'll just throw the
[SPEAKER_02]: fire into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire will prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, greenhouse, let's look at the,
the top of the industry, greenhouse DNA,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like a dynafem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the top of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in, in the U S you got compound,
you know, burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the top of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you really think fire is going to
make it through all this when that's the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the, the market's customer driven and
customer driven means that rappers
[SPEAKER_02]: probably are driving the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at what point does fire win?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I laugh when people from Florida and
Virginia and Georgia, I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not, it's not like I'm laughing at
them, but it's like when people from these
[SPEAKER_00]: various States are like, Oh man,
you California and you just grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the brokers that, that brought it
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably had a different choice,
but they made more money off the booth and
[SPEAKER_00]: they still thought you'd buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what they're bringing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insisted upon real fire and refused
to buy the booth, they'd have to change
[SPEAKER_00]: their game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were buying the booth for cheap
and flipping it to you for a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and their margin was better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, booth exists for a reason in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and there's an aspect too,
where it was like this week, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and once again, I'm like, I won't mention
names or anything, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt got upset cause my name got used and
you know, the person's response was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically like, Oh, he's just butt hurt
that we beat him to making seats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have, you know, I could have been
begging not so for that cut when we met
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've never asked him for it once,
you know, you know, and it's because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they know that there's like,
there's a market out there for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people that are excited to try
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm not feeling that market,
they're like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll beat them to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll do it better than he can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just trying to sell something.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six months later, a complaint that the
cross didn't come out the way you thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people don't pop their seeds
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even six months, most people are
working at two and a half, three years
[SPEAKER_02]: before they get to the seeds that they
purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seed game, much like the flower
game, as Matt will say, is in rough choppy
[SPEAKER_00]: waters right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sales are down and expenses are high and
volume is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are searching for whatever
little edges they can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so it's a real issue where
it's like, people ask me, so if I was to
[SPEAKER_00]: do something where I was to like offer up
cuts or offer up seeds and try to fill a
[SPEAKER_00]: demand that a bunch of people have,
I would be selling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I don't, other people are going to,
and are going to, and are doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not even real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason why Matt and I
started this podcast was just to give
[SPEAKER_00]: certain weed heads an opportunity to hear
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there was just a sea of self-serving
disinformation and infomercials and some
[SPEAKER_00]: really bad, not that there's not some
quality talks out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't everybody feel bad, but like
just, you know, an attempt to like get,
[SPEAKER_00]: get some, at least some stand against the
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, people already didn't
like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't going to hurt my reputation to
do this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice to be able to do it with
someone that had a good reputation
[SPEAKER_02]: already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's interesting in the sense that
the more I talk, like it's nice that
[SPEAKER_00]: there, I get people that, you know,
we've, Matt and I do get quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: nice messages about this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there also is resentment and anger
and hatred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we'll do an history episode and
you know, all of a sudden I'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: something or Matt will say something that
contradicts some narrative that somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else has and we don't even mention them by
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're pissed off because it,
it undermines what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things I would love to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even, even with my loose lips,
like as far as, uh, you know, talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about what I feel, feel like talking
about, there's a lot of things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody just asked, so who does right
now, if you want to, if you want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: any headband crosses from me, um,
uh, you can't, but, uh, I did share the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut with, uh, uh, with CJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: TSI and there's some really fucking good
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he released some TK and some Chem D
and people send me stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like those are both really nice
hybrids, especially the D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he'll probably be releasing some more
stuff in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm still on the fence about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, but you know, he has it
directly from me and I gave it to him so
[SPEAKER_00]: he could make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people could have a chance to grow some
hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's got a big reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, there's a,
there's a thing too, where Matt and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that probably within the next five
years, the seed market will probably
[SPEAKER_00]: shrink a lot and thus the breeders will
probably shrink a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say in the next six, six months,
we're going to see a drastic decline back
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it was, you know, maybe a few
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already see a lot of people starting
like opening up the vault and offering a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuff from their collection that
they're like, what the fuck am I going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody else wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can generate some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the amount of boats, RVs, various
things up here for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, the, the downturn in
cannabis right now has caused a fire sale
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst all sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has, you know, a fire sale of all
sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, um, you know, and so,
you know, there's part of the reason why,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there is a, a decent amount of my work
in modern things is because I was really
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid back when, uh, prices were high 20
years ago and I was growing seeds for me
[SPEAKER_00]: and friends on the side when everybody
else was just bumping out flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting high prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't that many people breeding
20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were in a perfect spot for
distribution in that area where people
[SPEAKER_02]: growing mass amounts of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as far as distribution,
as far as getting friends to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as making sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was a, it was a passion project,
money losing venture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as soon as the easy money goes out
of it, I anticipate most of the breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: that mostly just mashed together stuff via
reversals will go do something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, so, you know,
it'll probably shrink, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be a bunch of volume,
uh, shrinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the people that are passionate
about it will stay in it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have less options,
but you'll probably have better people to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy from overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when there was a, uh, not a big
like burst in the scene before cookies and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, when seeds were still kind of
small, there's probably 50 of us
[SPEAKER_02]: worldwide, you know, 2006 to 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are thousands and thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I hope it gets smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it was nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: People weren't as cutthroat, but I mean,
you know, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool seeing a lot of different
people's point of view though,
[SPEAKER_02]: like being able to see all the different,
um, crosses and stuff from all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different points of view is always cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that, that is neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to dissuade anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always say on the show and I say
in private too, when people ask me like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how should I focus on being a good
breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say like, you know,
try to breed things you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to like, I like, I like these things
from this plant and these things from this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if I cross them, could I get the
traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a both in a single plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I make weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like myself, you know, uh, people time,
please put the cookie lineage out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cookie thing is like, I don't know
when we'll get to the cookie thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that might be, that might be a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why, uh, Matt and I
started like, in the eighties with Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: and the city and the, and Karel and the
city club and all that is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, there was less people to get mad and
argue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start in the eighties and you go to
the nineties and there's only,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there's less humans that are
going to get mad at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only get Sam the skunk man mad at me
right now for, for what we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies is like trying to be a billion
dollar empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely positioning themselves
to sell out to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some huge corporation when it goes
federal, um, they have stores all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big into branding, um,
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to, you know, that's like
really poking the dragon, um, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't give a shit about the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the truth is irrelevant to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're building, they're trying to build
an enormous brand with stores all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: nation and clothing and all this different
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was footage of Bernard going
into city council meetings and talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the illegal burros in that city by
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, pissing people off who do shit like
that is not my bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they got, they've got, and you know,
they're backed by a lot of money and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I know that there's,
I know that, and it's not, that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: only reason I'm not going to do it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason is, is that,
uh, there's a lot of lying and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of stories to unravel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, I do try to,
when I talk to people to be pretty upfront
[SPEAKER_00]: about what we think we know for pretty
sure and what we are unsure of.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when everyone has a different story
and everyone's kind of a shady,
[SPEAKER_00]: shady liar and everyone has issues,
uh, you know, I know a lot that people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I don't think we, you know,
we're not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the full picture yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, as a result of that, we're
probably, you know, and since like Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: and I started way back, we've just barely
gotten to talking about the last 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, I still want to go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to go back and cover the
nineties forum era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that one episode, we kind of just
went on a tangent and that would be fun to
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, one of the, one of the,
one of the things talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we can tie this into provenance
or whatever, you know, and like strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history is like, as you know, cookies is a
good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Skittles is too,
and all these different things where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you have a loose association of
friends with no contracts and no
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a strain that comes out of their
little circle gets hella famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a grab of who does what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's four or five or six people
tightly involved in the cookie story
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like when it got famous,
forget about like how it got made or the
[SPEAKER_00]: various steps, but as far as like after it
started getting problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who gets what piece of the pie,
you know, same thing with, with Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles used to be, you know,
Tony Mendo and Fields and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and third gen Shiloh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, there was battles
over direction and this and that and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a split into, into two camps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, Shiloh and Brandon
didn't get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they split, uh, and so fame and
money has been the end of a lot of clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed friendships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause who owns it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who should profit off it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gets what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and look at burner, you know,
burner's the face of cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he promoted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great clothing guy though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He promoted and he's good at promoting and
he has the part and, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the guy that had the least to do
with it got to be the most famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Face of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people are, people are kind of
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people say nobody owns the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say someone just said nobody owns
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a lot of people that are going
to be trying to own plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You watch owning plants, trademarking
names, uh, trademarking strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic markers, all that different types
of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me, that's very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very complicated because I'm one of
those people who's like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to fucking deal with that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, but I'm going to be the one who
loses out in the end for not giving a
[SPEAKER_02]: shit, not wanting to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is, it's another catch 22 that like,
if I don't at least learn about it and how
[SPEAKER_02]: to protect myself, then I'm going to get
railed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an interview this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an interview this week about my,
my collection, you know, and a big time
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery that I won't name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, you know, I wanted to see what
they thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was their line of thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was their offer?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what was their, you know,
not like, like, is it good enough to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: out or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just like, you know,
thoughts on like how people are arranging
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of these things,
you know, a lot of these nurseries,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these rich people, it's like,
one of the things they don't have is they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the cuts and they don't
have the know-how.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all thought they could buy their
way into a clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marketing, you know, the lawyers,
the certifications, the licensing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the real estate, they got all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big thing where it's like,
it's almost like they're going around to
[SPEAKER_00]: desperate growers and be like,
do you know, um, do you want to license
[SPEAKER_00]: your shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but then it's like, who,
like for instance, like who licenses the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I'm serious, you know,
like Greg Staten Island, skunk VA,
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I see someone else, someone we've
never heard of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like how would you even,
how would, like, how would you even go for
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hate to break it to you,
but my grandfather is actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the king of dog, but he was elected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you, uh, you know,
secret societies, all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and all my secret societies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, but that, but that's,
that kind of stuff is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one thing if like, you want to
talk to a breeder and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fricking, uh, Fletcher wants to license
rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, he made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about every old cut that just
came out of the ether and got traded
[SPEAKER_00]: around?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that are going to be
attempting to lock those in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wondered why, um, Rob Clark's
name was associated with OG Kush on
[SPEAKER_02]: phylose over a tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys, you can look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like phylose exists in a different
form now, you know, and I saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's different, and you,
and you look and there's the, there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I love Rob Clark and his
contributions to cannabis, but he's on,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's on some suspect boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, of some, of some companies and
stuff like that, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, yeah, all these people who has a
claim to the stake and then when the,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then like, and then how much of that
stake and then whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, a lot of these people are
just trying to collect genetics and dangle
[SPEAKER_00]: money in front of you and not even money
for buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like money in the future, like,
like spot us to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we sell a bunch of them,
we'll give you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really we need to give us the
collection first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going on all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking for, uh, they're
looking for, they're looking for desperate
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and unfortunately for them,
and unfortunately for the scene,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't give a fuck if it's real or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want someone to tell them it's
real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's a big enough company that
proliferates more than any real cut ever
[SPEAKER_02]: would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how things change for good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when it first happened,
um, in the nineties, uh, strains got
[SPEAKER_00]: trademarked, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bought, I bought super skunk direct
from Neville, um, in the, in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the late nineties, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was called ultra skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, uh, since he owned super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They own the name, you know, um,
you know, a white widow is owned by
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, even though their breeder,
who, you know, Shanti left or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's like, they own it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like someone saying they own
breeder syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get the name, they get the name or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, so what's cool about history,
uh, in any case, not just weed history,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, humans aren't really that much
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by studying the past, you'll start to
see a lot of people, a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of similarities in, in the,
in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened in Amsterdam in the
nineties is happening again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you might even say, Arjun is,
is, is, you know, greenhouse was the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, rich backed by, backed by a
bunch of capital, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really connected backers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that type of stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there's big money behind all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like, just like the greenhouse
did when they went to South Africa and
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa, they got all their strings there
and it took out a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those heirloom lines,
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just talking to someone from South
Africa yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see burner going to Thailand and we're
going to see again in the next several
[SPEAKER_02]: years, those heirloom lines are going to
be gone and replaced by what is being
[SPEAKER_02]: pushed over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's being, what's selling best over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of, a lot of Morocco is
Dutch strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Jamaica has been replaced by fast
growing, uh, Dutch Dutch genetics in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff starts getting,
it starts getting pushed around and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, cookies doesn't even
grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a clothing company and a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just, they just,
uh, make arrangements with people to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: weed for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have their own branded bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They control the, they control the milars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They control the milars and the point of
sale and you're buying cookie from cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: store and burner was at the grand opening,
but they don't grow weed because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: too complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're a, they're a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back in the day, he said,
we aren't into genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I never forgotten that when they
started selling seeds, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but it's like, that's the,
you know, you can knock it, but obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he's in this for, you know,
reputation and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want, I probably should be too,
but you know, but it's like, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's like, you know,
there's, you know, there's, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing wrong with money and there's
nothing wrong with making a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like, some people
like, don't really give a shit at all
[SPEAKER_00]: about what they're involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to survive, you know,
and, uh, and, you know, so they're opening
[SPEAKER_00]: all these stores in these different places
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they have dozens of,
you know, they, they make contracts with
[SPEAKER_00]: dozens of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of brands don't grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most big famous brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that I'm not picking on cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most big famous Cali brands are not
vertically integrated and rarely grow
[SPEAKER_00]: their own work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they have one small grow that doesn't
fill their brand and they give clones to
[SPEAKER_00]: other growers to fill a brand and make the
markup on the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the brands are starting to
become more important than the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then when you're in a
situation where, uh, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I just started reading the comments
again and got totally distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in a situation where you,
uh, you know, you buy weed in my LARS and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't even see or smell it most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's just got a bunch of opaque art
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like a mystery bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, they licensed cuts and then
they, you know, and then are they even the
[SPEAKER_00]: real estate go cuts?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, you know, they have different
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even have like in-house
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have breeders they work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they worked with, uh, JBZ for a while
who also buys seeds from other people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, and you know, they work with
compound and they work, they, they farm
[SPEAKER_00]: out all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're always on the lookout for
different people that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like, well, you know,
you don't want to stand next to burner and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At openings and get more rep and get your
weed in the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to make sure it's clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that is farming out to people who
farm out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those weren't actual people making seeds
that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hired to make seeds and farmed
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's layers of farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's layers and there's, and you know,
there's layers, there's layers to all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I contract with you to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hire your friend to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's very, you know,
so there's an aspect where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, right now, like history is mostly
useful for marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be, Oh, he's cutting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be in a bad spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought we had him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while he's cutting out, I'll go over
this real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the show on our discord Patreon,
and it'll probably be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: an hour or two after we're going to pick
some people from a random drawing to
[SPEAKER_02]: receive the candle Bible collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that lucky person is also going to
receive a medium bottle of the right
[SPEAKER_02]: reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after the show, we'll be doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting the giveaway going for everyone on
the discord Patreon is a thank you for
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone who is participating in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tomorrow we've got some good fights to
watch too as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking forward to not so popping
back in eventually here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully probably got a phone call that
tends to kick us off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all mean with that wig check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all mean what else do I have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to join the breeder syndicate
Patreon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Google type in breeder syndicate
Patreon, and that's how you find us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for stopping in Stoney.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk to you after.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had very few technical
difficulties, relatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that wasn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blame it on Matt's headdress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my headdress did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow is yellow headdress or
something happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know where I necessarily got
cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I was trying to make the
point that history and history and
[SPEAKER_00]: provenance and like whose hands it went
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a core group of us that are really
interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of people that are
only interested in the marketing aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there might be a great amount of
interest in the public, about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that like that leads to
a bunch of people honestly trying to go
[SPEAKER_00]: forth and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rarely does that because it takes
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes money and time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Friendships, trust, respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be funny if we were talking
about the CFAM and I got cut off because
[SPEAKER_00]: like it triggered some algorithm that they
pay for, you know, and they were just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, no, no, cut the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the publicity that we're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'll mention something
about about about cookie just from like a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the, you know, I'll never have a
good a good collection of cookie cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's too many things to try to
hold on to already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't personally like most of them
very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you can't hold everything,
you know, because that's, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to pick and choose what
you personally enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be interesting now
because cookies is just old enough where
[SPEAKER_00]: people will start talking about like,
do you have the real forum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the real Oh nine animal?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that who's got the thin mint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got the and the and the the hands on
that is pretty terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that Amherst kind of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Amherst thing bugs the hell out of me
because I mean, that was like with the
[SPEAKER_00]: diesels and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was literally just something like
Mandel just decided to add on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I gave him cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden there's Amherst
sour diesel or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So animal animal is one of the better
ones, but mostly because it leans way more
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the more gassy animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the gas, the gas stuff tends to
have, you know, the problem is my my
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest issue with with with cookie,
you know, not to just diss the hell out of
[SPEAKER_00]: them or anything is that I think cookie
came out in this in this era where they
[SPEAKER_00]: got fucked hard, where IG happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So visually appealing weed was super
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And testing was starting to be super
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was probably good highs in the
in that weed that got sacrificed for
[SPEAKER_00]: better looking, better testing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they lost the high and they can't
get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how I see most of cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they were playing and they weren't
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what happens when you inbreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it really is what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what happened to blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needed some need some new juice needs
to be outcrossed to something completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and, you know, and so but
that's kind of like, like cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles and, you know, all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of like the start of what
maybe I would consider like modern
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and hyping and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that's where it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because before that, it's like so silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the previous era before that,
where like sour diesel was king,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody cared what cut of sour diesel you
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had to be gas and good weed and
so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this all this shit about like which
exact one it was was semi irrelevant when
[SPEAKER_00]: brokers were pounding on the door
demanding a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't matter if it was so much New
York City diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled like fucking great fruits and
perfume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they would, you know, like it just
went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like this massive thing of tracing
down sour lineage is almost kind of new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's newer, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's only been in the past like
decade that we've been able to kind of put
[SPEAKER_02]: it push everyone all together that was
involved with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with OG, same with this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the really quiet people were some
of the most important and only really
[SPEAKER_00]: started posting or talking or
communicating with people to spread their
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another issue with provenance
that we should mention is that often the
[SPEAKER_00]: first and the loudest and the most
consistent with their story gets their
[SPEAKER_00]: story out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might not and that might not
actually be accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they don't have anybody challenging
them from the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can stand uncontested for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like take for instance, you know,
there's multiple cuts that I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: really good cuts that are headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Matt and I consider to be OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all claimed every single one
is claimed to be original New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: From New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legendary one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just when the last year or so,
Manny and Swell and some others started
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what that cut looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out it was very Fox taily,
diesel-y looking skunky cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden people holding real
New York City headband guaranteed that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had 10 years of nobody was
contradicting them with their headband
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're like, well, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're a dick for bringing this
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a dick for bringing it up all over
again, even though all this is still out
[SPEAKER_02]: there to be read.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean the guy that had it named
it says this isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, funky headband in
upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two different headband cuts in
California, both of which I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice, that are very OG Kush-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very OG Kush-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smell or look or anything like the
guys from back in New York described the
[SPEAKER_00]: original headband that they grew as.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that took that only
happened within the last couple of years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get those quotes and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get those quotes and to get them to
confirm exactly what it was like and to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a small group of friends knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't something that was widely
disseminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when there's legends and there's
very little information on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: it allows a lot of people to just step in
and say, well, this is what's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, so there's an
aspect right there where provenance is
[SPEAKER_00]: only cared about by a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it use it for marketing or sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and then, you know,
once it becomes popular, it's like as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as it's as soon as all this stuff is
unpopular again, all the old stuff will go
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nobody will care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't take the magic power of a
Sharpie and a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot won't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, there's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's and, you know, one of the one
of the cool things, too, was even like on
[SPEAKER_00]: even on like our discords and stuff like
that, where Matt and a bunch of friends of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine gather when we started throwing those
parties around Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for a lot of us because a lot of us
were from different parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some of the first time that we got
to get together and actually smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: personal flower of each other's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put highs and flavors and visibility
to like what was just talking in pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also like this is for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, if you're going to go hang
out at one of these events, always
[SPEAKER_02]: remember to bring something cool and that
that doesn't suck because you're asked to
[SPEAKER_02]: get judged by what you bring no matter
what, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: The training is how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get judged.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a little advice for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it and, you know, that's the
other part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, you know, I saw this thing
where I grew, you know, our buddy Pipp
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me his version of the East Coast Sour
Diesel when I was doing my head to head to
[SPEAKER_00]: head to head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel comparisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew it in the sun and he came out
to one of our parties and he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my God, dude, I think I've only grown
it that nice twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I did anything
incredibly special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that the soil it was in in
the sun and the weather that year was
[SPEAKER_00]: nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just came out nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the diesels came out really,
really flavorful from that that year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that was a good year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a lot of good weed those
couple of those those few years before.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID ruined it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, but a lot of times it's
like you hear about a bunch of this weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and you but you it's not like everybody
gets to smoke it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, you know, CSI is sending me
and Matt, like dozens of samples all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time of all the things in his library to
peruse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't send you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weekly weekly week daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your daily just go check the PO box and
it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, daily daily supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfectly cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, there's people there's
there's people that that were that are
[SPEAKER_00]: that are asking, oh, you should release
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should you should this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a part where it's like so
maybe we'll maybe we'll throw out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of like soap box or pontificating here
for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I hold strains is basically
one reason I like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how a strain gets held by me for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also this thing where,
you know, it's like it's part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage and history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if enough people hold on to enough
strains that they like, then there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonably good chance that a bunch of
diversity survives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only so many people that are
willing to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're holding it, hoping that one
day it ends up being super valuable,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably be bitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we actually saw a case of this where
a friend at the time finally got a hold of
[SPEAKER_02]: an old cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he thought because he got a hold of
this old cut that it was going to make him
[SPEAKER_02]: rich and or famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't turn out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was going to be able to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was going to be various things
that happened with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was going to like unlock.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going to be leveling up,
leveling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't work, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you really loved it and it was just
about it, then that wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: mattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, none of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if I was trying to like
if I was trying to gain a bunch of rep
[SPEAKER_00]: from my seeds and a bunch of money from my
seeds, then like all my breeding is a
[SPEAKER_00]: total failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be so pissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody would be like,
oh, people stole it from me and did this
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, did that with it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your goal is to preserve it and you
want people to smoke better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the guy getting all pissed thinking
that, like, I'd be all pissed off because
[SPEAKER_00]: I was beating him to the punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I I want people to smoke better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think diesels and, you know,
and those kind of plants are better weed
[SPEAKER_00]: than a lot of what's been bred with in the
last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm happy that there's weed
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want good pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want good pot to use to make
better pot, to then make better pot than
[SPEAKER_02]: other people used to make better pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually everyone's going to forget
who the fuck you are.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're all nobody after 100 years,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even after 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Neville might be really famous,
but most of the stuff that he bred is bred
[SPEAKER_00]: into other things and his contribution and
name to it is lost, even though it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the backbone of a ton of stuff we
work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's famous to like a few of us nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's unfortunate because you should
have that that special place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all kinds of people that I'm
chatting about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, please, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this thing where you could be
cool and you could maybe offer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're a capitalistic sellout
piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the only people that are allowed to
be capitalistic sellout pieces of shit are
[SPEAKER_00]: people that actually are that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just immune from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just they're just like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I just proved you're exactly like
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people who are listening to this
probably are here because they like good
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's that's the weird
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, I don't have like,
you know, as Matt's well aware,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's good friends of ours in our
circle that have my strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they're good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not, you know, everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people would say, I'm using you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, there's there's there's
aspects to it, too, and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not even so much like you know,
life and covid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the end, really, that's what exactly
what would happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just you know, one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people don't believe that I actually
gave that cut to our homie to make hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: with just so more people could try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't get anything for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where like a lot of times people don't
understand that like for a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that hold cuts, they demand any other
breeder working with it, pay them
[SPEAKER_00]: royalties or give them seed or make some
kind of arrangement to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of like secret horse trading
that goes on for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people want to get in positions where
like they're the controller of the cut.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just gave it to him because he's my
good homie and I know he'll back it up for
[SPEAKER_00]: me and he won't pour it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, make as many hybrids as
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bunch of people are growing good
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that does that is that
beneficial to me?
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like not at least in a financial
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but but people can't conceive
that you would have something valuable and
[SPEAKER_00]: just share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you share all your vibrators.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel cool about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the it's the you know, once once
they're no longer good enough for me and I
[SPEAKER_02]: have to upgrade, you know, got to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's there's an aspect where
it's like I know the only reason why I
[SPEAKER_00]: threw that out there is because like,
isn't isn't for people to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, he should have done this or this
person should have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more that like, you know,
not everything has to be about money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like so there's nothing wrong
with selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anything inherently
wrong with selling clones or selling seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or selling good flour or like anything
like that, because it's like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trading on value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem becomes is that just because
of humans, a bunch of people are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: scam you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it's like, I don't know,
like, you know, I think I would like there
[SPEAKER_00]: to be better weed more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the current craze for the last
four or five years has led us kind of far
[SPEAKER_00]: away from better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice if better weed came back
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just got to get in the right circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the problem is that's exactly what
I'm talking about, where it's like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always in certain circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get the public to have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get more people to access it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get young people that listens
every week and loves our fucking show or
[SPEAKER_00]: something and they would die to try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nowhere for them to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a conundrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a conundrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because there's nice people,
you know, that are younger and into it and
[SPEAKER_00]: hyped up and would love to try these
different things that were talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like there's not an easy,
verifiable way to figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, though, but like I kind of look
at the Discord chat is a good way to meet
[SPEAKER_02]: the people like the next generation of
people that are really passionate about
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They shine through real obviously because
they're the ones who won't stop asking
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you use of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you see in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like most people think you would probably
get annoyed after a while, but nerding out
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, that is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People sharing all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the reason the reason why I know
that like people are finding a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool stuff in the L.A., L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: by D.
[SPEAKER_00]: is because people send me stuff and smoke
reports and pictures all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I spent last month smoking the what
was it, the L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cross to the Triangle, my buddy Space
Invader and King cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shit was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it's like it's it's there's
a way where how do you how do you figure
[SPEAKER_00]: that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this whole show was kind of based on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rambled a bit, but it's like
provenance ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How close clone trading started,
where it is right now, because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think five years ago,
people were offering up a bunch of clones
[SPEAKER_00]: on on IG very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just there's so many more and
there's so many more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to say they have X,
Y, Z rare cut because it just wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: people weren't as interested in X,
Y, Z rare cut from the 70s or 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just there is that demand now for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, yeah, now there's tons of new
people that are jumping in and they want
[SPEAKER_00]: access to all these various old things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's clone dealers that have,
you know, that are offering up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, wasn't there like some shit where
this guy raised like there was like one
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and eighty thousand dollars or
something from like RS 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sold like, you know, they sold
like a thousand dollars a cut or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and back in the O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush days, it's like, remember Rezen's
joke of two hundred fifty thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for the Louis the 13th O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was this one guy that had it
and it was like a marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, yeah, I had a dude that
told me that they paid fifty five thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars for the for a haze cut from
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were selling they were
selling a business in their regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were going to be able to grow that and
hustle it to a market.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fairness, that cut does have amazing
extracts that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I just mean the sense where
they're like, oh, you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow this and sell it to New York and
you're going to make X amount of money and
[SPEAKER_00]: da da da da da.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want this business and we have
it, you have to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's it's like this weird thing
of like, are you a hoarder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a share?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you how do you navigate that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we've been talking about a
bunch of stuff and we talk about pot that
[SPEAKER_00]: we love.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people ask us about pot that we
love.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's one dude said RS 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a million and it was dirty with
viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now people are popping up
with all kinds of crazy numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, of people selling access to
various clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we hear about it because people
messages are like, hey, should we trust
[SPEAKER_02]: this person?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I don't even like answering that
shit because it just makes more people mad
[SPEAKER_02]: when I answer that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's that I mean, it's it's
hard to because then it's like if you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you tell the truth and you're not very
trustworthy of that person's provenance,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they think you're pulling money out
of their wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pissed off at you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, people used to sell people
used to sell the Skittles, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people used to sell the OG, the sound like
it's it's it's ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been ongoing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just social media made it
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we've gone pretty heavily through
the provenance part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you want to talk any about any of
the new potential ideas that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably going to do the not so
story time finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can chat about we can chat about
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as people are may or may not be aware,
we have our we have our our discord back
[SPEAKER_00]: and our and, you know, various things and
and we've been putting a bunch of content,
[SPEAKER_00]: old content and some new content up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people to chat about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought rather than having like
these long winded rambling conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: every week that go in a million different
directions at times, we might be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do like some more focused stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times in the comments,
people ask to get hella focused on certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to go off on those tangents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're thinking about doing is
Matt's going to do some of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is not so story time,
as Matt likes to call it, where people get
[SPEAKER_00]: to listen to me ramble about various
stories or various historical bits or
[SPEAKER_00]: funny things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them might just be a five or 10
minute discourse on a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL one, NL five, this, that whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might just be like the collected
knowledge of this is what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because a lot of times people
ask us about stuff, too, and we've covered
[SPEAKER_00]: it on previous shows, but it might have
been a year ago, you know, halfway through
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it could be three years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was me doing it solo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's something me and not so
covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens all the time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, those things would go,
you know, and it would basically be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation starter and a place that
people could go listen to something for
[SPEAKER_00]: five or 10 or 15 minutes and sort of get
like, this is the best we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some educated guesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like strain history, story time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe a third thing that I've
been thinking about, which is like grow
[SPEAKER_00]: styles and, you know, and trade offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you trying to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that are that that are
trying to give grow knowledge or trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell a certain method or hydroponic
nutrients or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe whatever it might be nutrients,
amendments, biology, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to convince you that if you
just follow this path, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Christianity or whatever Buddhism,
you know, this will give you all the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And life is rarely like that with growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of trade offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so not every growing style
is suitable for every growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, every growing goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are asking if we have to change
anything with Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there is no new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do anything different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Discord, it kicks you automatically
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people that are already a part of it
are already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, you just go back to Patreon and
click connect to Discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disconnect and then hit connect and it'll
kick you into the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be a part of the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we now have three different levels for
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third one's a pretty cool one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go check that out, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically just like Matt and I
like taking full control over the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed partnerships are hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be very complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more complicated with two
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so, you know, there's people are
saying, oh, follow Lucas formula to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stuff is like how.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it'll be it'll be chats about
all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting, nutrient, greenhouses,
styles, trade offs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and some are going to be solo if not
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to hear me say,
yeah, every five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some are going to be solo with me to
where you might just fast forward the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we might even we might even have a
situation where people have been asking
[SPEAKER_00]: about like fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there might be there might be
some aspect of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: where did you really flail?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got plenty of stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got plenty of stories of that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that between that and just and friends
and seeing everyone everyone around me
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 25 years, you've seen lots of failure,
lots of mistakes.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, we're going to we're
going to be trying to be doing some like
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter and some more medium term content,
you know, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically just like trying to share
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, trying to share info.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're part of the Patreon discord,
like we have the five dollar, fifteen
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar and then the fifteen fifty dollar
one now.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the fifteen and fifty, we're doing like
small private group sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be trying to do that once a
month where me and not so sit down with
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe five people in a group and just
shoot the shit and get more personal than
[SPEAKER_02]: we ever can get in these larger groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask not so about all this dirty,
dirty, dirty sex nights like I do every
[SPEAKER_02]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt is it's hard for Matt to
think about much else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that it just goes right back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's mostly just trying to throw
me off whatever I'm talking about and
[SPEAKER_00]: having stutter and stumble while he
laughs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's uncrackable.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's uncrackable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm uncrackable or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, generally speaking,
ethics and cannabis is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providence is weird because we come from,
you know, a shady gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal, quasi legal, you know,
thing where it's basically just about your
[SPEAKER_00]: word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people were either there or
they weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so, you know, there's a lot we see
a lot of scams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways that Matt has become
so popular on Instagram and other
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms is by trying to expose said
scams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's more my my autism twinging,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just fucking drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so everybody that everybody
that he tries to expose ends up hating
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that trail gets longer and
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got an army like an art, an army of
haters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of their fans end up
becoming haters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we just want to give out
real information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, too, when it comes to the
story time or when it comes to strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history or whatever it might be,
people think that we might be threatened
[SPEAKER_00]: by better information that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or more information that adds levels of
detail or might change perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of all this stuff is to
start conversations and to start people
[SPEAKER_00]: chattering and to start thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people come out of the woodwork
with verifiable information that makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: history deeper and richer, like rather
than being insulted, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's to be, you know,
so some people come out and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, they're like, oh, you can prove I'm a
liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're trying to tell stories from an
inherently shadowy world where not
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone agrees and people argue about
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to give some form of
reliable history that's as close to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get as what you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there could have been somebody there
that adds an angle to it that you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of what history is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build on what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when something comes along to change
part of what you know, you add that into
[SPEAKER_00]: the fabric and keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than being discrediting,
it's like it's it's a it's a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like crowdsource information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at least how I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I definitely see it that way as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if info comes out, we end up being
wrong about something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd much rather correct myself and be
right to continue to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm much happier knowing more info.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's one of those things about
being a nerd.
[SPEAKER_02]: More info is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's counter to what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I understand what everybody
likes history until it bumps up against
[SPEAKER_00]: their prejudices.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, science, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like they prove something
and it goes against your religion or your
[SPEAKER_00]: belief set or your this or that or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
