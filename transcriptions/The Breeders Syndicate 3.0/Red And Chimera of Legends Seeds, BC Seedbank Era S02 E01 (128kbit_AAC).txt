[SPEAKER_04]: Ready, go!
[SPEAKER_04]: music music music music music music
Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, today we have here Kynera and
Rhett.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are founders, I can't even say
founders, I shouldn't say founders,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you guys kind of are of the BCC scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys were there in the early days of
the BCC scene and the BC cannabis era,
[SPEAKER_03]: the boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just wanted to sit back and kick
your brains on what you guys went through,
[SPEAKER_03]: the early upcomings and your guys'
adventures through your era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, thanks for having us on this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's an honor, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't even really know what to
say, man, BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up on the east side of the country
and I didn't meet Kip until the early part
[SPEAKER_00]: of like 2000s, I guess, really late 1990s,
late 1990s, early part of 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Canadian scene was really so
different back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was really segregated all
across the countries, different provinces
[SPEAKER_00]: treated cannabis quite differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: BC, kind of the left side of the country,
BC being the most lenient kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of different types of scenes
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back, for example, was like really
quite controlled or at least influenced by
[SPEAKER_00]: the health of the biker gangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't really as like open,
but I would say the west, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least starting in BC, it was really,
BC is such a massive province.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like four times the size of Germany
kind of thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only the population,
I guess, back then must have been around
[SPEAKER_00]: three million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only four million now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine like spaced population
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of places you can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of small towns, a lot of places to
go at the end of the road and set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: show or dig a bunch of trailers or eat the
ground or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people really did everything
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was so open, at least in
British Columbia, and anybody could get
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I think probably and one
of the reasons I think it was accepted as
[SPEAKER_00]: well is that like every family or every
person knew someone in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business, whether you were a grower,
a broker or a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like it is in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis scene feeds the local
economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the local economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives the local economy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without that local economy,
I mean, you're not going to have gas
[SPEAKER_00]: stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we got this town in the
interior British Columbia called Nelson,
[SPEAKER_00]: B.C., which became a little bit known in
the States about 15 years ago or 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember exactly when it was,
but they put up a statue to recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: draft dodgers that came up from the
States, like in the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because these guys would show up,
they'd dodge the draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd come up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't have a social security or
social insurance number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you couldn't you couldn't be part of
the regular workforce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these people, these guys would
start setting up drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're typically like hippie minded
folks anyway, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, you know, growing cannabis
really just fit in with that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it was, it was like the number of
car dealerships or high end restaurants in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nelson was like it's way, way,
way above normal populations because like
[SPEAKER_03]: people there have money to spend like
Miami during the 80s with the cocaine
[SPEAKER_03]: boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably a little bit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but Nelson's really like, I mean,
it's the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're on the other side of the
northern border from Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite remote, like in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's far in the interior.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like there's a big three lane
highway driving there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be like a less than an hour
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's it's really an interesting
little place that developed this this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I said, you know,
I mean, Fox News got all bent out of
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, obviously, when that statue went
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the kind of it's the kind of
place that would do that in support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, conscientious objectors were
usually kind of social misfits as as it
[SPEAKER_03]: were.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could definitely see that leading to
a growing community, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there so there was another community
like that on the east side of the country
[SPEAKER_00]: called Killaloo, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, there's Canadians that
are listening, but we've got this pastry
[SPEAKER_00]: they they make called Beaver Tales up here
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, they're from Killaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that those guys also came from
that same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have one of the Beaver Tales called
Killaloo Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I was often wondered if
that was, you know, money laundering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me if I'm totally way off base.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just, you know, like those were
the two those two communities on the West
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast and the East Coast that really,
you know, that really were made up of
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly draft dodgers or at least a
significant portion of draft draft
[SPEAKER_00]: dodgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they kind of became these cannabis
hubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, it's it's been a weird
transition in the last like really 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years to watch this whole thing develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what was your what was your
first entrance as far as like when you
[SPEAKER_03]: were when you first started smoking,
what were the strains that were around
[SPEAKER_03]: that you were running into that kind of
inspired you even to get into cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, when I was originally buying
dope, it never it didn't come with a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early on ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brick, just this brick, red hair,
purple hair, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that I went to the school
and down the road, the there's my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend ended up running into this guy
who's a real, real skid mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a real he just this weirdo that
was that sold drugs, I guess, to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the high school students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I remember buying weed from
him and he had what was what was referred
[SPEAKER_00]: to as BC skunk or the skunk weed or
whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was this had to be, you know,
early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, you know, it was just not like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just that was then it was the first
time I saw anything with a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I had this other dealer I
would typically buy from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had all these really nice import hashes
and different kinds of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was, you know, it would be like I'd
show up and he'd be like, oh, I got these
[SPEAKER_00]: purple buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like, you know,
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got like a red cherry honey oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the names that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't it wasn't like it wasn't
branded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't cultivar names or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think really that that probably
didn't actually start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that there was obviously
people that were going over to Holland and
[SPEAKER_00]: buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in Canada, there was no
legal seed sales until marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, there was no above the counter seed
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until Mark Emory started selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I remember seeing the first
copy of what became Cannabis Culture
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine was cannabis Canada magazine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a seed catalog on the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was really when I was
like a kind of, you know, open,
[SPEAKER_00]: not open my eyes, but like, you know,
I really sort of understand that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: this larger world of cannabis,
cannabis seed banks and types of
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all wasn't just weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's when you're buying from a
from a unregulated market where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just buying whatever the dealer can get
his hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, do you have something or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When shit can go dry, it's not a main
priority.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you got?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your first entrance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew up in southwestern Ontario back
in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we didn't see grass,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we saw a lot of hash oil,
which would be called RSO now,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And import that all came down from the St.
Lawrence from the rock machine and the
[SPEAKER_02]: bikers coming down that side of that
laneway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, honestly, dope to us was,
you know, a 15 dollar gram RSO two for
[SPEAKER_02]: twenty five or import a free hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until I, you know, I got out to,
you know, kind of dead tour, let's say
[SPEAKER_02]: late eighties, dead tour of the East Coast
and then ultimately made my way out to
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver to go to school at UBC that I
actually see flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be quite frank, I know a lot of guys
are in my area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back after I did, as it were,
I knew kind of more about growers in that
[SPEAKER_02]: scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of when I came back to visit from BC
and found out there were a lot of guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that were growing in the cornfields,
you know, especially the organic
[SPEAKER_02]: certification that always give you harvest
dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We said they were going to be harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd always go in, plant your weed
between the rows and then take it out at
[SPEAKER_02]: least two or three days before the guys
come get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you let the farmers do it for you back
in those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Southwestern Ontario in the late seventies
and eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, I kind of got out to BC
in 1991.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to UBC, did an undergrad degree
there and really kind of got immersed in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: The varieties of cannabis, the ease of it,
the acceptability of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I came from Ontario, man,
puffing a joint in public with
[SPEAKER_02]: sacrilegious, looking all around,
waiting to get popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we walked down the streets in van and
just didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one cared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just this freedom and this
wonderful culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I found myself in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really was exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, graduated among between
going to Grateful Dead shows, somehow
[SPEAKER_02]: graduated and really, you know,
just got into the scene very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew a lot of folks that were moving a
lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of stuff was going down south,
obviously, back in those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis culture scene on East
Hastings, which would have involved Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: Emory's hemp BC, which became cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blunt Brothers with Darryl, the Amazon
Cafe, or the Amazon, sorry, the Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_02]: Cafe with Karen Dunlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was a whole scene down
there, man, like in one of the shittiest
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of town anywhere in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had this real big pot block where you
could go down, puff in cafes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cops weren't going to come bust you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out with like-minded people,
really start making connections and
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding you weren't, you know,
this individual you were part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: A larger community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really dope, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of then that we started kind
of figuring out like the boards,
[SPEAKER_02]: the forums, you know, like Cannabis World,
Heaven's Stairway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm going way back now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old Crow, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they expanded this community that
wasn't just in Vann, but it was North
[SPEAKER_02]: American, especially our Yankee brothers
and sisters down south.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that were, you know, you guys
would do jail time for a joint where if we
[SPEAKER_02]: get, you know, white privileged up our ass
up here and get a slap on the wrist and
[SPEAKER_02]: told to go home, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were the kind of, that was kind
of my first introduction into the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: the more global or North American scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we quickly realized, you know,
starting up small grows in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was easy peasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the worst thing if you got busted
was you would get told to go sit out
[SPEAKER_02]: front, they'd chop your plants,
take your ballasts and that was it,
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Restart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having three or four houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, rent was cheap back in Vann in
those days too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, and pounds were going for 32
Canadian at that point in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was well worth that an eight
lighter could put you in a new tax
[SPEAKER_02]: bracket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we figured out pretty quickly that,
you know, you get to grow sensi or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that was great and fantastic
and get cuts from, you know, guys you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: meet online or seeds from Amsterdam and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could start making your own seeds
because there was this huge market for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, one room of making seeds was
like, five years of profits in sensi,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's really true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we kind of started doing
that, you know, and we started creating
[SPEAKER_02]: some seed companies and realizing that
there were other seed companies across
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an old business partner in mine started
Legend Seeds as a seed brokerage house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started carrying the Dutch stuff
and Canadian seed breeders at that point
[SPEAKER_02]: in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, I mean, I think there were
maybe six seed companies on the world wide
[SPEAKER_02]: web.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and most of them were Dutch or Mark,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, that's kind of my first,
but that's how it kind of got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'd had to Amsterdam once a
year, grab the seeds we needed to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, somehow they magically appeared
back in Vancouver and we sold worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took out ads in the back of high times
and we're one in a hundred got seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, really that kind of blew up for
me personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how I met Chimera to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I met him and was it Heaven
Stairway or Overgrow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not cannabis culture,
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis world, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was those guys out of Quebec.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I was selling Mila's isolator
bags back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually one of those moments where
I was like, I realized that my internet
[SPEAKER_00]: security wasn't great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had made a post online about the
needed some bubble bags from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend Marcus Richardson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I guess he read had been selling
them in Canada, a different brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mila, the pollinator company bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going into my university email
account and there was an email from red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I posted on this website and
now this guy has my email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see, that was the part of the
problem back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never felt like we were doing anything
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, my security especially living in
BC, because we just didn't think that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were untouchable, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just normal and I was going to act
like it was normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep forgetting that my Eastern
brothers were still getting pretty dodged
[SPEAKER_02]: out by shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back at it, it was an insane level
of security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of just what you learn
to operate under when you're operating
[SPEAKER_00]: under these harsh laws, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was in Ottawa, which is,
you know, think North of Utica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffalo kind of up that way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, it's the capital of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's where they decree the law
from, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they talk about federal law in
Canada, it's really enforced differently
[SPEAKER_00]: in the capital than it is kind of in the
West Coast, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the West Coast, you know, it is
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like you look back at DC and
be like, oh, those groups back in DC are
[SPEAKER_00]: making laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll go on about our lives here on
the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the same thing, but they
really do enforce it differently back
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, you're, you know, you're
ducking and covering while Kip was feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: secure and his little eight in his is
grows out on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was panicking my ass off every
time it started to smell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't much different in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even today, there's still like I live in
Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you drive six hours north to
Humboldt or seven hours north to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like totally different world night and
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pretty much it was up until
most recently, to be quite frank,
[SPEAKER_02]: even with legalization, things haven't
really changed that much until the last,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, five years of wreck legalization up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Attitudes generally, I mean, much more
conservative out in the East Coast and
[SPEAKER_02]: central Canada than it is on the West
Coast, which I mean, North America in
[SPEAKER_02]: general, I could probably say.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the great story was that how we
actually met Ryan was I convinced him that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I wanted to meet him face to
face and my partner at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: Karen Dunlap, who owns Amsterdam Seed
Company and Great Canadian Seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another friend of mine, Pete Young,
who actually is one of the founders of
[SPEAKER_02]: Endiva.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's also, you know, super cropping,
super cropping, you know, good friends
[SPEAKER_03]: with Pete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in, I grew up in London.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like a 14 year old kid when Pete
and Chris Clay were doing their whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was kind of born in that scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we interviewed Pete already.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding me, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're from London.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you from London?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of OK, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were born in London.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about that town like I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I like I went on I went on kind
of tours after the dead, but I was on like
[SPEAKER_01]: fish and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I swear I would I would go like
anywhere I went in the US, I would meet
[SPEAKER_01]: some fucking weirdo from London that,
you know, it's just like a weird
[SPEAKER_01]: connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite, my very first time I met Mark
Emory was when I was 16 by my two live
[SPEAKER_02]: crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned 50 this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't look it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you don't look it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 43.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I was buying records in City
Lights and same thing, two live crew and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that strip there with what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Richmond?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the the clothing store next to
Lehman House.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like City Lights, Lehman House and then
Pete's shop across the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like organic traveler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, organic traveler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Pete and I actually met over in in
Europe in Switzerland when we were doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: grow out tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: There at one point, we became very,
very good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the three of us hit the road
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we traveled all around Ontario and
Quebec and went to head shops back in
[SPEAKER_02]: those in the second year.
[SPEAKER_02]: What year was this, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this like 02, 01?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, so you and I had actually met
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't remember what year that
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been 2002 or 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my apologies, partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was it would have been 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been 2000 because she
wrapped my seeds over in Europe later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went and we were going to all these
head shops and we were trying to get them
[SPEAKER_02]: to sell seeds or at least carry catalogs
so that and we would kick down all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the owners that they handed out
our catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got to meet a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of our stops was in Ottawa
with with Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first time I somehow
convinced them to let us sell the seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that how it worked?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were you and I were already doing
business at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karen picked up the distribution account
at that point in time, the wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first time we met was the Jazz Fest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, mind blowing right in Montreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's been many heady years
ahead of me or behind you, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jazz Fest.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad had a place, Cary St. Louis,
Brownstone in Montreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: For years and we kick him and his family
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me and my friends would take over as
Brownstone for Jazz Fest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I met Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bubble Man was at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on that trip, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did we see?
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a bunch of great bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: MMW.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Karl Laswell and 8Track with the drummer
from Napalm Death.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a craze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a wacky show, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, those those are the kind of the
start days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, from there,
you know, my company legends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and Ryan would come.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd go over the high times, Cannabis Cup
in Amsterdam every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first booth was was literally like a
small table with a bunch of T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second year, we actually got
a real booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second year, we were actually
right beside that bubble, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had our booze right beside each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did fairly well there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to really connect with all the
Dutch guys like Ari and the drunkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, all the boys over there and
they became kindred friends, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we were these, you know,
cannabis cowboys from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys are the old Dutch guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were kind of showing us the
ropes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were kind of the new upstarts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really I got to be honest with you
that a lot of them were really generous
[SPEAKER_02]: with their time and their information and
were really quite friendly to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, too, Canada was kind of like
the leading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say BC was the leading edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pre pre pre prop 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were still clapping down on
everybody.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Vancouver was this little scene where
the American growers come up, get their
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really, you know,
Vancouver was the hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the Dutch folks really saw that
Canada was kind of the leading edge of a
[SPEAKER_00]: new territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, they wanted to have their
seeds in that new territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was it was their input to North
America, really, even to the US scene by
[SPEAKER_03]: by people traveling up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much easier to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to Canada than obviously
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And male, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's people that are
comfortable coming up and bringing the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was the mail order guys
that get them and people come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: ship them themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, oh, yeah, like the seed
scene down in on Hastings Street,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially at Mark's at MPC or Cannabis
Culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on Saturdays, man, the Yankee lineup
was out the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people come and buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, back then, you know,
Mark would owe us all these seed
[SPEAKER_02]: producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd give us his money and he'd give us
his card.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the back of the card, it said,
I owe you five hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every Saturday, you can come down and
pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, there'd be like six seed
guys on a couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all waiting for the next Yank to
throw the money down so we could get cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was we were just wholly
frightened by.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so sketchy down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was so much dodging that's going on
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was the only way we could get paid
back in those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, you know, again, met a lot of
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent a lot of money down there and
made a lot of great connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was a trip being a part of
that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, my favorite part of that scene
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ryan, I mean, did you spend a lot of
time at Blunt Brothers, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did love it at Blunt Brothers when I
moved out there for UBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stayed away from Mark Emery because I
just thought he was such a crazy guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your personal opinion, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first moved to Vancouver,
a friend of mine flew me out from London,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a room in the old Crosstown
traffic building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was sketchy as fuck in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I lived in that area for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've seen some shit then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I wanted to ask you guys some
questions, because like back then for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is like, I would say, 98.
[SPEAKER_01]: To like 2000, maybe the Tex-Aida time warp
was pretty huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had friends on the island there that
were always hooking me up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is that still kicking or like are
those people still doing stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I recently in the last six years spent
two years living in Gillies Bay on
[SPEAKER_02]: Tex-Aida Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent two years in Powell River as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing on Tex-Aida, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can let you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unequivocably, this is a true story
because I met the folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a family, essentially,
in the 70s that had the original cut,
[SPEAKER_02]: 79.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that cut was pretty much kept or
passed down or IBL'd, to be quite frank,
[SPEAKER_02]: up until about late 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was other cuts that were
just called time warp because you could
[SPEAKER_02]: get the money from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the original family still lives on the
island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third generation pop farmer is still
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original has been lost for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is of that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now like pine warp, pine berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of really classic
cultivars that come out of that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I mean, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tex-Aida is just one of these wacky
places, man, that just exists in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really don't believe it until you
actually see it for yourself, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two cops on the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived on Salt Spring Island for a
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't have cops at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have cops show up on a Tuesday
and they drive around the island and they
[SPEAKER_01]: leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, the mentality is if
you're not hurting another person,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a peyote church there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of shit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was just like complete freedom
on those islands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gulf Islands are unique and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing place to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in those days, too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The early 90s, Luskini was like they were
tons of dope off Luskini.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're known for having like the
mighty might, the Luskini mighty might.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Norm from Arthrology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're going way back now,
but there was a kind of a dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: called Arthrology before there were
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy named Norm from Luskini
Island, he was one of the guys that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of started this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, he came out and told everybody in
High Times magazine, we're about Luskini
[SPEAKER_02]: and goddamn the next season, the whole
thing was raided by the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never saw Norm back in the scene after
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shockingly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had some, but I'd heard of
Luskini way earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I had a friend that was out
working at a ski or a hiking cottage,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a helicopter and hiking cottage kind
of thing in the middle of Alberta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me some bud back that one of
his buddies from Luskini had brought out
[SPEAKER_00]: and he called it Luskini Sweetie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was some of the strongest herb that
I'd smoked when I was like one of my last
[SPEAKER_00]: years of high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really fucking potent dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's man, the weather patterns around
those two islands, Luskini and Texada are
[SPEAKER_02]: their own weather patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get away with going deep into late
September, early October without the rain
[SPEAKER_02]: melting everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just quite frankly,
there's not resources anymore for people
[SPEAKER_02]: to be busting or back then there wasn't
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they got a little crazy with the
helicopters a couple of years when we had
[SPEAKER_02]: some conservative governments in,
but it was just freedom, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could get good money for poundage
back in those days for outdoor dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can't give away outdoor now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were American choppers back then
though, in like the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 94 to 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like the black coppers,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to jump around a little bit,
but I'm going to go back to the pot block
[SPEAKER_02]: for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Mark got busted.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during that time on the pot block,
a lot of movie scenes sets would set up on
[SPEAKER_02]: that pot block all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you see a down and dirty back
alley, it's, it's, it's right behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: East Hastings alley near Cambie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's in every goddamn movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were just used to it being shut
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had, my seat office was about two
buildings down from, from cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had an office there, you know,
with an administrative assistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we shipped everything out
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a parking spot right in the
back, right beside cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid two dollars five bucks a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people wouldn't piss on my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best five bucks I ever spent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anyways, I'm just driving down
there one day and I see, I see a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of like DEA jackets and guys with
Bella Calavas and, and then there's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, barriers up and I'm like,
Oh Christ, man, are they fucking filming
[SPEAKER_02]: again?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the kids who used to work at
cannabis culture, Sean, he comes ripping
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, Kip, get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, this is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are there Bella Calava DEA agents
taking away a Canadian citizen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was ludicrous, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the party was over after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were so, felt so free and so,
you know, wonderful about what we had done
[SPEAKER_02]: and quite entitled to be quite frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that our government was going
to allow foreign governments, police force
[SPEAKER_02]: to come up and arrest the Canadian
national for something that the Canadians
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves wouldn't bust them on was
abhorrent and insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if he was a shitbag, Yeah,
even if he was a shitbag, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the, it's not the point,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But what he is personally, what he was
doing, he shouldn't have been arrested
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it was about 10,000 other things
he could have been arrested for,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I remember, Ryan,
were you part of that at that point when
[SPEAKER_02]: we all got together at John's?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was up island with DJ on that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I remember I was right at that
moment that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he called me pretty much right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was sitting around with,
funnily enough, Charles Scott and DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, everybody's favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was, that was a bizarre thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were invited to go up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dan and I drove up and, and spent the
night in the teepee up there, but it just
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to be that very day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember all three of our phones
rang within like 30 seconds of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was someone, some person in the
community, Mark's getting arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we were with Charles and he
was, you know, selling stuff down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: States at that point in time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we wanted to make a pretty
hasty retreat from there because we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that that place might be next,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as Mark was the largest meat seller
in North America at the time, our company
[SPEAKER_02]: was number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were genuinely freaked out at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a number of us that were in the
cannabis community, the owners of Blum
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers, Karen Watts and myself,
another couple of key big growers in town
[SPEAKER_02]: that all ended up at John Conroy's farm,
a very famous cannabis lawyer in many
[SPEAKER_02]: constitutional, one many constitutional
challenges in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all of us sitting there and
John's is like doing triage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all freaked out and John's kind of
trying to talk us down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember one of us saying,
well, I wish they would have just given us
[SPEAKER_02]: a heads up, you know, before they did
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And John looks at us all.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, they just did asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, funnily enough too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, another thing that was just a
weird bizarre coincidence was that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes and the High Times crew
had been up filming this B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud video, High Times B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud video, you know, when George used to
dress up in the in the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so another set of business friends of
ours had bought the bank across the street
[SPEAKER_00]: from Mark Emory's shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this two story old,
like, you know, early 1900s built bank
[SPEAKER_00]: with a vault and they were going to turn
it into a club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as that was like the process was
coming together and they were raising
[SPEAKER_00]: money to get the club together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sitting empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So George and Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: built a grow room in this bank across the
street from fucking Emory or from Emory's
[SPEAKER_00]: shop, just as some we could use as a
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can film this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was never going to get lit up in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, you know, we built it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the video, you can show this is how
to build a grow room kind of thing.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little do we know, the D.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: are all over the fucking block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I'm pulling up in my in my
Explorer and unloading all this grow
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and the D.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: are staking it like they literally hit the
hit the hit the store across the street
[SPEAKER_00]: like two days later.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a crazy times, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it definitely kind of was an end of
an era, to be quite frank, when when when
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark got popped and then Blum Brothers
burnt down like all within a matter of six
[SPEAKER_02]: months of happening that basically the
block the pot blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was done and no one felt safe
down there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of the gangs had kind of
taken over the street level cannabis trade
[SPEAKER_02]: and weren't making it as safe as it used
to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, just quite frankly,
everyone kind of went their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at that point, Ryan,
you've been living in van for how long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it must have been like two thousand
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, just a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we my partner, Karen
Watson, was still running the sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: sisters kind sanctuary, which was a pot
bed and breakfast, which was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just having Yanks come up and and letting
them be so free and watching the stress
[SPEAKER_02]: melt off their face when, like,
as soon as they got to the place,
[SPEAKER_02]: like an in-house dealer came in and asked
them what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd meet them for seeds and and
then they would have all these just hang
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the beach and go down the pot
block.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was kind of closing up at
that point in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we were still running
legends, but I was, you know, it was
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a little long in the tooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was not really I was tired of
looking over my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up opening up a store called High
End and it was right in Kitsilano.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of it was called Cannabis
Couture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was maybe a little far ahead of its
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had like five thousand dollar Jason Lee
pieces in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to be a super rich,
like cannabis hippie to come into our
[SPEAKER_02]: store.
[SPEAKER_03]: A cannabis nerd on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little cannabis nerd, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were selling the very first
volcanoes out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had bamboo clothing, organic
clothing, but we were selling seeds out of
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a pizza hut right across the
goddamn street.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was these two undercovers that
would just sit there and take pictures of
[SPEAKER_02]: us like every day for months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get followed home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we trash and burner phones
every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at my partner at one point in
the game and I was just like, I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to do this anymore, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just stressing me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of met the woman I end up
marrying and having a child with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know what,
man, I think I'm just going to tap out
[SPEAKER_02]: because the Harper was in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things were not happening on the scene in
the scene anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting tired of getting followed
home every night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sold I ended up selling legends to a
bunch of kids who ran it into the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: within about four months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I basically took a bit of a break
from cannabis for about seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I got into the wine business and
did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until my brother in law kind
of got me back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about six years ago that I kind of
came back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess that one big piece,
I guess we're missing is that piece where
[SPEAKER_02]: we we work with the DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was kind of happening just 2002,
2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had met Dan years previous in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was up through a mutual business
partner, a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously knew about blueberry
flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the guy was a bloody legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only was he a legend, but one of the
kindest, most giving human beings you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: ever meet his time, his information,
his ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd listen like he wasn't there to tell
you about what he's done in his life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was there to we want to genuinely know
about you, what your scene was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and then, you know, I knew for years
and I learned new shit about him all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time because he kept his cards pretty
close to his chest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyways, you know, he we'd we'd met
when we were over in Switzerland together.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came out and visited us over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We developed this great relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he turned to me once said,
you know, it's time for me to make some
[SPEAKER_02]: new seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were really lucky enough,
my crew and myself to be the recipients of
[SPEAKER_02]: that contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up making his next his first
batch of seeds that had been released in
[SPEAKER_02]: like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the true blueberry,
the Floatica.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chocolate one, Coco Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that would have been his release.
[SPEAKER_02]: The release that happened after our
release.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably about six or seven years
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else we had in the Grape
Crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Float routine and Grape Crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Grape Crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the one offs that I did for
Legends back then, too, which would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been the high end, which was the Rene
Cross with the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always chased that and could never find
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was rather you and me both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got 30 of those in the
collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was one of the things I would always
do when I was dealing with business with
[SPEAKER_00]: these folks is is dealing with the
wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always just trade for stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I obviously sell some stock,
but, you know, it was always about
[SPEAKER_00]: buffering the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time that I heard any of this,
like, for example, when Federation I heard
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were going out of business from
the seed supplier, I just traded them a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch and collected all their old stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I've got all those early Legends
releases as long as as well as the same
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that we ended up making at the same
growth for with with my joint projects
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the Mental Floss and Fighting
Buddha and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, guys, some of the greatest advice
I ever got from John Conroy, our lawyer,
[SPEAKER_02]: as he said, say, give me one set of
advice, a bit of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny's like, well, just grow west of
Granville, Kip, because they don't bust
[SPEAKER_02]: rich people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this house that Ryan's talking about
was literally one of the richest parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: town in this old house that was overseas
landlords, big old house.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we had like NHL hockey players
like right beside us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little did anyone know that we were
banging out a ten lighter out of there for
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many famous seed crops came out of
that that basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, like the Louie, we did another
batch of Louie out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we do out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan's a blaze.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Johnny Blaze was out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm close to my heart because that
was a Neville's Hayes that I was given by
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari and from Greenhouse Seeds out of his
personal collection in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were the same batch that he had
done some breeding with for Greenhouse as
[SPEAKER_02]: well that were given to him by Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was like right around the time
he was starting that seed bag or he was I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, he claims he was going on forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, that was the start of the
greenhouse seed bag shanty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he'd even set up and switch
one at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he just said because he was down
valley from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in Lugano and he was closer
towards the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott is a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so happy and thrilled that he's
actually still in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got to meet Howard Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's such a great man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to meet Howard in Berlin at a
cannabis conference back in those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's everything you'd want him to be
just a drunken Welshman with smiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really hard to understand him
as he got drunker, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Jackson's rough, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of smiled and nodded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this great picture of us in a field
in Switzerland that we camped on for
[SPEAKER_02]: months with a big ball of hash and reading
for the first time ever, Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got a chance to meet him two
months after initially reading the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's wild, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was definitely a bucket list
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the movie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, which one?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called it's called Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I think it was done in the 2000s at
some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good, but it's nothing compared to
the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not much stuff in the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, the book's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have one written by his wife as
well, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she did her whole side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't too thrilled about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always another side of the story,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did J.D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Short go out to Switzerland with you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he I had come back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did kind of two tours in Switzerland
after my second, my first tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, DJ's kid came out and did a couple
of weeks there, I believe, maybe two to
[SPEAKER_02]: four weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he did there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember because he he he was the kid
that broke my the pipe that won a medal at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cup, the cannabis cup, this like
beautiful four thousand dollars,
[SPEAKER_02]: any piece from shockwave glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, he was the kid that broke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never forget that for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had a chance to meet him,
kind of like shifts passing in the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen Deeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last time I thought that Deeds
was probably seven years ago by email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were all really, really close for
a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know how life gets that life
takes you on different journeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, DJ was trying to move up to Canada
during all that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and his his lady of the time at the
time were trying to actually emigrate to
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: They lived in the porn palace.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This beautiful penthouse in this four
story walk up that had an elevator right
[SPEAKER_02]: to the bar that that's where your front
door was shag carpet like gold inset and
[SPEAKER_02]: laid mirrored walls everywhere like sweet
out the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Karen Watson actually lived there for a
while and then she moved out from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam and then she moved out in Deeds
and Carla, his then wife, moved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many nitrous tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place was a lot of memories lost in
that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to UBC at the time and I
was living on the west side and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: just around not too too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was about like a two and a half
block walk from DJ's place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent a lot of time over there on the
weekends just hanging out chatting and
[SPEAKER_00]: learning about Dan's experience with drugs
and psychedelics and all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Scooby snacks, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were everywhere with snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like they're like a blend of
mushroom and natural, natural mushroomy
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of psychedelic mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came in capsules, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like came in cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that light brown, light brown
powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So OK, so what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a spirulina, ginseng,
chisandra, bee pollen, fo tooting and one
[SPEAKER_02]: point three grams of kibensis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hippie dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hippie dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the six caps, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could you could do a couple of caps
or one cap or you could do them all if you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted the full.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually, man, so in my shop,
I'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't give a rat's ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to sell them out of the shop to
friends and family.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to make cards and you get stamped
for every pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get stamped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you got 10, you got a free pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we do is if you wanted your
friends to be able to buy them,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had to sign the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to sign in the back of their card.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a mutual responsibility zone going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes Friday nights, it wouldn't be
anybody in the store all day, but as soon
[SPEAKER_02]: as Friday at five, the place would be
packed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can we talk about some of your guys's
favorite work that you've released over
[SPEAKER_03]: the years, your favorite, maybe favorite
to you, not necessarily high, but your
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite experience when working a line.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would that be for you, Red?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you know, I got to be honest with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, probably growing sense up in the
caribou with Ryan was there and our
[SPEAKER_02]: friend, the cannabis cowboy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were doing shade cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tunnel crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'd get about three harvests out
in the seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always, we always be done and out
before Labor Day, before the helicopters
[SPEAKER_02]: started buzzing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, and plus it'd be so dry back that
time of year that back in the day when
[SPEAKER_02]: things got dry that you get a dollar for
your gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were doing these shade crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of like greenhouse though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but we could pass it off as like
high, high end B indoor and get money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, I learned so much just being out
in the, you know, up in the plateau at
[SPEAKER_02]: 5,000 feet elevation sun beating down on
us in the middle of bloody nowhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: bears chasing us, cattle ranch,
walking over a cattle rock, walking over
[SPEAKER_02]: our damn pits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a, the telus blimp one day flew
like 50 feet over our heads and of course
[SPEAKER_02]: just freaking us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just drinking beers, eating good food,
telling lies, growing dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a lot of fun, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, as far as that did my heart
warm, that was my favorite part because
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else I did was very stressful,
but I felt safe there and it was with good
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I still liked trimmers
back then, you know, something was okay to
[SPEAKER_02]: hang out with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and just learning about people's
experiences with the plant, how they came
[SPEAKER_02]: to be in this crazy place where we were
trimming up to three, two or 300 pounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: dope in a season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my, my, my, one of my funnest
events with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've had a lot of really unique
experiences and a lot of very stressful
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences because of the timeframe that
my kind of life was in this, in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said that was probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, you got to love everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always say when people ask me
what's your favorite cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like, it's like children,
you know, they become like, so you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: love them all for a different reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for me, it's just always
screening, you know, the screening and
[SPEAKER_00]: the, and looking to see what, what the
process did and try to understand like the
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns of inheritance and, you know,
getting to explore nutrients that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I got this one girl going on
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a sour diesel sweet skunk
screen of like 150 seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, sour diesel, like the ECSD
cut is all fuel, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the first time that I've
really grown these ones out large
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, it's just like that, that nose
profile from the sour D just got stomped
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, like you think that fueliness
was just dominant over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and, you know, I've seen it a few
times, like you get the surprise a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times and you make a cross and it just
comes out completely unexpected to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But within that, there's always these new
interesting nose profiles, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's a combination of esters
and turps or whatever, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's some really interesting
sense in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's kind of always been my,
you know, favorite thing is, is doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a totally different
experience having the lab to lay on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: that too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you can just, the gains that
you can make when you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical fingerprints, both cannabinoids
and terpenes of the plants that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: mating together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's one step I've never taken,
including lab results and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: while you're doing the breeding and going
through the progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and you know, when you do it,
you can kind of do it when you're doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a female or females, you can kind of
do it with your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we were obviously, when we were
using males in the past, you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hit and blind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're waiting to see if the progeny
carried on the traits you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, you got to start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and often even trying to evaluate
like a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plants don't really demonstrate
those traits anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just more logical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a guess at that too,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done all sorts of things like
trying to spray ethafon on the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get them to produce female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, ethafon also changes the
terpene profile as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, it's a hint at what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the smallest glimpse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't know if it's going to breed
true for that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the whole thing is that even
when you do have the fingerprint in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, like, you know, say you've got one,
you've got three plants that all look the
[SPEAKER_00]: same in the, or they look almost the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell almost the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's call them plants one,
two, and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross plant one to plant two and plant
one to plant three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant two to plant three, and you grow
them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually realize that even though
all those plants, they look the same and
[SPEAKER_00]: they smell the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them had genes from another smell
and look, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one cross, they don't end up looking
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like, you know, if they cross two
to one, they all look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell the same, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can, you know, genotype can
essentially hide behind chemo type,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But chemo type is a good predictor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, but yeah, when you breed chemo
type to chemo type, the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between, you know, crossing a blind male
to a chemo type is just night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really can start stabilizing
things and making your seed lots that
[SPEAKER_00]: more, not much more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking expensive, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing that's precluded me
from doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, and even if you do it
in-house and you can get your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your consumables costs down to say like
25, 30 bucks a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want to run a thousand
plants, that's fucking $25,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a serious project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's probably more than the weed is
worth from the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's a hard thing to justify
to be able to do, but when you do do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gains are undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what's going to have to happen
moving forward in the Canadian scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: If these companies don't start putting
money into R and D and really starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the same five plate flavor
profiles that like are prodigious
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the entire goddamn ministry up
here in Canada right now, then we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doomed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the smarter companies are
starting to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really, I really hope that to be
true as well, to be quite frank,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm tired of smoking the same old
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I push this, push that,
cookie this, cookie that, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, you know, I think the States
has always been a little more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: than Canada has in that, you know,
and I think that the real reason is you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys have a client base or a market or
consumer base that's willing to spend 500
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some places for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places, you know, I mean,
New York used to be like $7,000 a pound
[SPEAKER_00]: for Saturdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was a period of time,
but you'd never get that kind of money in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But people just couldn't afford,
wouldn't pay that kind of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you, when you do spend that kind
of money, it allows you to put all those
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, beautiful finishing touches and grow
the small yielding varieties with the
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will be interesting to see like
which mistakes the, the developing legal
[SPEAKER_00]: market follows, like in the same way that
we did in Canada, you know, like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pub co-ification, like this big,
these big corporate companies coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to take over the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the same view of the
marketplace, the way that the consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think markets in California,
they're going to be able to maintain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of these less developed markets
as they come online, I think that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to suffer a lot of the same,
the same places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the government's, you know,
they don't want to give out a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to give out two, three licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you only have to monitor a few
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if all those groups are like big
corporate dudes that are just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: pump out like a million square feet of
flour, your quality is gone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like, you can't do that much
bulk and maintain the level of bulk that
[SPEAKER_00]: you expect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed a lot of these companies,
the major corporate companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're coming into a market that they
just clearly don't understand and they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't understand the characters in the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually the first people that they run
into are the people that have also no
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of the market, but they sell
themselves as that, you know, premier
[SPEAKER_03]: master breeder grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's been a big problem in
the U S is that most of these big
[SPEAKER_03]: corporations hire whoever comes first,
uh, with the best sales pitch and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and anybody that they end up hiring after
usually has to clean up the mess of the
[SPEAKER_03]: first one, which is a double task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, man, you speak in my language.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew some of the messes that had to be
cleaned up up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really like, you know,
you, you sure there's a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have made money, but there's a lot of
people that have lost their shirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, investors going in with the
wrong grower or, you know, I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a tour in Colorado and I went and
saw this place and I was touring a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different facilities and this,
this lighting company asked me to come by
[SPEAKER_00]: and see theirs and they had, they had a
grower who, who claimed to have written
[SPEAKER_00]: the book on LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing and he actually had a book how to
grow marijuana or cannabis and LEDs or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, the plants look so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were, they were, they were
having serious nutrient deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: pH issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, your pH is way too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're locking out magnesium and calcium
and you know, the plants are crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was, the boss was like,
Hey, can you walk through our facility and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a look and tell, tell me what's going
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, okay, grower guy,
like what's the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, he was like, well,
we got one, but it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on that shelf when nobody ever uses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, go get your fucking pH meter,
calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have calibration solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent him out to the gross store to
get like, you know, distilled water and
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came back and we ran this test,
but it was like, you know, he,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was, he had been spinning this tale of
lies to the investors about what was going
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truth was that he was completely
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was fucking and confident as a grower
way over his head and like a facility is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, 50, 60,000 watt facility
and just had no clue what he was doing at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and started to story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled the owner's side and I said,
it was the first time I'd ever done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt really bad, but I was like,
you guys need to fire this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we need to get rid of this grower
because he's fucking up your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fucking up your investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but it's, you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and it's not just in the gross
side, it's in the sales side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the processing side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the marketing side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's again, because, because again,
you get these peoples that come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, consumer packaged goods from CPG
and they're used to running these big
[SPEAKER_00]: companies just treating like whatever
product that is like a widget and applying
[SPEAKER_00]: the same, you know, supply chain
procedures to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't do that with cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is like shipping fresh
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like shipping like widgets from
China.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole supply chain needs to
respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the distributors and everybody,
otherwise you're, you're beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They end up fucking squash and molding by
the time, you know, they're, they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of the consumer and, you know,
developing these supply chains and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially you're building out a whole
industry from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's all these iterations
that have to go on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on top of everything, then we have a
provincial and federal oversight here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, which is stifling innovation,
stifling, moving the, the needle on the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, in some respects,
it's pushing it backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that we as in a province have to
sell to a provincial board is fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so this 25, 25 year old girl who got
a government job and is in charge of
[SPEAKER_02]: saying yes or no to the skews that I bring
to, to, to the province, to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: sell for my small cannabis course.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to tell me what she thinks
she's going to, what they're going to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: because her last job is a best buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, give me a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's, it's downright criminal.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have invested their lives,
millions and millions of dollars,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they grow a crop and they bring
it to a provincial board.
[SPEAKER_02]: The board says, no, we've already got
three, three other Sensi stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want your fourth one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just like, why, why can't I just go
right to the store and sell it to them
[SPEAKER_02]: then?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much more that needs to be done
up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Canada, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we love government.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing with, with oversight like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does stifle progression.
[SPEAKER_03]: In all industry, too much oversight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people would be remiss if I don't
ask Red about Ortega in your experience
[SPEAKER_03]: with your Ortega.
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience with Ortega.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I was over in Switzerland,
it was the first time I'd heard about
[SPEAKER_02]: Ortega.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was with a business partner over there
in a project and another one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: potential business partners flew over from
California with a couple of cuts right
[SPEAKER_02]: into, right into Zurich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they met us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, jeez, poor Ed.
Anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I like, yeah, I literally,
I think it was like in a backpack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two cuts that he brought over were
Ortega and what ended up being grapefruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was crazy because of cultivar we
were very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a pure Ortega cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ortega also, there was Ortega one,
two, and three put out by Neville while
[SPEAKER_02]: they were, they were Neville's last
batches he collected in California for
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed Bank Originals, which was one of
Legend's first companies that we ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: carrying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We carried Ed's seeds in Southern Tier and
then Neville's seeds in Seed Bank
[SPEAKER_02]: Originals that were in Ed's care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ortega one, two, and three,
which was a hash plant cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Ryan, help me out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember which was which.
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights, hash plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The NL hash plant was the one that he told
me personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, that is the most potent thing I
ever bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time I spent with the plant was
with the original Ortega mother cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and that one made to this day the
best hash that ever came out of one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those little hash shakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember those goofy little things
where you put the buds in a little screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one of those over there in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we would always be clamoring
to get the Ortega bud into this because it
[SPEAKER_02]: made that black sticky gooey, like almost
import style hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a hammer of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we didn't have labs and things
that we had access to back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my best guess is going to be heavily
mirror scene dominant because it made me
[SPEAKER_02]: sleepy as a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, and the size of the resin
heads were massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look underneath the microscope,
they were huge compared to the other
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars that we were growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up crossing the Ortega mother
with the sweet tooth number three at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became the BX2P1.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why Ryan's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a way better memory than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we created the legend's ultimate
indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have seeds of it too, luckily.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiny little pinhead seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lui was a really, really popular strain
for our company for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a clone house in Van and we pumped
out thousands and thousands of cuts a
[SPEAKER_02]: month out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got to the point that I think we killed
our own market within a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wanted it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every broker had Lui.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was a heavy yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was light green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out the boxes as far as fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you'd cut the tops in six weeks,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to cut the tops in six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just the selective phenol
that you guys had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the bulky phenol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my guess is that, and I know I was
bashing Kush earlier, but my guess is that
[SPEAKER_02]: the Ortega is probably some form of Kush
from way back when.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because just the potency alone and the
structure itself, they were buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a little bush with buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no cola structure to them
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a pile of buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew it indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I became very familiar with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: A small part of me would love to see that
out and about again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I get older, to be quite frank,
my flavour profiles tend more towards the
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorials and more towards the lemony,
the pineins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my favourite one right now is
cedarine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing it starting to come in piles
of different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cedarine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cedarine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's popping out in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of strains pop out of the
cedarine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother of all berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother of all berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not granddaddy, perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the kind of the grapes?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's plant of the grapes and mother of
berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two that I've seen,
the cedarine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very dominant, actually, in the COAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, can you ever taste it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an exciting kind of new flavour
profile that is becoming more dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've really gotten excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just, again, something
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something new and unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just smack you over the head with
nursing and pedicure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same old same old, which is 80% of
the shit I see every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, that goes to equatorials you
don't make money on if you're a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time-wise, yield-wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep threatening Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, you know, I'm going to get out of
this goddamn business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to open up a micro and just call
it the House of Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two drops a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like 16-weekers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call it a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seed market's actually slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I credit a lot to Chimera and Bodhi,
both of them, from doing work with
[SPEAKER_03]: equatorial sativas over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that people are finally starting
to realise there is unique highs that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can never reach in an eight-week plant or
a nine-week plant that you can get with
[SPEAKER_03]: these equatorial sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's slowly a niche market forming,
which is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm starting to see, you know,
when you're talking about more
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorial-leading cultivars, things like,
you know, are terpenolene dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, I'm a terpenolene junkie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like doing a line of herbal Coke,
you know, like vacuum my house in one
[SPEAKER_02]: shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing that our customers and our
patients in the scene up here in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're starting to be a bit of a segment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're starting to understand and be able
to differentiate these flavour profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want something that's just going
to couch-lock me all goddamn day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want something that's going to be a
little zippier, a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit-forward or floral in that sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, if you ever get a chance to look
at that flavour profile with a seeder and
[SPEAKER_02]: get all over it, man, because it's
beautiful.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did some work with Mother of All
Berries, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys want to go into the blues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your experience with blues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I mean, when we did the seeds for DJ
back in the early 2000s, I was floored at
[SPEAKER_02]: the variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it felt like every plant was some
different new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't coming out of the same seed,
but the variegation, the leaf variegation
[SPEAKER_02]: was like riddled throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you would see stuff that was
super ashy and then you would see stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that really kind of probably leaned
towards that equatorial Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That chocolate tie even.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you really believe Dan's,
you know, historical background on how he
[SPEAKER_02]: came to get these cultivars together
because you saw them in the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can see a lot of the variation
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the seeds that we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they arrived in Canada,
but my understanding was that these were
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds that actually came back from
Hank at Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DJ essentially reclaimed these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went after their deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Dutch Passion?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was Hank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Hank, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it was Saga Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Tony because he first he did a deal
with number Saga Martha was selling the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then Hank took it over.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those seeds have come back to
Canada and in this little I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like a 12 or 15 lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew like I don't know, it must have
been like 350 or 400 plants or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talking about over at G-Funks?
[SPEAKER_00]: At G-Funks, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was there was 350 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to pick males and all the
different lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picking males.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that rubber smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that bloody rubber smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that to me that the whole line was
filled with the rubber scents and the
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about the males?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the females though as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, when you rub the stocks of the
males, it just smelt like burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always rubbing males like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, there was there was some
really unique stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we were looking for early bars
because we were growing for growers back
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a breed for growers back then,
not for customers, which is a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: different headset, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, Jesus, Ryan, we must have had
about 60 males that we got down to and we
[SPEAKER_02]: were trying to select from those and I
mean, we're taking shots in the dark,
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: With males, you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to remember, too, that DJ was also
still down in Oregon at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he tried to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, over an eight week,
10 week crop, it's not it's not that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not there enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I've got a quick question to
interject.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with DJ in his book, he is quoted as
saying he would take two opposite plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So constantly making an F1 type,
but doing that in each successive
[SPEAKER_03]: generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that you think that's what kept up kept
up the variability while also inbreeding
[SPEAKER_03]: in odd ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, to me, I look at it like I
look at his whole log as a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the individual lines are really
like it's all it's it's all intermixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The variation so high while inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fixed some traits, but it didn't fix a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's definitely a downside to
doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a very art based method of seed
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a very unique take on on
breeding, for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the time it was that was cutting
edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least he was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and he was doing it on his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I think to me, the most important
thing about DJ's work is that he like made
[SPEAKER_00]: his top crosses, created his family and
then never added genes from the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was so interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where the to me,
the value lies, because that to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: those that family is is inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you when you out cross it,
that's where it shines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I found.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made me obsessed with the blue
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And understandably so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all the crosses we did and other
seed banks did with with Dan stuff all
[SPEAKER_02]: became like these really incredible and
famous bars that went down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I mean, how many obviously sweet
tooth, but I mean, all of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: we did with legends with that be 133
males, they were all banners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I loved I never got a chance
to recreate any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of a one off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, still always chasing that
great crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that great crush, Ryan,
that be 25.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that mom like?
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally from 10 feet away,
it smelled like someone just cracked open
[SPEAKER_02]: a can of great crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the bud structure was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a decent yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have that funky variegation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't doesn't have that mutation to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was literally like the shining star in
the right hand corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had this really neat star morphology to
like the round was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of odd to say, but it's like,
it kind of looked like the top is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like smooth, like the Bezos rocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even like the leaves that were coming
off, like the subtending leaflets,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they weren't triangular, they were
more like overweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and they had this like purple
ring kind of around the edge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaflet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a nice kind of lavender
purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like almost almost into the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was one of the rare ones that
were almost in the blue rather than the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's that's hard to find in the
blues.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sweet blue is probably the most
variated plant that came out of that room
[SPEAKER_02]: going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no two no two plants were the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of that, out of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, I still see people online
growing the sweet blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I still have some of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's the sweet skunk loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the sweet skunk itself is all over
the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine adding Danny's mail to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to get nothing but a
complete whack of individuals,
[SPEAKER_02]: but obviously some massive winners and
then some massive losers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where you get those plants that's
just bracket on top of bracket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make great hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad you had that nice one joint
from that whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of you guys actually did S1s of
the B130 mail, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I still got those in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would show up regular sex using
reverse mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm excited to get into Ryan's bank
once it gets set up in one spot and to
[SPEAKER_02]: really get a crack at what's in there
because it's like opening up a history
[SPEAKER_02]: book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, but that you're
creating new history by doing it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going through the list the
other day, actually yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's some shit that I
just totally forgot that was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is the thing though,
because I really believe this to be true
[SPEAKER_02]: is that we back in the day, we bred for
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was what was our whole mantra,
bred for flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people breed for now is for for COA
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: 28 to 31.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically- And IG pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And IG pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about how high perceived,
how high can I get from this 29% CHC
[SPEAKER_02]: plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's driving me nuts because you're
talking, you're drawing from one small
[SPEAKER_02]: population and it's KUSH based,
it's cookies based probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the same flavor profiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see these COAs come across my desk all
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I do is look at weed COAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell because Ryan's taught me to
be quite frank, how to read these things
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the family lines and it's all
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have 20 different names, but it's all
the same damn plant because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding for that number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see and go back to breeding for
flavor and breeding for flavor profiling
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what to me makes cannabis
unique and interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can go from there and then
have all these different flavored hashes
[SPEAKER_02]: and live resin and live rosin that we
didn't have back in the day that we could
[SPEAKER_02]: actually breed for specific end use
products.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not going to happen until R&D
becomes the main focus of these companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are just going to be growing
the same old tired shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same way in the cut flower
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're a grower that grows cut
flowers, you don't breed plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a specific model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I mean, even down in Salinas
when I was down there a few years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: working, there was a grower that was
growing the Phalaenopsis thaliana,
[SPEAKER_00]: the orchid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orchid that you see everywhere with the
nice pretty leaves and all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually the only orchid
producer in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might even be the world, but it was
definitely in North America that grows
[SPEAKER_00]: orchids from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a hard thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be an orchid collector and
growing orchids from seed is not fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do is they grow everything from
seed and then they sort it by color and
[SPEAKER_00]: they submit it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anything that's new and special,
they send in a tissue culture and they
[SPEAKER_00]: get, you know, they put it in the TC
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get millions once you find that
unique flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's their process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just grow everything from seed rather
from Phalaenopsis thaliana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool that there's somebody doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they were doing that, everybody
else is growing from tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, once you're growing from
tissue culture, it's great for producing
[SPEAKER_00]: armies of the same plant that are sterile,
but you can't get anything new from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to get anything new is to be
growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, I really see that as a unique
business model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty cool, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing the orchid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I collected orchids for so many years and
knowing how hard that is to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a really interesting, unique
business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't remember the name of the
grower, but if you're down in the Salinas
[SPEAKER_00]: or Monterey area, you should go and check
out their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I need to go up there soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a question for you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So down in California, I mean,
how much time does it take of our get down
[SPEAKER_02]: there before it's out of favor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's the average timeline?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, OK, so I want to say there's at
least a eight to nine year run that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: been seeing on the most popular stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I think it's getting a lot
slower, whereas, you know, like it gets
[SPEAKER_03]: popular in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see it kind of chase up to the
other states for five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Used to be eight to nine years before it
started hitting all the states,
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting the high times magazine stuff that
we favor down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's getting faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the OG Kush, I'm shocked that OG
Kush is still in so demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's had the longest run, I think,
out of any of the clones down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before that, it was like Hog's Breath,
P91, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was real popular in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now you couldn't even find most of
that stuff if you wanted to, except in
[SPEAKER_03]: seed form now, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But OG Kush has stood the test of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies, I think, I don't know,
is that the new OG?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be around forever and
everybody's just going to not be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: get high after their first hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is why I ask, because in
Canada, you got nine months with the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar before it, no one wants it
anymore.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's partially that liquor
distribution branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, I mean, it is a fucked up
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think what happened is,
in the past, it was the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more variation and more,
more different types of branded cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: on the dispensary shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because, I mean, California,
your dispensary market was like way more
[SPEAKER_00]: into a professional CPG type system where
you had real products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had like potato chips and soda
pops and fucking cars and everything right
[SPEAKER_00]: from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great vape, shatter, rosin, I mean,
you had it all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our rollout of dispensaries was a hell
of a lot less professional, more flower
[SPEAKER_00]: based, no real like, I would say finished
products like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that now that we've got
legalization and that brought in the
[SPEAKER_00]: advent of all these different types of
products, and so I think it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost as if like the Canadian buyer
or at least the distributor, the liquor
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution buyers are like a lot more
fickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, if it's not new,
they don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's, you know, it's like Kip said
earlier, it's like, you know, our liquor
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution brands, how many types of
Merlot or Pinot Noir do you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: they keep on their shelves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds of different producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the cannabis business,
it's like, if you already got two
[SPEAKER_00]: producers, growing a named variety,
they don't want that name variety anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And does that lead to lots of name
changing or is that even possible in the
[SPEAKER_02]: market?
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's weird here is that they'll
change an OG name to another OG name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have 90 kinds of OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for reals, any, any,
any dispensary in California, you go in,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll have half the menu, if not three
quarters of the menu, OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_03]: different kinds, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you, how do you sort through
that as a consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it's all the same cut anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you how they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They buy price.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a point of sale data every Monday
morning for every province in this
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what were people buying?
[SPEAKER_02]: My answer, the cheapest shit they can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only about eight to 12% of us that
are buying the expensive stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else is buying the cheapest
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they frankly don't care what it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, it's a funny thing about this
industry is that like you hear everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least all these industry people talk
about how everybody only wants the top end
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cream of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truth is, it's like they're
allowed 5%, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those guys, everybody that's talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that might be true for your,
your small mortgage or market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is, is when you look at the
aggregate market data, people want
[SPEAKER_00]: Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to sell brickweed in our
dispensaries here in my city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Compressed brickweed is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be considered an import?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I look down and I see literal
compressed brick every single collective
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ever been into in Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads to this fake, you know,
that whole OG thing, just to go back there
[SPEAKER_00]: for a second, leads to this really fake
situation where it's like the appearance
[SPEAKER_00]: of diversity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you have the appearance of
choice, but like, yeah, there's all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different names, but it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really like, you know,
they might even exclude like the best
[SPEAKER_00]: version of the OG, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the distribution board says,
no, we already got three of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to stock it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're probably turning away the best
one, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply not qualified to judge what
cannabis should be on the shelves and what
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's a completely flawed
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not going to change until the
provinces get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when's the last time a province wanted
to give away a cash cow that they've got
[SPEAKER_02]: right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, quite simply put,
the only time these kinds of things are
[SPEAKER_02]: taken away or, or, or given back into
private private hands is when conservative
[SPEAKER_02]: governments take control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you take the good with the bad,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, you know, my point was,
is that here in Canada, so you get nine
[SPEAKER_02]: months run with one bar before it just
stops selling, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people are done with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the new next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you support a breeding program
when it takes you a year and a half to
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with a cut and it's done in nine
months?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, there's no return on
investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's all, everything, me and me,
and a lot of the other guys that produce
[SPEAKER_03]: big seeds here in the United States,
a lot of us all kind of, it's all a shot
[SPEAKER_03]: in the dark right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is a shot in the dark and
hoping, and a lot of suck at hyping shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I feel like a used car salesman.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't like doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't do that and you don't
wear the jewels in front, like you're
[SPEAKER_03]: rich, you're not going anywhere and you're
not hyping anything and you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: starting a hype, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How ridiculous is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is the thing that I've hated
about the seed market since for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, it's all based on
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all based on ego, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it always was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's entitlement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's the loudest guy in the
bloody room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's, let's be honest about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even back in our day, who was the guy
that sold the most seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that screamed the most in the soap
box.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're Charles and you could go down the
road.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's what it was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the people that, uh, really that do
the quiet work, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and just kind of put their head down
to the, you don't never hear about those
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be a self promoter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because no one else is going to do it
for you, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's why when we were,
you know, both Ryan and I, when we were
[SPEAKER_02]: working those boards back in the day,
we give away hundreds of free seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was your best way to get
advertising was have a grower grow your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and go, man, this shit's the bomb,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, and you, but you can't do any of
that in this legal market right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's, it's all so,
so much oversight and so much bullshit
[SPEAKER_02]: laws are surrounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's going to be tough, but I got to
tell you, I'm waiting for someone to come
[SPEAKER_02]: out and beat the cookies brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm, I'm already tired of seeing
that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that whole branding and marketing
to me is childish and beneath most
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just hired a breeder who has never
made seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I know the guy personally,
he has never made seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a marketing guy, but he's now their
new breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty on brand for cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really sad, but until things change
and get taken out of some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: governmental hands up here, it's going to
be the same old, same old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just hope that, uh, you know,
Ryan and breeders like themself can find
[SPEAKER_02]: alternate ways to get their wares into the
market that are desperately needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so desperately needed new flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The COVID COVID also took a lot of us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know why I don't know the
correlation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if it's causation versus
quarterly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but when COVID hit,
a lot of us kind of started slowing down
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a bit as far as being able to sell
seeds, how much seed was moving,
[SPEAKER_03]: how many people were buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's been an interesting thing to
recover from too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the unknown.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are experiencing what the rest of
the world has gone through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, Amsterdam was the only
place in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when BC became online,
it was kind of the leading hotspot for
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, now, I mean, that was
when, you know, I mean, talk about like
[SPEAKER_00]: 1995 to call 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since, since 2010, I mean,
you guys have, we have a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: the banks popping up in the States now,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many Americans are ordering from
American banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you risk the border when you can
order from within, within the borders,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's foot the script now.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you see, I mean, up here, and I bitch
about it all the time because I can,
[SPEAKER_02]: but all I see are Yankee, so Cal Yankee
seeds up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all like gelatos, the cakes,
the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm so, I can't take another cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't take another cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendo breath, garlic breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, it's, it's, it's,
you know, there's 10 new licenses given
[SPEAKER_02]: out every Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's only so much, you know,
cannabis, you know, so many cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: buyers here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only so much weed that they're
going to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's the same 20 things because
they, everyone's running to that side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the boat and, you know, then they'll run
to the other side of the boat when the
[SPEAKER_02]: next new thing comes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's all coming out of Cali right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of any Canadian breeders that
are doing any significant work at any
[SPEAKER_02]: level right now, to be frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, there's more American breeders up
here doing work that are getting like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like there's a few big American
banks that are working with cultivators up
[SPEAKER_00]: here, just because that's who the
cultivators knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, they thought that like,
you know, the Canadian or the American
[SPEAKER_00]: guys were the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went down and made deals with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you got like American breeders
here and Canadian breeders can't even get
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to be able to mobilize
the old guard guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been around for a long time to
kind of bond together and figure this
[SPEAKER_03]: puzzle out, you know, because it only
benefits the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Kip said, I mean, there's so
many fucking big egos involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like try to get everybody under the
same tent and paddling in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good fucking luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always makes me laugh when I hear about
these potential processor co-ops and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, man, you can't get two growers
in a room to look at a black wall and
[SPEAKER_02]: decide what color it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck trying to think about packaging,
processing, distro, marketing,
[SPEAKER_02]: like good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed makers all consider themselves at
some point, some type of artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to just a bunk farmer that goes
one prop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's hard to get the egos rounded
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got to find that one sugar daddy
that likes to smoke enough weeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: get more money than brains and then let us
all have Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me show you the way Seth Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody needs to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, we're still young at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still new at this guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean truly, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legal, the legality of all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what it'll be five, five,
six years deep on a rec market way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my daughter is 11 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she ever decides she wants to
get into this industry in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to look at this bunch of
fucking dinosaurs compared to what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to go on in 10 years from now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can bitch and moan all we want,
but I'll tell you, it's better than me
[SPEAKER_02]: checking my next Nokia brick phone off the
bridge every four days because I'm scared
[SPEAKER_02]: some assholes reading my text.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll call it a win, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's been nice chatting about
all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an absolute pleasure to talk to
both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to have you both back on it
together or individually so we can cover
[SPEAKER_03]: some more ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been an honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolute honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure meeting both of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice to meet, you know,
family members because we all come from
[SPEAKER_02]: the same tribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get a chance to anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: My business these days, Ryan can attest to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm staring at COAs and Excel sheets these
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: My watering wand days are behind me,
unfortunately, right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm on the top of folks with passion
and insight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice break, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hit me up any time, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk to you guys later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
Cheers.
