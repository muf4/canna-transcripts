[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dog, Breeder and Grower from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Matthew.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my co-host, Not-So-Dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have with us today, Madjag and
Rejo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is one of the episodes I've
probably been looking forward to the most
[SPEAKER_04]: since we started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll leave it up to Madjag to kind of
start his tale because this is one I
[SPEAKER_04]: couldn't possibly begin to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Madjag, when you started getting into
growing, what was the impetus?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the start was a friend of mine who
was a dealer in Tempe, we dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw all kinds of loads coming through
over the years from the late 60s to,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, 73, 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would high grade the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all seeded loads at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he had Guerrero or if he had
Oaxacan, if he found that it was a great
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, he would keep the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, he started collecting all
these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day around 1975, he said,
why don't we just grow our own with these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds instead of having to deal with this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to test that theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the very first grow in 1976 I
did with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went up and found the spot that we
would potentially use in a remote canyon
[SPEAKER_00]: along the Mogollon Rim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mogollon Rim is spelled like Mogollon,
but it's pronounced Muggion or Mogollon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the southernmost edge of the
Colorado Plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stretches roughly from Williams
Arizona all the way to Mogollon,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico, 200 miles wide, this edge of
the plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along the edge are all these cracks,
let's call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're canyons with streams,
year-round streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably, I'd say, 20 canyons with
year-round streams in that 200 miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we chose one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you decided to choose that,
was it because you knew for a fact there
[SPEAKER_04]: was no real human interaction there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just so remote that nobody was going
down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunters stay up on top of the plateau
edges and stuff, or they're way,
[SPEAKER_00]: way down in areas that are easier to,
more accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: To hike down 1,600 feet into a canyon,
down a boulder-strewn wash through bushes
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, hunters wouldn't do it because
if they shoot anything, they'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just way too remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the criteria was we wanted,
it had to have a year-round stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to make sure that it was flowing
in the heart of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a Jeep trail dirt road that led close
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wouldn't have to hike more than
maybe two hours one way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we began testing it in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have my friend who was the dealer from
Tempe walk around down below while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the rim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had walkie-talkies back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just, you know, I'd go,
oh, I can see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wearing a white t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that had to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had a straw hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just can't be doing those things if you're
in the bottom of the canyon and hunters,
[SPEAKER_00]: cowboys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ranchers still use these areas back in the
early seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were grazing cows there,
even though it was national forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest would, was allowing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were, their permits go back
to the 1920s or thirties or forties,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they just allowed them to continue on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got tighter and tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually by, oh, let's say
late, late seventies, they stopped all the
[SPEAKER_00]: grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these areas in this particular area,
which was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A canyon away, some guys from Jerome were
growing and they parked their truck every
[SPEAKER_00]: week, week after week after week at the
end of a Jeep trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally the rancher using that area
called the forest service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came out and ran the plates and
found, oh, wow, they're from Jerome,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hippie capital of Northern Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was their scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't wait for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they didn't want to go down
inside in case, you know, it would become
[SPEAKER_00]: a shootout or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they waited until they harvested it and
took it all back to Jerome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they busted on Jerome with like a
hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't have any effect on you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it, it bothered us because they were
within five miles by air of where we were,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's so remote and so difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chose a canyon that was a lot better
known and people were known for hiking
[SPEAKER_00]: through it and swimming through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had sections of wall to wall water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our canyon was unknown and you couldn't
hike down from the top because there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: spot we called, um, uh, land, not lands
and the hall of the mountain king is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a hundred foot waterfall trap off
and you can't, you couldn't, you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: go down it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never had to worry about anyone
hiking downstream from where it started as
[SPEAKER_00]: a watch five miles away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did you guys, did you guys go in a
certain way that made it accessible
[SPEAKER_04]: enough, obviously for you guys,
but other people didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drove five mile Jeep trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, well, this first time with my
friend from Tempe, it was about a three
[SPEAKER_00]: mile Jeep trail and then maybe a thousand
foot drop off down into the canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it was a canyon that at the top
was heavily used by swimmers and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people who are into, um, crystal clear
pools and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lower part where we were,
um, there was no one, we never left
[SPEAKER_00]: footprints either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, these beautiful sandbars that are long
creeks and edges, we would just avoid them
[SPEAKER_00]: because we knew that if anyone did hike
through, that's the first place they would
[SPEAKER_00]: walk cause it was easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could always check for footprints
and our primary can imagine Canyon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which came the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in five years, we only saw one set of
footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, my partner pick up a
hitchhiker on the way back to the nearest
[SPEAKER_00]: town and he was the guy who had hiked
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we found out he, he was all excited
because he had hiked this 12 mile Canyon
[SPEAKER_00]: and saw nobody and he had hiked right by
our gardens and never knew it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good karma meeting the guy,
the hip.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I, what I find so interesting when I
was, when I was reading a little bit about
[SPEAKER_06]: your, your history and stuff is how
similar, um, although, although a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit different just due to geography.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when I first moved to Mendocino
County and we were doing gorilla before
[SPEAKER_06]: the medical era really started,
uh, was how similar the criteria was in
[SPEAKER_06]: that you were looking for somewhere very
remote, inaccessible, uh, normal people,
[SPEAKER_06]: hikers, hunters, various people wouldn't
ever go there, but you needed water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and you couldn't really take a vehicle
up there or even like dirt bikes or
[SPEAKER_06]: anything, because you never wanted to
leave a trail that would have been visible
[SPEAKER_06]: from the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would only get so, so close.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the rest of it was sort of
hooking it in and even hooking it in from
[SPEAKER_06]: like different angles so that you wouldn't
create a path in summer that would be
[SPEAKER_06]: visible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that, can I, uh, let me interject a
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were they flying looking for weed then,
or was that too early for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, there were, there were people who
talked about that, that going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we never saw that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have a helicopter land in our
Canyon in the only spot that was wide
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another weird one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their tracks went about, the tracks
from the helicopter went about 400 yards
[SPEAKER_00]: down the Canyon stop and then went back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought we were dreaming because we
didn't see the helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw these tracks and we followed
them to this little opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we got down on our knees and
looked carefully, little pieces of paint
[SPEAKER_00]: had chipped off the helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I forget what it was, the skids let's
call them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And left on the rocks, cause it's volcanic
rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew we were hallucinating and a
helicopter had landed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later we found out it was eagle
studyers from the university in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in, we're not sure which university,
but they were checking out all the canyons
[SPEAKER_00]: up there and getting out and hiking if
they saw eagles and trying to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers for their studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we felt okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, the actual looking for plants,
um, you know, if you were to open,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were to like clear a huge wide area
and leave it open and then just start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing such that you could stand on the
edge of a canyon and look down in and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that would be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to go in and out between the
bushes, make little patties that flowed
[SPEAKER_00]: from one to the next level and work it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later we even found out it made
sense because we were up on the rim
[SPEAKER_00]: looking down after watering and the
reflection on the mud was very obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: that this was an area that had gotten
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time we water, which was once a
week, we spread oak leaves and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves were there, we started piling them
up in advance and just threw them on top
[SPEAKER_00]: and totally stopped the reflection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We painted all of our hose connections
with brown spray flat spray paint so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we wouldn't reflect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we never wore white t-shirts or hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we had this photo that you have up
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my first, my second part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my first partner in Madjag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the guy I started with who's the
dealer, we, um, went separate ways kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: because he didn't, he lived in Tempe and
it wasn't, just wasn't feasible for him to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up and do this every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lived in the Verde Valley,
which I was still over an hour away,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it made more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this fellow that you see here was my
first partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in flag and this is what the
Creek looked like year round water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pond right here is what we pumped out
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our first garden was 90 feet above
the, the Creek level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a Briggs and Stratton four
horsepower, um, two inch fire hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it was, it wouldn't pump up 90
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to drop down to a garden hose
adapter that it forced it up to 90 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was different pumps we could
have gotten for more money, like six
[SPEAKER_00]: horsepower that weighed 150 pounds or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but we, we, it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took two hours, that first garden to
just move the hose around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only had one hose and we just move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In subsequent years, we created,
um, systems of hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just, you know, they all just
watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those, those, filled up little
patties and then those poured over onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the next level and to the next level,
because the, the train was relatively flat
[SPEAKER_00]: on these alluvial plateaus, but you know,
maybe a foot or two of, of, of
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus we, we raked it and leveled it and
use rocks to, to outline little patties so
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe there'd be two or three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Patty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next one would be next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had free hoses though, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that were on Siamese shutoffs and we
could open them up and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: spot hit other plants and it worked pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent a lot of time developing our hose
network, um, subsequent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like after that first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, you know, Mad,
Mad Jack, this is Raho.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, I want to jump in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're talking about all these
gorilla, um, tactics and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is back in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about when you were,
when you were doing all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: was any of this kind of inspired by the
war that we had just finished fighting in
[SPEAKER_01]: Vietnam and you know, the everything that
we used to hear on the news all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: about the gorilla fighters over there and
how they concealed what they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that when I was doing my gorilla
stuff, it was, you know, I'm listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: your stories and it's exactly like what I
did, except my stuff was all green and
[SPEAKER_01]: not, not rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but, uh, what, what,
what was your inspiration for the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog?
[SPEAKER_00]: The written word has always been my guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, this is, um, domestic growers
supply catalog from 1981, 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read about this in the whole earth
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I wrote in a way for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these waterbed classical tanks to
fit in the back of your trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull up to the edge of a canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew people who use this method and
it's all gravity feed downhill for 600
[SPEAKER_00]: feet to their spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, this, this is a small little
thing, small little catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has, but it does have a very nice
section on, on pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys, I don't know, once we
started making their second catalog in
[SPEAKER_00]: color, 1982, and they were based out of,
I think Oregon, let's see where this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they have all kinds of Guzzler
pumps, hand operated, um, where you just,
[SPEAKER_00]: that wouldn't work for us, but we've had a
few times where things broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to water by hand using five
gallon jugs, dipping them in the water and
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying them home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes four hours, five hours,
but, but you, you can't neglect it because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're there to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, it was good the way we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were fortunate because one week we
would flood irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We estimated in subsequent years that we
were putting 20,000 gallons on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on our little gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in this soft dirt that we used,
it would sink nice and deep and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots would follow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, but you couldn't go two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went like even 10 days,
which we tried to do a few times,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd come back and all the plants were
wilted and drooping or freaked out because
[SPEAKER_00]: we thought we had messed up and we went
ahead and watered and the next morning
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was standing up perfect and
looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're amazing plants, how they can,
be almost shriveled and then one water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever use any, like any water
retention crystals or anything like that
[SPEAKER_06]: to extend?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was, that was some,
that was some technique that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like by the time that I got to Mendocino
County and started doing stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_06]: there was already a lot of like,
I don't know if you want to call it Hill
[SPEAKER_06]: tech or older people that were passing
down how to get away with things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And infrequent watering was always,
well, how do you retain the water?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you, how do you keep it?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you keep things wet when you're
only checking on things every so often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our Canyon was 12 miles long and we,
we hiked it up and down to find the two
[SPEAKER_00]: spots that we, this was the first spot
that's on the camera right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other two spots we found were up
Canyon and we, you just don't come across
[SPEAKER_00]: alluvial plateaus at water level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're up at least 20 feet above and we
had to scramble up and look and scramble
[SPEAKER_00]: up and we'd be up in the rim and look down
and say, Hey, that looks like a good spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go back the next week and check
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we finally found our two spots,
this soil is wind deposited over centuries
[SPEAKER_00]: and decades and multitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was rocks in there, big boulders,
as you can see here, but in this,
[SPEAKER_00]: our very first place down below here is
where that photo was taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at almost at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the size of the coal is
sticking up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, the soil was just this beautiful,
rich volcanic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although when Robert Clark came down in
the second year of our new location,
[SPEAKER_00]: not this one, he said he couldn't believe
we were growing in dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, in Mendocino and up in
North, it's not dirt like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soil, like black, rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ours was brown and in gray and just
dirt, but it was easy to shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant that the water penetrated
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so did roots very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turned the soil down 18 inches,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only amendments we ever added were
bone meal and blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have to do a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the foliar spray saved us from this
twisting leaf thing that we, it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient that was missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it was molybdenum, but we sprayed
the plants and it saved our butts because
[SPEAKER_00]: they all untwisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you were, when you were,
let me ask a question in terms of,
[SPEAKER_06]: when did the growing season, like when
were you, when was it nice enough outside?
[SPEAKER_06]: That you were able to plant and how much
work did you do to prep in the winter,
[SPEAKER_06]: spring off season?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, you turned the soil and you
had to run all these hoses and prep all
[SPEAKER_06]: this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much pregame went into like preparing
the areas you were thinking about using?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had November and December and January
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were back out in February,
you know, preparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we started small at this garden here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at, and this photo is
probably a hundred feet by 50 feet with
[SPEAKER_00]: boulders and trees and stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it's, it blended in pretty well,
even from the... It does blend in really
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the next garden we used was three
times the size of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, we planted in between bushes and
trees, which you'll, I'm sure you've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in some of the photos and photos,
but when there were no plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: those between the bushes and trees were
the patties were, I'm just calling them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had to build up with rocks and
have it spill over to the next garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: the next, or the next patty and the next
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had free hoses too, to be able to
walk around and, and water with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took, I don't know, months of prep the
very first time because we had to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: down so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third year we grew,
we did two gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the year that Rob Clark came
down to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he only came down to see the one
easiest to reach garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this, this photo is kind of an
early photo of that first garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are little tiny plants in here
in these.
[SPEAKER_06]: That first garden was, so was that
primarily different, different types of
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexican that your dealer friend had
collected?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that, was that the primary seed stock
for the first season?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you were saying stuff about
Oaxacan, I believe, and some other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there any Colombian and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first year we just grew the
Mexican strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in this other Canyon that
people actually went to the top of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: would swim there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Canyon, we didn't start till my
partner that you saw down there next to
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, hold it right here, if you could
hold that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one or this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the last photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerial photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to jump through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how they stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evergreens here were giant pines and
small shrub oak trees and bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the rim, it didn't look too
blocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were scattered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really knew what you were looking
for, yeah, you would have spotted this
[SPEAKER_00]: from 1,600 feet above.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one really went to those edges in
those canyons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not, especially when it's 100
degrees out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just, I'd say this is one half
of this garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It extends over here and over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was only 30 feet above the creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was in a spot that you would never
expect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hiked up there and went,
holy cow, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to pump two inches of
water in a two inch fire hose up to this
[SPEAKER_00]: flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we put about 20,000 gallons
on here every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you mind me asking how old you were?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 28.
28.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, 28 and 29 and 30 when we were doing
these three canyons, these three gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my partner was the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all just late 20s and right around
30 when we started doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 76, though, I was only 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still in contact with any of the
other guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're all still with us?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively speaking, the dealer from Tempe
has, what's that disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now in a wheelchair after 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made it 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, MS, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: MS, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's kind of restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another partner who was the very last one
I worked with, he was a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all knew each other independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was great because we're all
originally friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has early onset Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has great long-term memory,
but he can't drive a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he gets in a car and starts driving,
he doesn't remember where he is within a
[SPEAKER_00]: block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my first partner that you saw there in
Madjag came down by the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's six foot seven, and he's a big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still around, and I see him every
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my partner for the last two years in
Madjag, he lives in Taos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's originally from the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: One who just wrote The Year of the Madjag.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fictional account of using all of
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's more about a love affair he had
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got an honorable mention in the F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott Fitzgerald competition or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is writing a second book now already
that's going to be more factual.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pilot friend, he's in the Chronicle I
wrote called I Know the Guy Who Knows the
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked to him a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called me because he just fell and
broke his hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to invite him to be on this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the hospital in Anchorage,
Alaska now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bizarre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the universe didn't want that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had kind of thought, he wouldn't
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes Mr. Nice look small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go into his story later if you don't
mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I saw him physically in 1985
until last year, they were just working on
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 tons of hashish from Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the level he worked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never was busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know it's it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you knew him, this is why I was so
intent on getting this show, because I
[SPEAKER_04]: think, you know, we talk about a lot of
the people who who we have been put on a
[SPEAKER_04]: pedestal in our scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, of course, Sam, the skunk man,
Rob Clark, amazing people obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: deserve their accolades.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the big heroes in the scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's some guys who did some really
big, bold stuff that don't quite get seen
[SPEAKER_04]: for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it has to do with the fact that
it was clandestine and illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's in some folks don't even still
want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are some amazing stories out
there that I've come across over the
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yours was one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking to someone that you were able
to bring with you, Raho, I wanted to get
[SPEAKER_04]: into a little bit with you, Raho.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk about when you first started
collecting and getting into growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's man, it seems like so long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was just a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: 78 was the first time I smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then, you had to smoke,
you know, three, four or five times before
[SPEAKER_01]: you ever actually felt the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was because the
concentration of THC wasn't so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as high as it is today,
or maybe the stuff that kids could buy on
[SPEAKER_01]: the street back then wasn't so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, by the time, by the time I
got high, that very first time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I was 15 years old, after school
at a buddy's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we, it took a while to kick
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after I was, I was actually riding my
bike home, thinking, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: another time that it didn't work when it
started to hit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beautiful spring day,
the sun was out, you know, the air was
[SPEAKER_01]: just it was one of those days where the
air was crisp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the temperature was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm cranking away on this 10
speed bike, and the wind is blowing in my
[SPEAKER_01]: face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, I kind of noticed
that the, the air and the light and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is just kind of alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the feeling of the wind and the air
circulating around me and in my face and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything just became like, you know,
it was like, it was like I was connected
[SPEAKER_01]: with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a just a wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I get I get home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put on, I put on some music because
I'm really cranking at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's really kicking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I drank I drank plenty
of beer and, and, you know, but this was
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing like it, you know, and I put on
these headphones and it's Ted Nugent Great
[SPEAKER_01]: White Buffalo, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wide open and cranked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, that's,
yeah, you know, that song, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Great White Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the heightened senses and all of it
going with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old were you then?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old were you, Rahul?
[SPEAKER_06]: 15.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was listening to that, it sounds
like you had your very own bicycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what happened to Albert
Hoffman when he first took LSD is he
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he got on a bike and started going
around and all of a sudden colors and wind
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm starting to feel something unusual.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Celebrate today.
[SPEAKER_06]: They call it bicycle day because he took
acid accidentally and then he hopped in
[SPEAKER_06]: his bike and he and he started driving,
you know, riding around and all of a
[SPEAKER_06]: sudden things started altering on him and
he really wasn't sure what was happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thought it was the most beautiful
experience he'd ever had and wanted to
[SPEAKER_04]: give it to everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of similar to what you just
said.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, that's what makes it colors and
the wind and you were very in tune with
[SPEAKER_06]: nature and like you're riding your bike.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just kind of triggered that for me of,
of your, your head space changed and all
[SPEAKER_06]: of a sudden the world was born to new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean to share that experience or
similar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With, with such a famous man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great story, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, that was,
that was the first time getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I came down, you know,
mom and dad came home from work and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, God, can they tell, you know,
dinners prepared and everything it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, starting to reflect on what's
what's happened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that, you know,
the last seven years of my life that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been told these things in school about
drugs are bad, you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're evil and they'll make you want to
jump off of a building because you think
[SPEAKER_01]: you can fly or you'll be violent or,
you know, you'll immediately be addicted
[SPEAKER_01]: and fiending for more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, it was just all of
a sudden I just started questioning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I'd ever been told by the,
by the authorities, you know, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: lied about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they lied about that, what else did
they lie about?
You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, almost as every,
every bag of weed that, that I got after
[SPEAKER_01]: that, and there were many, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, you know, never,
never been the same, but every bag came
[SPEAKER_01]: with seeds back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, two fingers,
[SPEAKER_01]: two fingers for a quarter, one finger for
a dime bag, you know, half ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, simple math,
but there were plenty of seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, where I lived, you know,
in the Southeast, it was mostly Colombian
[SPEAKER_01]: that we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know Madjag, you know,
they got lots of Mexican out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was very close to, to where it came
from and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us, you know, buying kids buying
weed on the street, it was, it was
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial Colombian most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's just loaded with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the very next year in 79, I tried to
grow my first garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I had a tray full of
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been gardening with my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since I was a little kid,
you know, in the vegetable garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes and cucumbers and watermelon and
you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But growing, growing weed was just another
garden thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got them to sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I might've even used the paper
towel method, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: because after I started smoking it,
I immediately discovered high times
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine and it became a monthly ritual of
going down to the bookstore and picking it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was at the beginning of high
times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 76, 77, 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it had been around for a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think 70 was the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but, you know, I took those sprouts
and I put them out in the bright full
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight, you know, that I started them
indoors under a little fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put them with no hardening at all
under the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went out the next day and they were
all dead.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the end of, you know,
year one, total failure, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the next year I came back and I hit it
pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and me and a couple of friends of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are your parents with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just amazingly open-minded about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's at one point, maybe it was
81, I think I started, I started breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had picked up, uh, Rob Clark's,
um, marijuana botany, botany, and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just so inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it, it, it really,
everything just clicked as far as the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the science of breeding and, and,
um, the way that he described,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, genetics and, and selection and
creating hybrids and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all, it was all so intuitive to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all just made complete and total sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I immediately wanted to make my own
seeds and start breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, that meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know, we, we wanted smoke
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we needed to segregate the males and I
wound up bringing these male, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica plants into my parents' house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I mean, I had these things
in the dining room, in the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just stinking, you know, I don't know
how, I don't know how they put up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my, my, my mom's gone now,
so I can't, I can't ask her that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like, um, you know,
obviously he's, you know, he's messing
[SPEAKER_06]: with Oaxacan and different things from
Mexico, you know, Arizona and the,
[SPEAKER_06]: and New Mexico and that are not that much
different climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're in the Southeast of the
United States and you're getting mostly
[SPEAKER_06]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you, that second year where you
didn't kill your seedlings and you got a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot farther down the path.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hit a point where you were like,
are these ever going to finish?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, that second year,
uh, we had a neighbor across the street
[SPEAKER_01]: had pulled in a harvest in 79.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of, one of the, one of his friends
had gone to Maui for Christmas and had
[SPEAKER_01]: come back with seeds of what I know now
was Maui Waui in 79.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he grew, they grew a big patch of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it was, it was wild leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, I know today that it
was, uh, it was Mexican and, and some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of Indica hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it finished early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had amazing taste and, um, being a poor
kid that cut lawns for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, luckily that half of their crop was
seeded and they sold me the seeded stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: for cheap cause nobody wanted it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So back then, nobody wanted seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I mean, everything was
seeded, you know, when you, when half your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop is seedless and they made t-shirts,
you know, that says sins and they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were selling, you know, yeah,
yeah, yeah, they were, I'd love to see
[SPEAKER_04]: some of those today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I'm such a nerd for all the
old vintage shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you ever see one, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, kids immediately turn into,
you know, these instant entrepreneurs when
[SPEAKER_01]: they wind up with, with, you know,
a bedroom full of weed hanging from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all of a sudden, you know,
it turns into, well, all my friends are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much am I going to charge for it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, you got lucky in the
sense that you got a hybrid that would
[SPEAKER_06]: actually finish in your area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I always had this idea and I'm
obviously like in 19, when you guys are
[SPEAKER_06]: speaking of 1975, 77, 78, uh, I was still
happily in diapers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so that's definitely not my,
my part, but I always thought that like
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe the first American breeding was
you're getting this import from Thailand
[SPEAKER_06]: and Columbia and Panama and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, well, how the hell do I
get this to finish where I'm at?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I have to take this Mexican and I
can shorten it up some because this
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexican seems to be quicker, but this tie
and this Colombian is taking a million
[SPEAKER_06]: years and it's getting cold and it's
getting rainy and my stuff doesn't even
[SPEAKER_06]: look like it's done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean that, that, that Maui was,
was only part of the crop that we did that
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was, um, we, we also had a
Mexican and we had, we had a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombians, um, you know, it was,
and all my friends were growing at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, uh, everybody had a couple
of plants out in the woods and we'd go to
[SPEAKER_01]: a party on Friday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's parents were out of town and
sometimes they'd walk you out behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: house and you know, into the woods behind
their house and there'd be a little six
[SPEAKER_01]: foot Colombian Christmas tree in a,
in an opening in the woods behind their
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just a, just a little hole in
the canopy where the sun came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, um, yeah, so those Colombians,
you know, they would, they would,
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't, we never really finished them
as, as we know, you know, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, resin glands and they weren't,
they were never really properly finished,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they were finished well enough that,
you know, um, we, we could get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of November and sometimes even does,
you know, first couple of weeks of
[SPEAKER_01]: December where I lived, uh, before,
before the frost would.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hardest part is actually,
you know, not picking it early kids didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know any better than we just wanted to
smoke the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, I mean, we were just
going off of the, the weather reports in
[SPEAKER_01]: the newspaper and sure, you know,
farmers, Almanac bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, maybe I could ask a question of
both of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, these first couple of years that you
guys are both describing, what were the,
[SPEAKER_06]: what were the, the aromas?
[SPEAKER_06]: What were the scents?
[SPEAKER_06]: What were the terpene?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, no one's no one used terpenes
back then, but like, what were the,
[SPEAKER_06]: what did the weeds smell like to you?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, did it just smell like weed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you, did you get citrus?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get any kind of skunk?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get, did you smell like weed?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you can remember what aromas
were you getting off these original
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexicans and, and Colombians and these,
and these, or even a 1979 skunk one,
[SPEAKER_04]: what would that smell like?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, you're going to get there,
but I was just curious as like,
[SPEAKER_06]: what, what did, what Hawkins smell like,
you know, like did it because,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we know, we know these lines
from like way later when they've been
[SPEAKER_06]: worked by people extensively and bred in
different directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sounds like you guys were getting
it basically from the farmer, the source
[SPEAKER_06]: and the, yeah, from unadulterated from the
farmer in the source, actual, like what we
[SPEAKER_06]: would call land race today, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go first, uh, Matt Jagger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the very first, I'll just,
um, I have a little startup here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two joints I bought were in 1966
from the only hippie in my high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I, I wasn't quite ready to smoke
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them in a bottle and buried them
in my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two years later when I dug them up and
thought, Oh, try them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just mold, pure mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that didn't work, but they had,
um, you know, your really earliest weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I remember smelling from my friend
in, well, when I went to, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, pine, pine terpenes really stood out
in 1975 or 76, some growers weed from
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Barbara was showing up in the Verde
Valley in Sedona, Cottonwood, Jerome area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably coming through Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it smelled just like fresh pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smelled weed like it again
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, if you close your eyes and just held
it up, you would think you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had pine soul in your, in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a Christmas tree style or pine soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, more of a Christmas tree style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural pine.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was since EMEA, it, it was strong and
it was very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we smelled that tieweed
though, tie stick had a total different
[SPEAKER_00]: scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was heavy and earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I remember seeing early tie sticks in
1970, 71 that were supposedly dipped in
[SPEAKER_00]: opium too, or opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pass a water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had white on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat down with some black hash once that
was opiated supposedly a little black.
[SPEAKER_00]: White specks of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cut out with the razor blades,
every white speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have enough to take a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't opium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get us any higher, but it made
the costs go up when people were buying
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid more for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've looked a lot into that situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, especially when researching chocolate
tie, because a lot of that theory behind
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolate tie was that it was dipped in
something called Pasha water or pasta
[SPEAKER_04]: water, which was the, the, the water that
was left over from producing heroin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had the alkaloids, the morphine
alkaloids and stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And supposedly the story was that they
would dip it in that, but there's not
[SPEAKER_04]: really any proof of any of this ever
existing anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was the theory behind it and
where it kind of all stemmed from it may
[SPEAKER_04]: have happened once or twice, but I don't
know if it ever really got out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I've heard about people being charged
massive amounts of prices for these tie
[SPEAKER_04]: sticks that they were supposedly dipped in
this water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Debates about that online, but yeah,
you know, it's a, I think it's been pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much debunked mostly because the people
growing the two different crops weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: really the same people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them weren't producing
heroin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like not like before we lose track,
what was the taste that you were getting
[SPEAKER_06]: off, uh, off your Hawaiian hybrids that
you were successful with that second year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you know, the, the Mexican
versus Colombian, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty, pretty distinctive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually associate, uh, cedar tastes and
kind of a, kind of a citrus, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus, piney, cedary taste with,
with Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew some beautiful Alokan a couple
of times that, you know, it flowered so
[SPEAKER_01]: much faster than the Colombian that I
actually let it go too long to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where it was, it was actually actually
over mature and I, it had lost some of its
[SPEAKER_01]: potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but that was contrasted with the
Colombians, which were, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually we'd get a lot of purple,
um, because they'd be coming in so late
[SPEAKER_01]: that just the temperature change would,
would bring out a lot of purple colors in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, once something turns purple,
that, um, what's that, what's that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's not core fill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anthocyanins really seemed to affect
the taste and always do affects the taste
[SPEAKER_04]: and smell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and personally, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you know, like, like Madjag said,
the, uh, you know, the pine was,
[SPEAKER_01]: was there in the Colombian and,
um, there's a, you know, difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between the smell and the taste when you
smoke it, um, there's, um, there is,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some of it has kind of a
chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I don't want to
completely sidetrack things into a haze
[SPEAKER_01]: talk, but, you know, my, my belief is when
I, when I started growing O'Hays,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, a few years ago,
I found that the effects, one day I just
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that the effects that I got from
smoking O'Hays and even the tastes were
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: As what I felt that first time I got high
riding that bicycle home, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, yeah, the Colombian and, you know,
that, you know, it really kind of messed
[SPEAKER_01]: with my head a little bit because for so
long, people talked about haze as the
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture of, you know, four different kinds
of, of sativa Mexican, Colombian,
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai, and Indian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, trying to figure out,
how this, what, what is obviously a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Sam's the, the O'Hays as it's
been released to the world since,
[SPEAKER_01]: since, uh, Sam brought it to Amsterdam,
um, you know, is not everything that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they made when the poster was made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pedigree was described.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, that's what Sam brought with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Sam preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Sam shared a three way
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the Indian, not the Thai, not,
not the Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the tastes are there,
you know, there's kind of a chocolatey
[SPEAKER_01]: taste to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, earthy, you could call it,
there's piney, um, you can find some
[SPEAKER_01]: sweetness in there, some citrus,
there's different phenos in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's all coming from Columbia as far
as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we can have a debate and
I'll, I'll let anybody believe what they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I genuinely think like right now,
uh, there is a man with the letter D for a
[SPEAKER_04]: name that is just smiling ear to ear.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it, when a Neville's old partners had
been talking to me and not so a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically about Sam's O'Hays being so
Colombian dominant, being so Colombian
[SPEAKER_04]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, the 69 Hayes was it that Neville
had gotten the first time was very much
[SPEAKER_04]: more like Southeast Asian dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the main difference between
the Hayes Neville was using and why
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville's Hayes became so popular and why
a lot of the O'Hays, supposedly that's one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the theories why O'Hays didn't come as,
as much as it had promised.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminded me of something actually,
because, uh, it had been mentioned,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, earlier on, on the thing is that when,
you know, Thai and stuff like that was a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit broader leafed, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, you know, he made a point that,
you know, Sam and those guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: they kept reading towards the thin leaf
because they thought that was more sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but that was actually more Colombian
sativa and that some of the Southeast
[SPEAKER_06]: Asian stuff and some of the ties,
it's not like they were fat leafed,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they were broader leafed than,
um, pure Colombian was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a picture of a tie I grew in 81.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was a tie stick from 1980 that
a friend brought home from college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, older brother of, of one of my
partners brought home from college and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, in Colorado, and it's very thin
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, you know, people talk
about with tie, the alligator tail leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a broad leaf, uh, extreme serrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's, you know, it's, uh,
it's, it has a reputation for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that was, you know, it's a,
it's a big country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, we all know from
growing that, man, you can't even pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, pop a 10 pack of seeds without seeing,
you know, a couple of narrow weaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in there with the wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why should we think that an entire
country is going to produce nothing but
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, microclimate everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For, um, for Matt and myself, um,
you know, when I was first started
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking, the only real two kinds of import
I ever saw was Brown Mexican and green
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I came up a little later, the tie,
the Colombian, the, you know, the
[SPEAKER_06]: Panamanian, all some of these different
regional things, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_06]: the shift towards all those groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly importing cocaine had already
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of the diversity and imports had
changed and there was still a bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but that's kind of all it was for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same experience for me, even a decade
coming in a decade, I think after not so
[SPEAKER_04]: where I was starting, it was the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Mexican was it, you know,
talking about these Mexicans, I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about Madjag's experience with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I don't want to, can we just
stick a pin in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make one more point about the
haze and the, the Colombian, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the Colombian roots of it,
as we know it today, um, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Columbia just like we were just
discussing Thailand is, is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously going to have a diverse range of
different, uh, different chemo type
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but you know, in Columbia,
you had reds and golds and green and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so many different types and,
and, uh, they all had such distinctive
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors and tastes and effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I was lucky, you know,
when I started doing this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was, it was the end of the glory days
of those elite, um, those elite types of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smoke the, um, Panama,
Colombian red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got to smoke real San Amaro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, they all have things in
common, but, but they were some unique
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics about them that just,
you know, Viva Difference, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a big, big, big fan of, uh,
are the connoisseur and high times
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, uh, he inspired me to become a
connoisseur of life and appreciate all the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between things and savor them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I want to point this out just
because I, I just, even a recent episode,
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a statement that I thought R was
Robert Clark, because that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_04]: people have been saying forever or it's
assumed, but I think that might be wrong
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's, that's an important note
to make because I have always associated
[SPEAKER_04]: everything Robert Clark's ever written
with are the connoisseur and I love are
[SPEAKER_04]: the connoisseur and I love Robert Clark
too, but I've always associated them as
[SPEAKER_04]: the same person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Rob himself because long ago,
um, I wondered the same question and he
[SPEAKER_00]: said, no, and I, I've actually heard R's
real name and I can't remember it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but someone I know from Manhattan
knows him and, and said, oh no,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a different guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if he's still with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be great one to interview.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I'm curious about, I don't want
to, there's so many threads that happen in
[SPEAKER_06]: these kinds of convos you could lose it
at, but, um, when you were describing how
[SPEAKER_06]: difficult it was to get to your Canyon
grows, um, having done some gorilla myself
[SPEAKER_06]: and hidden, um, obviously like a growing
it is one thing, but then harvesting it
[SPEAKER_06]: and drying it and getting it out of there
is another thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you talk for a minute about what
that was like if you're going down some
[SPEAKER_06]: goat trail through the rocks and all of a
sudden you have several hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be, you know, that,
I mean more like a thousand pounds when
[SPEAKER_06]: it's wet, you know, did you try to dry it
there in the bushes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hike it all out one by one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, how much effort went into that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I, that's a real struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, once we started growing in our own
Canyon in Madjag Canyon, we did
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, um, except for that first year
where you had the photo of my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down next to the water, but the subsequent
two years with my partner from the UK and
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a Swiss helper too, who I'm still
good friends with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him three years ago in Zurich.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, we did everything down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We manicured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dried it, manicured it, boxed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we bought knocked down boxes from a
supplier in Phoenix that were roughly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say about, well, for 12 inches by
eight inches by six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that held a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we brought Kelty pack frames that were
just bare frames without the associated
[SPEAKER_00]: baggage on them and bungee cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could stack five of these boxes on
one Kelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could carry out five pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every, every bit was hiked out that way up
this 1600 foot washed of boulders and
[SPEAKER_00]: strewn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had pruned a few branches here and
there, where you just had to have
[SPEAKER_00]: clearance to get under a pine tree or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were very fortunate because our,
one of the people in my life who's still
[SPEAKER_00]: around, he was one of the two princes of
peyote that I've written about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also is a huge weed dealer and he would
meet us at the edge of our Canyon after
[SPEAKER_00]: sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would just hike up Hanum house.
[SPEAKER_00]: However many boxes we brought up and he'd
hand us a paper bag full of cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't have to even drive to
Phoenix or, or take the risk of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: take it back home because that was
actually the thought of working that hard
[SPEAKER_00]: for a year and then losing it all because
you got a traffic stop that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a hundred dollars an ounce,
1600 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the standard price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sold it all by grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold it for $10 a gram to college
students at ASU.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived two blocks away from,
from ASU.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just would buy everything we had and
just slowly sell it over a year or two and
[SPEAKER_00]: triple his money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you had a, you had a, you had one or
two friends that were helping you,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So when it comes to hiking, if you could
bring it out, if you could bring about
[SPEAKER_06]: five pounds at a time, that means each
trip, you're probably at a maximum of 10
[SPEAKER_06]: or 15 pounds.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought in six more people at
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I was like,
man, you were really fit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your legs, your hiking ability was intense
because it's a lot of back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that part, I mean, I've,
I've hiked down gasoline, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallons of gas is like 35 pounds and
we tripped a bag of garbage bags and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would still stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing because shaking it and
moving down, it was so difficult to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it not from saturating everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at harvest time, boyfriends and
girlfriends of ours and others,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, at most we had eight people down
there, manicuring, um, we, we set up 10 by
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 foot Coleman classic tents that were
spray painted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were a light brown color,
but we sprayed them with a little darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: and green and they blended in very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we limbed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we cut, we cut a whole plant if we
could, if it wasn't too big, we'd hang it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'd cut the branches off,
limb them and stack them like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that all the way up inside these
tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case it did rain, we weren't going
to get caught in, you know, with her,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plants getting wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you do a lot of sun drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was all, we hung between trees and
just hung them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was still in the nineties or
eighties in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night it would drop up up where we were
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growing at about 4,500 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, at night it would cool down,
but in the day this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus we were growing in our main garden
was in an East West situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun, when it came up, it hit very
early and it went almost to the end of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the night because it did drop below the
Canyon edge at each end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of our gardens was in a North
South section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only got seven feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven hours or eight hours of direct
sunlight at max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still the plants grew perfectly and
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the East West gardens, you know,
they got 10, 11 hours of direct sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: were awesome.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew much bigger plants, much taller,
fuller.
[SPEAKER_06]: What, when did the, when did the Mexicans
naturally finish?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when was your harvest time?
[SPEAKER_06]: When, when were they ripe those first few
years for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: October.
[SPEAKER_06]: October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colombian, you had, you passed a photo
by there earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, it was, it was snowing on the
rim above us on Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a, that was the North South
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called the Anasazi.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the hall of the mountain King.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot, you know, that kept hikers
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colombian, the Colombian, we didn't
know about these things, about finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: and how long they would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was crazy because it was,
they were the size of my little fingertip,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the buds and it was Thanksgiving
and snowing above us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anymore Colombian after that first year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, was it by R?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, there's this famous, there's this
famous list of seeds that's been
[SPEAKER_06]: attributed to Sam or it's been attributed
to others or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it had a bunch of, you know,
hazes and skunks and different things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what was interesting about it is it
was organized by month that it finished
[SPEAKER_06]: and there was only three or four things
that finished.
[SPEAKER_06]: It finished in October.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was probably 10 things that finished
in November.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was like 25 things that
were December or January, which is like a
[SPEAKER_06]: polar opposite today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Rob was growing in Ben Lomond just
above Santa Cruz in the Redwoods there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, you know, the, the temperatures
were very Mediterranean in a sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back, I wanted to jump forward to a
question when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino and up north, did you ever,
do you know where Redway is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The town of Redway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I met my Colombian friend and
future partner in many escapades at the
[SPEAKER_00]: country tavern there in 1972.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy from Scottsdale owned the country
tavern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also had his own chemist and he
produced millions and millions of hits of
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we went into that tavern,
the first time half the people were
[SPEAKER_00]: tripping and it was just, wow,
it was like insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my Colombian friend who I just met
there, he took me on a hike down towards
[SPEAKER_00]: shelter Cove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelter Cove was, was just five houses
then that were abandoned because it was a,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone told me, someone tried to do a
subdivision there and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we hiked down, we went off into the
woods cause he knew about a few plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw my first plants over there that
were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were individual holes in between the
redwoods, like where there was a spot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sun shooting down in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just this beautiful black rich
soil and their plants were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably six or seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, wow, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that's my part of the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: I moved to Mendocino County in 1998 and
I've lived there since.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Southern Humboldt in general,
Mendocino, Lake, all those areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of like my stomping grounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, like, like you were saying
with LSD or whatever else, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: there was back then it was remote.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was mountainous.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could get, you know, there wasn't very
many people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your worries up there were hunters and
loggers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But lots of people went up there to kind
of get away from things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people grew weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people did other things, but it was
that isolation and that, and that being
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of out in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was kind of, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea how this guy from
Scottsdale found Redway, but that he
[SPEAKER_00]: bought the tavern there and he was living
nearby and his chemist was somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: nearby out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was an interesting place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where my Colombian friend was,
Gerardo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was on a student visa, but he
overstayed an extra eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he spoke, he learned English
simultaneously with Spanish in Colombia
[SPEAKER_00]: and Cali since he was five years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he spoke such perfect English that
later in life when we were, our big,
[SPEAKER_00]: big bust happened, he was interviewed by
FBI agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: He corrected their spelling twice because
they didn't know how to spell the words
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty funny.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, another thought I had,
you met, you mentioned, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: Howard Marks' book, Mr. Nice and how your
friend kind of blew him out of the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember a long time ago when I read his
autobiography that he said that basically
[SPEAKER_06]: his autobiography was full of people that
had been busted and that some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: coolest and biggest people that he
interacted with had never gotten trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore you weren't going to hear
anything about them in his book because
[SPEAKER_06]: they had skated through and nobody knew
about them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he wasn't about to give any tips or
ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he said his book was essentially a
collection of people that had gotten in
[SPEAKER_06]: trouble and that there was many who didn't
and they were invisible.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend who broke his hip and was our
pilot friend, he never got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave my UK partner the go ahead
that he would be willing to let him write
[SPEAKER_00]: a book about him and interview him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said to him, you're going to have to
follow this guy because he's all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now he's in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on the anchorage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could probably get some weeks of
talk with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, he goes, he still goes to
Hong Kong and Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the guy is he's 75 and he got
his pilot's license when he was 15 before
[SPEAKER_00]: he could drive a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we figured it out once.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stopped keeping a log book at 10,000
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that most TWA pilots never hit
10,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But literally lives in his plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he went to Alaska and bought
a gold mine, the only way to get to it was
[SPEAKER_00]: to fly in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and as you know, in Alaska,
everyone uses planes like cars,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if they live way out in the
woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he he owned the airport once in a town
that I lived in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one really knew about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like Mr. Nice's Howard Marks friends,
because he got into Afghanistan in the
[SPEAKER_00]: late 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was importing lapis, the deep blue
stone that highly valued in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led to hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just sending home a few pounds
rolled up in Afghani rugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would just ship them and they would get
through back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't even using dogs really to
check stuff in the late 60s or 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then his friends slowly, you know,
moved to freighters and they were sending
[SPEAKER_00]: freighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the Soviets took over,
he couldn't go to Afghanistan any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he moved over to Peshawar in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Peshawar now is known as the terrorist
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's where all the terrorists
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he would he was active over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I said last time I met him in 85 in
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a houseboat in Sausalito,
and I met him there and he was visibly
[SPEAKER_00]: shaking because he was so excited about
the 60 ton barge that they were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull across the universe, which they did
more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking outlaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would go to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada had he said they had only like a
thousand, not even a thousand,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few hundred agents in involved in drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those West Coast places above
Juneau in Alaska and that were perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in Canada, along the coastline.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Canada has much more of a hashish
culture than America did because of that
[SPEAKER_06]: importing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I think not only that,
but it was like the penalties if you got
[SPEAKER_06]: caught in Canada were far less than the
American ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it reached there, it would get
him exported over to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy, he he had a a passport he
paid ten thousand dollars for from the UK
[SPEAKER_00]: in like 1969 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a real passport.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was able to have it fixed with his
name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would he would walk across the
border to Canada and then fly from Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world as a British citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he was going to Afghanistan and
Pakistan, he wasn't an American.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was British.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then he'd fly back to Canada and
walk across the border into Washington and
[SPEAKER_00]: be and then go back to his normal life
over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, after my own heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also had one of the first phone
scramblers I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought it from a company in Amsterdam
and you held it up to the phone and the
[SPEAKER_00]: little rubber cups went over each end and
then you talk to the back of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was used and stuff like that,
you know, by 1970, 1971.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very security conscience, fella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so I was going to say we we've we've
kind of wandered off the mad jag part,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's one part that like totally,
totally enthralled me with the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was about not just about the wizard
robes or any of that, because I find that
[SPEAKER_04]: so amazing, like the pictures of you guys
with the wearing the wizard robes and
[SPEAKER_04]: being very serious about all of this,
but how well you treated the land and how
[SPEAKER_04]: you respected the land and the culture
that came before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a lot of your writings,
you talk about even finding ancient like
[SPEAKER_04]: the ancient petroglyphs, but also some
items and stuff that you guys would not
[SPEAKER_04]: take, you'd leave it there because that's
where it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and and leaving nothing, not even
footprints behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was wondering if you could talk a
little bit about the spiritual aspect of
[SPEAKER_04]: Mad Jag Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we first started exploring it,
I started from the bottom up where it
[SPEAKER_00]: flowed into another canyon, which flowed
into another canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I first met a mountain lion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a jaguar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we came up with the term, you know,
mad jag that I had come upon because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was screeching at me in the dark when I
was trying to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that canyon, when we got further up
the canyon and found these spots,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started finding boulders just covered
with pictograph, I mean, petroglyphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 15 minutes, that rock that you had
a photo of, let's see, I'm going to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: find those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had we had a projectile point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these pieces of pottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just left them there like a little
little shrine or altar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we also found a cave across from our
garden the first year where I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: with that tall guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this cave was a those are
Colombians there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are all the ones that's as big
as they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was close to Thanksgiving,
this photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew huge, but they just they needed
to get into December in the tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the petroglyphs here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we did these costumes and things
thinking that someday we would do a movie,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that's why we were doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the I still have this little
arrowhead here, but we left all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pottery behind and.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a cave across from near our
first garden that had an arrow shaft in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a single yucca fiber moccasin that
the ancient people, you know, that made
[SPEAKER_00]: out of yucca fiber, and they were like
about half inch thick and had been chewed
[SPEAKER_00]: up a lot by a rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they were obviously in this
this cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just left them there as a little
museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them all on a rock together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't made it back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to go back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing we didn't do, which I
regret, but it could still happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: was take all of our old hoses out of the
canyon and the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tucked under the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went back in the 90s and the bear had
pulled a bunch of them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reburied them and pushed them back
under.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pump got hiked out ultimately by
someone who wanted to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy was a young stallion man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just strapped that sucker on a single
pack frame and hiked it out himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had taken it in two of us on a
pole, you know, between us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he just hiked it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it out, you can have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What year did that happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he knew you guys before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys told him about the pump
existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was this tall guy's mother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he he went in and.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came down, I think, at harvest time and
helped us a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He since left the planet, though he was
much younger than all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he he lived a rough and tumble life,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, he didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's the spiritual aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've slept right where he's sitting here a
few times next to the creek and listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: it flowing by at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the most fabulous thing in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talking about dark skies in 19,
you know, late 70s, the dark skies in
[SPEAKER_00]: northern Arizona were extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Flagstaff was the nearest place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've I've I spent 400 days out of my life
in the bottom of this canyon and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a year of my life, and it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it became like my
second home in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew for five years in this canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, it's been just quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We every once in a while, I'll go back and
go out on the rim and look down in and
[SPEAKER_00]: more people are driving in four wheel
drives and razors and little four by side
[SPEAKER_00]: by side vehicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're going out on all these
jeep trails and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't know what's down below
because they're not going to get out and
[SPEAKER_00]: hike down 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on a hunch and get down there and
they wouldn't find these alluvial
[SPEAKER_00]: plateaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buried, you know, so while magical place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 90 90 feet above the creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no trail that would even remotely
bump into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a special place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back there four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for this trail that a rancher had
made years ago that came down not far from
[SPEAKER_00]: this original garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't find the trailhead again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had grown over so much in 10 years that
when I was there last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunted all over, man, for hours and hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know where it goes down,
but I just couldn't find the trailhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it's in a forest fire area that has
still not been reopened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a fire that was over a year and
a half ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go talk to the forest
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to find out why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a feeling why is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about landslides or people
getting hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exposed so many architecture,
archaeological spots from the trees
[SPEAKER_00]: burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all this that there,
I think they're afraid of people going out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and plundering spots because it's
very human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A canyon next to this that was more used
and where the guys from Jerome were using
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen skulls just laying on the
surface where people had dug to burial
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, you know, ancient burial sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sad, but it goes on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raiders of the lost art.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did an article in Tempe in the early
80s about guys who would go out and just
[SPEAKER_00]: look for burial sites and dig them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Splendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them I knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got five years in prison because of,
you know, ancient grave robbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, ancient grave robbing is something
that's been going on for a long,
[SPEAKER_06]: long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they get they get sold on the private
market to collectors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the origin of, you know,
all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's definitely I mean, it's a shame
that it happens, but it seems like it goes
[SPEAKER_06]: on anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's ancient humanity that existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Egypt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Egypt would be Egypt would be one of
the primary sources.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we keep this conversation could
likely go in a million different
[SPEAKER_06]: directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have a feeling this is going to be
like a nine parter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would probably be more than just this
one part because we can't touch on
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the things I do want to touch
on is that one one thing that's like
[SPEAKER_06]: really interesting to Matt and I ourselves
is that, you know, some of these,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we got a little off topic on
Hayes and, you know, but some of this
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff with Hayes and Skunk One and some of
these American strains, a lot of us
[SPEAKER_06]: younger folk, our first like legitimate
history on them that we know of comes from
[SPEAKER_06]: when they made their way over to Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when they kind of became famous
and started getting bred with and started
[SPEAKER_06]: getting sold where people could hear about
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have people like Rob and Sam
and stuff like that who tell their story.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's very, you know, with historians
or whatever, it's always cool to get a
[SPEAKER_06]: different perspective from someone,
you know, an alternate source from the
[SPEAKER_06]: same era.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were talking before about how for
a minute there or for a year or two,
[SPEAKER_06]: you were Sam and Rob's biggest customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the sense that you bought, you bought
something like, if I remember correctly
[SPEAKER_06]: off the top of my head, something like
3000 Skunk One seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: $5,500.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that 1978 or 1979?
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said 79, 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the back of this, if you look at it
up close, it says that these were bred for
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1980 in 1980 for the 1981 season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still have this pack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was telling Raho yesterday,
some of the loads we got from the cartel
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mexico at a certain point in 1984,
roughly, 82 to 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would get, we moved our first load so
quickly that they sent us another load
[SPEAKER_00]: that wasn't meant for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had labels in it from someone in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got two or three of these labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you'd like to have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be glad to send them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, Sam wanted them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam collects them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has great collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, this one was, it was a Santa
Claus in a, in a wagon pulled by horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in a, it's a black and white label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got another one at a different
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was someone else's load,
but because we were moving them faster,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just sent it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a raccoon on the label and it
was from Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, it was, it was funny,
but these are, yeah, these are precious,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, little mementos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I went to Amsterdam in 1969,
right out of high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went on seven weeks to Europe with a
friend and that's the first place I tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the club, Paradiso and I
couldn't, I didn't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a big hit of, of something and I
coughed my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even get it in deep enough to
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to give you an idea of this guy was
selling a pound of, of Turkish weed for
[SPEAKER_00]: $15.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in a shoe box.
[SPEAKER_00]: A shoe box full was 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it was like a Turkish ham?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, it was probably, you know, like bagweed
from Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dark brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I bought my first chunk of hash
and I actually smuggled it back in 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was nervous as heck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't actually get high until later in
69 when I went to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I had that hash still
then or not, but Denver in 1969 had
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, you know, Panama red,
Colombian, Mexican, um, every sort of acid
[SPEAKER_00]: you could possibly want was being sold at
on the Hill and Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you have to do is drive over to
Boulder and hang out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it called Hippie Hill back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just called the Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the Hill and Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the next is near the university,
but it was this stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bookstore at the top where,
um, I actually saw Ellen Ginsburg reading
[SPEAKER_00]: the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was called Brillig works and Tulagi
on the Hill is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place where they have live music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bar with live music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw lightning Hopkins there and a few
other amazing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it opened and I think I have a photo
of it in my, um, Chronicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in 64 it opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was really a kid then,
but, um, so the, uh, what, what channel
[SPEAKER_00]: are we on now?
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I went, when I was going to
Boulder in the nineties, it, that Hill was
[SPEAKER_06]: still a place that you could go and buy
weed and acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had transformed and it was called,
it was called Hippie Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it was still a spot that you could
go and yeah, you could get, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously the wheat, the, the,
you know, the type of weed had changed,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the ability to go there and meet
someone and score a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and you know, the cops sort of
tolerated it and tolerated a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: trade going on there or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, it's, um, I didn't realize how
early that had started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because at that point, by the time
that I had been going, uh, which was the
[SPEAKER_06]: mid nineties, late nineties, it would have
been ongoing that then for 30 some years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but what the thread we were on is I
would love to know, and I'm sure Matt
[SPEAKER_06]: would too, what Rob or Sam told you about
their skunk one lines, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: aside from the descriptions and stuff like
that, like what they told you about what
[SPEAKER_06]: was in them or why they were excited about
them, what got you excited about them to
[SPEAKER_06]: buy so many and then what you're
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Experience was like actually growing them
in terms of like what they grew,
[SPEAKER_06]: like what they smelled, like were they
superior to the Mexicans you were growing
[SPEAKER_06]: anything like that would be probably
wonderful to chat about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I met Rob through high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, he wrote articles a few,
and at the end of the article,
[SPEAKER_00]: he always put something like, if you want
to, um, if you're interested in any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I wrote about are these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can contact me through the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote a letter to high times to Rob
and I put my phone number in there and he
[SPEAKER_00]: called me up and that's how we hooked up
because the, the first year I grew skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had already had two years, actually
three years of growing before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the year before I made enough money
that I could afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, when I saw and heard his description
and other people's of skunk number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went, this is what I want to grow
something that has a reputation and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these guys are breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't a book on botany for Christ
sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, he, um, I said, yeah, I want to
get 3000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two bucks a piece and he,
he knocked it down to 175 and he flew to
[SPEAKER_00]: Phoenix, deliver them to me because you're
not going to put that in the mail back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean put 500 in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he flew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met at the airport, sky Harbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drove him up to cottonwood where I lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stayed a few days and, um, I gave him
5,500 in cash and he was super happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure when he came up with,
he had this little zip case that he pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: out of his jacket and he had, he had
pre-rolled joints of tie, of Colombian,
[SPEAKER_00]: of Oaxacan, of skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had, and he was standing there and
he gave me one hit of something in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was laying on the floor after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just standing there talking
away, smoking the rest of the whole joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, Oh, but you've got to try
this ties, this time strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never, I, my friend in Scottsdale
who was, I mean, in Tempe, who was the
[SPEAKER_00]: dealer, he could smoke like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Colombian friend for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started smoking when he was seven in
Cali, Columbia, but my friend in Tempe,
[SPEAKER_00]: he would roll 10 hash joints, pin joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just crumbled up hash and smoke them in a
day's time in a hundred degree driving a
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just chain smoke hash joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rob, Rob was pretty much like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I don't remember him describing to
me what skunk was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what I read in high times that it
just the skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was going to be also have some
exotic strains in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original skunk number one didn't have
Indian, you know, the Kerala India in it
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just three countries, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian, Mexican, Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had smoked each of those
individually, but the fact that this was a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid that was so potent and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I had read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all those old high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the first high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the first black belt magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collect all kinds of weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And memorabilia, we'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Afghani number one, I did get a
few from him as a gift, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: from buying all the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because this says Afghani
Hindu Kush has she seeds on his label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet on the back, he says this is skunk
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have one of these envelopes with
Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of, you know, and he also has
in letters here extra early.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I was reading it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually is a description for a pure
Afghani is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the whole thing is a description for
a pure unadulterated Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it says skunk one right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These envelopes had two giant horse caps
with 50 seeds in each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were 100 seeds in two big gel,
I mean, cellulose caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he'd get 50 seeds in each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what happened to the
many, many of these very different people
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years wanted one and I gave him
one in my chair, I think my my UK partner
[SPEAKER_00]: still has several.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how else to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob came down to our garden once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when he said he was amazed that
we could grow out of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never seen Arizona plants, I don't think
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we averaged 6.8 ounces across our
entire garden per plant, which roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: almost a half a pound per plant,
which growing in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he said he was used to two,
three, four pound plants in Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California, you know, up in that black
soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a there's a there's a volume,
you know, thing to and like plant numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in Northern California,
I mean, some people went crazy,
[SPEAKER_06]: but a lot of times people tried to
maximize how much they could get per plant
[SPEAKER_06]: to not get, you know, so if they did get
in trouble in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_06]: it would be for less plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's way, way easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you get better weed growing up
six or seven or eight ounce plant versus a
[SPEAKER_06]: four or five or six pound plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But numbers did play a role, at least in
Northern California, where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were in very cold water country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they what what were the type of romans
that you got off the skunk one that first
[SPEAKER_06]: year you grew?
[SPEAKER_00]: It it was very it was very skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, the smell of a skunk when
you drive over it on the highway,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was that exact smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It we were we were stupefied by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we were when this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't smell like that growing so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you when it was harvested,
the flowers dried and you crush,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a flower and it was skunk smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty damn potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rolled a joint once and went to this
topless club called The Highlighter that
[SPEAKER_00]: we liked in Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the two of the dancers,
we went in in the ladies bathroom with two
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dancers and we each had one puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all before we got busted by another
dancer who came in and was in charge at
[SPEAKER_00]: night said, You guys have to get out of
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went and sat down the ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they had one puff each more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was they were these were New York
needles, we called them or pin joints
[SPEAKER_00]: where you had to really, you know,
just to get a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were sitting there and they came
out of the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walked around the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're laughing and they smiled at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they walked right into a table,
knocked it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the drinks went over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fell on the ground themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just sitting there laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they had never been that high in
their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out later that they were
scared almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in 1980 or 81, there was,
you know, we'd already smoked this since
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a beer from Santa
Barbara that was very piney and I've and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was Thai weed around and other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, this thing packed a
punch, really quite a punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how people would rate it
today compared to all these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dogs and all the other varieties that
people bred up to 35 percent THC or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they're at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you know, the entourage effect is
what counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total package, you know, the terpenes,
the bioflavonoids, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said that the test on an original
Afghani, I mean, skunk number one was it
[SPEAKER_00]: was only like 14 percent or 15 percent
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the stuff I like falls in between
eight to 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the other ingredients, the
terpenes, perhaps that skunky terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile and other things really add it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice to have another account
that isn't from Rob or Sam about skunk one
[SPEAKER_04]: having that same smell even back then,
because it's been heavily debated for a
[SPEAKER_04]: long time whether that was true,
that skunk one had that smell or if it
[SPEAKER_04]: never had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roadkill skunk, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because the stuff that got sold in
Europe, it sounds like Rob and Sam or
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe Sam only kept breeding away from
that aroma.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so eventually it became very floral,
very citrus, maybe a little cheese,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe some grapes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But people have been hunting for that
skunky smell in skunk seeds ever since.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet it seems like it existed in the
70s and the early 80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it kind of went away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he maybe they successfully bred it out
of the line entirely because people have
[SPEAKER_06]: really hunted through skunk one trying to
find recessives that are a throwback to
[SPEAKER_06]: what you just described.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I moved out to NorCal to grow for a
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was 1985.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I first arrived in Ukiah,
I had taken a Greyhound bus and my
[SPEAKER_01]: instructions were to meet my new partners
at the laundromat, which was near the
[SPEAKER_01]: airport and the bus station, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that part's a little fuzzy,
but I'll never forget, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: arriving in Ukiah, getting off the bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm walking towards the laundromat,
you know, following the instructions I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: been given, the entire town smelled like
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire town, I mean, everywhere I
walked and I had to wait for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after a while, I got bored.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was standing around waiting for my buddy
to drive down off the mountain and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pick me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walked around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole town smelled just like,
you know, roadkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people confuse the rotting
flesh, roadkill part with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, when a skunk gets hit on the side of
the road, you don't smell anything but the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about rotting anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that sulfurous, you know,
stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same plant that's been smashed,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I live about 15 minutes from, I can be in
Ukiah in about 15 minutes from my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you said 1885, that's the perfect- What
part of, where did you grow up in the
[SPEAKER_06]: first year?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember what part of Mendocino you
grew in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember where you were?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, 1985 was the influx, like the major,
major influx of indicas into that region.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, of course there were some,
you know, making their way bits and pieces
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the 70s and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 85 was like the smash year for
indicas, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Out in that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes sense a shitload of skunk
would be in that town.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the indicas that I grew in,
in 81 and 82 were from NorCal,
[SPEAKER_01]: from Ukiah and, you know, the towns around
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were picked up by a friend of
mine who was hitchhiking around there for
[SPEAKER_01]: like two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time he, you know, get picked
up, he would offer to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you like, hey, I've got some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to smoke one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody always said yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they said, you know, let's not smoke
yours here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in the glove compartment and let's,
let's smoke some of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd pull out the bag and it's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You roll it and we'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as he rolled, there were always a few
seeds in there and he'd ask him if he
[SPEAKER_01]: could keep them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my- Yeah, I mean, my first interaction
with indica was, you know, Christmas 81.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came back from California to visit and
he had a collection of like six different
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a story to go with each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was one that he called ranger
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had smoked this weed with a forest
ranger, like, and this guy had,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was, I swear it was, it was what I
think where Afghani number one came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very coarse, you know,
Afghani with kind of a candelabra style,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another one he called plane
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was on his way home.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, at SFO, he was walking through the
parking lot and there's a guy sitting in a
[SPEAKER_01]: Corvette convertible smoking weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he walked up and he gives him the
look, you know, and I don't know if he,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, held up his finger like,
Hey, can we smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy invited him to join him in the
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he got a couple of seeds
out of that encounter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also that turned out to be an F1 Thai
Afghani hybrid, which was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew what exactly what it was
because I had grown pure Thai the year
[SPEAKER_01]: before, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had these pure Afghanis and I had
this, I had pure Thai the year before and
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff was just right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 50, 50 cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I used to sit there and
make notes about, you know, I'd sit and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it and write down the effects and
the taste and compare it with other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still have the notebooks, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you first told me that you've kept
these notebooks, like on sense and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, man, this guy's going to be my
best friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just, it's, it's only a certain
type of people that really get this far
[SPEAKER_04]: into weed, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I, a lot of us think it has
something to do with being on the
[SPEAKER_04]: spectrum, you know, because we,
we get so far into something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many people are just like, it's just
weed, smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: So much more.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the, one of the, one of the cool
parts about doing this, these chats that
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt and I do is like the realization that
like the vast majority of our history is
[SPEAKER_06]: oral, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very little of it is very little of
it is written down, you know, as people
[SPEAKER_06]: age.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was evidence, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, so there's all these cool
stories out there and there's all these
[SPEAKER_06]: bits and pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Matt had mentioned, there was great
debate, like was Sam and, and Rob lying
[SPEAKER_06]: about how skunky it was in the beginning?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, because by the time they
took skunk one to Amsterdam, it was fruity
[SPEAKER_06]: and citrusy and floral and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, these, these stories and
stuff from, from the region and what
[SPEAKER_06]: things were like, it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now people look at me and,
you know, I'm only in my mid forties,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but people think I'm old as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, they want to hear like my
stories from the nineties, but your guys
[SPEAKER_06]: stories from the seventies and eighties
are like a full generation beat before
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these old Madjag notebooks?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your handwriting is so much better
than mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just amazing that they lived through
the busts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friends with everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they made it through the busts,
like the butt, like when you guys did get
[SPEAKER_04]: busted, they didn't go after the notebooks
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so those affies came in and in like
1980, 81, not 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew, I grew mine in 81 and 82.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was the only one in practice,
you know, that anybody in, I knew that had
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That year, the very next year,
all of my friends had their own AFI,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That they'd gotten from different sources,
from wherever, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: 83, everybody had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was making its way around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was making its way around the country
probably through Deadhead, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dead shows and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you a question about that then.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the old heads have said that,
you know, have told me that like basically
[SPEAKER_06]: like Mendocino and Humboldt was almost
pure sativa and people really liked the
[SPEAKER_06]: buzz and the flavor and the effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said one of the big things that
drove Indica's popularity was when in 81,
[SPEAKER_06]: when they started flying helicopters in my
neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting something that would finish in
September or early October was a lot safer
[SPEAKER_06]: than something that took till Thanksgiving
and was this giant thing, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that started spreading it because
police pressure and hiding it and all that
[SPEAKER_06]: became more important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indica's were shorter and squatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people told me that they
didn't like the buzz as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you could, could you talk for a
minute about your experiences versus the
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexicans and the Thais and the Colombians
and all those you were growing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Versus like smoking Indica's at first and
like what the differences were and what
[SPEAKER_06]: your preferences were?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I mean, today what people
think of as Indica usually is some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid because there were pure Indica's
back then that had a very sedative effect
[SPEAKER_01]: without making your brain fuzzy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was calming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calming and peaceful and kind of dreamy,
but it didn't give you that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that, that just, you know,
the couch, what we, you know, couch walk
[SPEAKER_01]: is not just a body effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a stunned mental effect,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brain just kind of seizes up,
you know, it's like distortion on a,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a, on a guitar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to have that,
to have that body effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of what we experienced today,
but with that distortion, with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: with that fuzz comes, you know,
it's usually got a lot of power to it.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these pure AFI's would have,
would have actually been just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: this, just who slows it down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Peaceful, very high, amazing taste,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, just like pure hash tasted
exactly like hash, you know, and at its
[SPEAKER_01]: best, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without that, that, that inability to
think you might be slowed down,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you could still, you know,
follow a train of thought and eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with, and I think that, you know,
skunk as it originally existed before Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: got it and, and hybridized it and used the
name for the new thing that he created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was no longer what it, what it was
named after.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody can follow that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blueberry is the same to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to let you finish your thought,
but I'm going to, I'm going to come back
[SPEAKER_06]: to that, to a part of what you just said
in a moment, but, but please finish your
[SPEAKER_01]: thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you know, skunk was very,
was very Afghani dominant back when it
[SPEAKER_01]: first came out and it was, it hits you
like, like a, like a sledgehammer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mentally, it just stunned you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't think you, you were just,
you were just seized up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, what we think
about as Afghanis these days, Afis,
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicas, whatever, you know, the chem line
is definitely, you know, got hybridization
[SPEAKER_01]: going there with some kind of skunk,
which gives it, you know, a combination
[SPEAKER_01]: that the extra power and the mental kind
of sledgehammer that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So contrasting, you know, you,
you, you went into this with talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: what people used to grow up there in the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you were, as you were just talking
about it, I was picturing Jim Richardson's
[SPEAKER_01]: book, you know, since Amelia flowers,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the garden that he photographed in
there and took it through the phases of
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescence and documented it just so
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I first saw that book in,
I guess, 82 or 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my buddy had brought it back for me
and said that it was on every coffee table
[SPEAKER_01]: in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had the Big Sur Holoweed and Dolores
and all kinds of special plants in there
[SPEAKER_04]: that weren't labeled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people don't know that,
that that's the original Big Sur Holoweed
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Tripweed and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, NorCal had, had spent years,
you know, refining these imported sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: lines to turn them into things that would
finish in the season that they had there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, selective breeding for
quality and yield and, and, and finish
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know, things that would work in
the, in the environment you had there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, you had,
you had created something just as,
[SPEAKER_01]: just as special as anything from Hawaii,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As unique and special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those, those lines, I think the last
thing that we, you know, on the market
[SPEAKER_01]: today, if somebody would go out and look
for seeds that they could grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be similar to that,
or would at least give them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hint of what it used to be would be if
they could find a good early pearl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can still taste the Mexican in
there and the effects still have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an aphi thrown in there,
an aphi or two in the mixture of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different sativas, but,
but the sweet, Neville called it the
[SPEAKER_01]: awakened zing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's a, you know, when grown as,
as since a mill by a, by a gardener who
[SPEAKER_01]: loves what he's doing, you know,
small numbers and pampered and cared for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's so tasty and delicious that
there's hardly anything that can come
[SPEAKER_01]: close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a sucker for the silver Pearl still,
but I, you know, I really want early girl,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause that's one that I've never ran,
but early Pearl was a big favorite in San
[SPEAKER_04]: Diego too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, you know, early girl and
Pollyanna were, you know, from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that era and from that region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were some of the, some of those
early hybrids when, when the first aphi
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up and they said, well,
wow, this is the greatest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing a couple of these things in your
garden and never seeing anything like it
[SPEAKER_01]: and falling in love with the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing you're going to do is
you're going to say, I'm going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: this new thing, which is the best thing
ever and cross it with the best thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that I've spent the last 10 years
making.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly the first thing you're
going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Mendo, you kind of have till
Halloween or maybe the first week of
[SPEAKER_06]: November, if you get lucky of,
of a good chance of reasonably good
[SPEAKER_06]: weather and not too much rain,
and then the cold and the rain and the
[SPEAKER_06]: weather starts to turn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So breeding, breeding and Mendo and
Humboldt, you know, you kind of have to
[SPEAKER_06]: have some Halloween weed at the latest,
maybe some early November, but you really
[SPEAKER_06]: can't like trying to push things full
outside till Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets really dicey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very dicey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've made it through episode one,
because we're already hitting the two hour
[SPEAKER_04]: mark and it makes me stop the two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to get in any kind of plug you
guys want to get in before the end of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I definitely want to do an episode
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are up for it next week or
whenever it's convenient for you,
[SPEAKER_04]: both of you, that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've, I've enjoyed our chatting today
immensely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's been really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that it can continue maybe even off
channel a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a million things I could talk
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm intrigued at all of the memorabilia.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the experience I used to drool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Sam used to post on overgrown the
breeders breed, you know, the breeder
[SPEAKER_06]: segment back then in the forums,
a lot of those old school pictures and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff like that and art that would get
made with certain kinds of people's weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that that whole like, sort of like pre
marketing of anonymous growers was super
[SPEAKER_06]: neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just, so yeah, there's a million
directions we could go.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as Matt said, we only have four
minutes before it'll cut us off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Madjag, we have you at madjag.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else you'd like to talk
about before we're wrapping up anywhere
[SPEAKER_04]: people can contact you or get a hold of
you or any of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we have here?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Santa Marta gold crossed with
Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty much a good friend of mine
in California made the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's gotten good reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the name for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call it, Jim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I had a couple people test it
that I trust that smoke all day long,
[SPEAKER_00]: that live in Sedona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, what is it on a scale of
10?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said 9.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, good, I'll call it 9.3.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great name.
[SPEAKER_05]: 9.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of some fancy, you know,
airplane cookies or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next week, have any questions you
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have them ready.
I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my own little free screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got like I said, we have a pretty
free flowing thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it can head off in all kinds of
different directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes we get to pick up on threads
of things we hear and pull on that thread
[SPEAKER_06]: and hear more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And other times, there are definitely
things we didn't pull on that I would love
[SPEAKER_06]: to in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you have anything you want to get
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd just like to say, you know,
first of all, big, big props for your
[SPEAKER_01]: discord channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you guys threw us in there to
kind of organize and prepare for this
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your community there is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good people, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very responsive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a lot of good information
and knowledge up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just props, props to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for for letting us be part
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides that, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just into this for the love
and I'm looking forward to doing it the
[SPEAKER_01]: next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the hell out of both of you
for your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the love you've put into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's you guys are the reason that
we are here digging into the past while
[SPEAKER_04]: we're why we are doing what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for laying that foundation
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly mean that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can say from myself, while I love
talking about weed with different people,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm leaving this conversation particularly
excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I had a real good time
chatting about this, so it was very
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you both very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make the people out there jealous
and just say let's keep talking after
[SPEAKER_01]: after we finish the recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start the outro and then I'm
going to remove us from the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after it's done recording,
I'll pop us back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'm here.
