[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_01]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_01]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_02]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_01]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, here with my co-host,
Thousandfold, who's been absent for a few
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes while he takes care of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousand, where have you been?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's been going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been that long, but it feels
really long in the context of our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we're weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gone for a few weeks,
people are like, oh my God, he's been gone
[SPEAKER_00]: for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has he gone now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been maybe a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's been a month.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, life was just getting pretty
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two pretty major projects outside of
cannabis that were just totally consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't know you're a leading
actor behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a huge feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swedish soap opera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thankfully, one of those projects is
like winding up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could just feel like a mental space
kind of coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for a few weeks, I just couldn't
even think about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely appreciate Matt taking over
for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that Dan obviously came on for a
stream as well, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not last week's, but the week
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From when we're recording this currently,
it was two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime Dan comes on, it's always really
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a quick thinker and he's witty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just very easy to fire back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got to see a bit of it and his
kid's really funny as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the random insights into Dan's home
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chaos of home life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think otherwise... What was the
other thing I wanted to mention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have another... Within my growing,
I did have kind of a big fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wanting to do a little pollen chuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for my own personal project,
not a commercial thing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a blind selection,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as Matt knows, I wanted to do a
blueberry and cross and an api cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, blueberry and cross and api.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think partly because life was so
crazy already then, I was struggling just
[SPEAKER_00]: to...
[SPEAKER_00]: There were multiple points at which I
think I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Matt knows, I had some germination
difficulties with the blueberry and cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just didn't really think about
the fact that they were... Obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's quite an inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't really take the care that
should have warranted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bust balls about germinations and
how it should be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had another message with something
similar where I always say, wait until you
[SPEAKER_02]: get your first set of tree leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barely starting before you take them out
of the sterile environment before you put
[SPEAKER_02]: them in a medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that's super important because they
can get water through the top as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to just trying to get all through the
taproot when bacteria is invading the
[SPEAKER_02]: taproot and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone just had six seeds all start
and stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just a common thing to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of those things where if
you are just used to growing really new,
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively hybrid stock, then it's easy to
become complacent because you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, it's worked for me just about
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just keep doing it the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I kind of knew, of course,
especially because I'm on the show with
[SPEAKER_00]: you, that my approach, which was just soak
and then sow, is obviously not the most...
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're playing a probability game,
that's not what you would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to maximize your success,
that's not the approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the most convenient approach
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially as it relates to money,
too, like people buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you lose one out of a population
of 10, that's a tenth of the money you've
[SPEAKER_02]: invested gone now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two and then three in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was my first big lesson,
I think, for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of fun still at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't all just bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember messaging you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even getting to try, I think
there was one that was quite strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had carties, but its tap wasn't
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was quite interesting to look at
for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I just learned about different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Dan about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, oh, yeah, you could try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both of you were like,
yeah, you could try some rooting hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: on the little root to see if it does
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was definitely an interesting
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were so hard on yourself, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were so hard on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I hate it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a part of it, but yeah,
I don't like failing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like failing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do it quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was also just the added context
of like, I should have known a bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: than that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that hurt more than just the
failure was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we had just done the
germination episode before that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was stage one failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, I still got one special
girl out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was at least thinking, OK,
I salvaged it just.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't the end of my fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had like five or six appies up in
addition to the BBN cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened is that I found a
few males, what I call males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one that was definitely a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, oh, I've got this
other one that I think is a male in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems to like, again, quite fairly
arbitrary selection during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to smell better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be like a nice branching
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I threw the rest away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when it flowered,
it was not at all a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had no backups either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another huge lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just assume that your pre flower
identification is always right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least keep it back up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at that point, I remember looking
in looking in the grow space and being
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, my fucking God, like this whole
project is fucked now because of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like prejudging, like by branching and
stuff can be real tricky, especially with
[SPEAKER_02]: some lines that stretch real heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can look real male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I was looking at the pre
flowers, obviously, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just I thought I was I was kind
of like judging across the different males
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had, I guess, was something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, in my mind, I had like three
males and I was trying to make a call,
[SPEAKER_00]: but obviously not all male.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, obviously many obvious
lessons there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, taking more time to have
committed to one could have kept backups
[SPEAKER_00]: of the others with small space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think definitely the context being quite
stressed about it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of like hurrying to make a call
so that I could free up space and free up
[SPEAKER_00]: my own time being like, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get rid of all these plants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, overall, still really
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, of course, I still get to grow a
bunch of great plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get to flower out the appease,
get to flower out the BBX and the BBX I've
[SPEAKER_00]: kept as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got cuttings, so we'll get to go
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't keep the appease,
unfortunately, but I'm going to be I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: running already, bridging the good old
Mountain Dew, which is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have plenty of stock over there
now, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to thanks to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: High and lonesome blew up my mailbox.
Got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I get the blue IX in there for that
round or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they made yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this round.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's OK, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I got plenty of other blue stuff
that I want to look through, like the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: resin, you know, blue sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue bubble stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a couple of different versions
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some really nice berries coming out of
the blue bubbles, both of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Peaberry and the Blubbacush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe my next.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be what I do next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, this current or this upcoming
chart is hopefully going to be that BB in
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross Girl and an E.B.
[SPEAKER_00]: app email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure you don't want to just jump
into reversals before you even do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm like a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to add any more on any more
complexity to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make some seeds and just
like, yeah, like I said to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think privately, like just really want
to see what the process is actually like
[SPEAKER_00]: and go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think it's just one of those
things I think that you naturally want to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn as a grower after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's nothing more satisfying to
me than like having fully formed seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: buds as you pull them out, looking at the
maturity, seeing they're all mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I love that whole part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching new birth happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird how maternal instincts kick in
when it comes to seed breeding over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even especially on your first time,
too, though, like that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, maybe this kind of ties into
what we'll talk about a bit later on,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of reflecting on some of these
conversations that you and I have had with
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the older forum guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think one thing that reminds me of
when I hear them talk is it's nice to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that kind of feeling,
that magical feeling when you first
[SPEAKER_00]: started when you're new and how amazing it
all was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that like we lose that
completely, but it's easy to like forget,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, obviously pushing
yourself to do new new things is one way
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get that feeling back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, for me, like kind of make
seeds is going to be somewhat equivalent
[SPEAKER_00]: to me growing my first plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new completely new experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis burnout is a real thing,
like especially over decades time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be very, very serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get burned out pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is always good to keep it changing
and keep experiencing new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I won't, you know, I won't name
names, but you know, there's a mutual
[SPEAKER_00]: friend that we have who like, yeah,
just had a high time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you can see like how much
work it is, obviously, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: like to maintain, you know, that many
mothers or, you know, to try and do all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hats off to all of you who've been
doing this for, you know, you said
[SPEAKER_00]: decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, some of you have that is that
is the next level to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's hard, especially keeping moms
and shit, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get into that, it's like now
you're in it for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the other thing I was going to
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a couple of months ago,
like it was actually possible that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of doing a small overseas trip
this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For unrelated reasons, that's not
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, even trying to think in my mind,
like how to prepare for that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if I had, you know, what I would try
to save and how I would try to save it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like would I have to pass them to someone
else to take care of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would someone have to come into the house?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, obviously, these are known
problems that we all have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember one time I tried to do it using
something called blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for people that don't know,
they're little ceramic, like things that
[SPEAKER_02]: have a hole on top with the plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Connected to a piece of tubing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you set it in the like a bucket of
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You set the dripper end into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time, it's supposed to wick it up
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is, like, unless they're
weighted heavily, they'll just sit at the
[SPEAKER_02]: top and barely get any water into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that out the hard way one
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's so complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, yeah, I'll just run blue
mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen other people do that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, no, it can be more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've looked at that too, obviously,
as many of us have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the thing that freaks me out
is how long it would take, kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you were saying, really, just how long it
would take to test and calibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need weights on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd need to actually, like, figure it
out over quite a long period of time and
[SPEAKER_00]: then know that it will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't rush into it last second and just
wing it and hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even looking at it, I don't know why
they're not, like, sold weighted because
[SPEAKER_02]: they just bob on top and barely get any
water in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you need it, like, almost completely
immersed to get water in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not weighted heavily enough,
then it won't go into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: The design doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mean this is the, like,
reservoir side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense to me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some experienced BlueMet people
can chime in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave a comment below and tell me how I
screwed up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell those of us who are, like,
maybe vaguely interested as a contingency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how you would approach using
something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, speaking of burnout,
it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, part of the break was actually
being able to get out of the city just for
[SPEAKER_00]: a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the parts here and it was fine for
a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God for Pete, for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't do Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice just to be away for a few
days and just, like, have a change of
[SPEAKER_00]: scenery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in fact, when you and Dan were
doing the live, I was on the road and Dan
[SPEAKER_00]: was messaging me being like, where's Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, should I cancel it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I woke up, like, last minute or
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you guys started.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys started maybe,
like, 10 or 15 minutes off the mark,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to be on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the last time you were on the
road, Matt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I was on the road was just for
that last trip where I was all sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for the last party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean, technically, like a few weeks
ago when I went out and DJed out the
[SPEAKER_02]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so fucking hungover.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't drink anymore, ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a beer here or there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone busted out peanut butter whiskey,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ended me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like pictures out there of me
snoring in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that sounds like it would be nice
for like a couple of shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get kind of sick of that,
or does it like, is it OK to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was delicious to be sweet and
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude, Steve, he had like a parka and
like because it was a scooter rally out in
[SPEAKER_02]: the mountains for like Vespas and
Lambretta's and old mod culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's wearing his parka and he
opened it up and he had like all these
[SPEAKER_02]: little like airport whiskey bottles of all
these different types.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, so he's like, here,
try this peanut butter whiskey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a sip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had already drank some beer earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was just the end of me pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was the last one standing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to get everyone to still drink with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's no way I could like I
haven't I haven't really had a drink in a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if I were to have like a
night, I would be fucked for ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, it took me I think I slept for
like two days after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just so hungover, so hungover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least there was a change of scenery,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice to see those people as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a DJ gig the next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going Underground Records here opened up
their new location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my best friends that I used to
be in a band with owns it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did a DJ gig there the next
following week.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice seeing everybody, like all the
old homies show up over just playing
[SPEAKER_02]: music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that sounds nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I don't really like DJing
too much, especially don't like being
[SPEAKER_02]: called the DJ, because it has all that
connotation with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like playing music, forcing people
to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to the music that I like is my
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, and it's a great service for
those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some punk rock down the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think for me, that was I
think that that's like the summary of my
[SPEAKER_00]: time away, ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I think today's episode will
be a bit more of a rambly one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few different like many topics
to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, yeah, we're going to talk
about well, Matt mostly is going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the upcoming rescheduling of
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll maybe reflect a bit on like
the forum episodes, some of the releases,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether Matt and I are excited about any
shows coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have a bit of a like
community question that we can dig into to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just a chill one today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Matt, do you want to tell us about
the whole rescheduling thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, like, first off,
it took me a while to look into because my
[SPEAKER_02]: immediate reaction when I hear about a law
being passed that isn't voted on,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, OK, who lobbied for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What money went into it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're not voting on it,
they don't do anything to give us more
[SPEAKER_02]: like rights on their own just for the good
of their just out of the goodness of their
[SPEAKER_02]: heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't happen with our government or
in politics ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know you didn't vote on it,
you know, but let's let's reschedule this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's always a reason
behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always have agendas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: How it works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't really look into it much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did, you know, enough people were
asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, I guess I should kind of
look into this, you know, instead of just
[SPEAKER_02]: being skeptical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like it's going to pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember how long it's going to
take to pass, but it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: passed yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There there's like a 30 to 60 day window
for people to like write in and like the
[SPEAKER_02]: DEA to comment on it and all kinds of
other weird shit that goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have different Republican
senators chiming in on it, Democrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing I saw about an hour ago,
they they tweeted out that the DEA didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: sign off on it, which was interesting,
and they don't know quite the
[SPEAKER_02]: implications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the DEA not signing off on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of an unknown right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there something about the director?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't been there or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a headline, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the thing, it said they don't know if
it was like a stance of them not showing
[SPEAKER_02]: up to not sign off on it as like a fuck
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if it was just like a matter of someone
not being there, but it wasn't signed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Signed off on by the DEA, which leaves
room for a lot of pushback from the DEA if
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can always be an issue,
always.
[SPEAKER_02]: As they've always been, because that's
what keeps them alive is drug,
[SPEAKER_02]: drug war money, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, OK, if it were to if it were
to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So assuming it does go through,
like what do you see its impact being
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe safe for like maybe start with like
people like you, man, like how how might
[SPEAKER_00]: it impact someone like you who's like,
you know, it wouldn't succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from my level of seed sales,
it wouldn't affect me at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not changing plant counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not changing the ability to accept
credit cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not changing anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some kind of banking bill that's
slightly altered by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like this all goes back to licenses,
licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the banking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge part of why the cannabis
industry is having issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some IRS statute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it only changes it to the
point of where you can like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Report like lights as taxable stuff,
you know, like if you buy lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can report that as a write off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess that wasn't a thing before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I don't ever, you know,
write weed stuff off because it just seems
[SPEAKER_02]: like playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been interesting to hear like the
different political avenues since,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're a a Democrat and
Republican only country.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a quote from a Republican
senator here that said marijuana is a
[SPEAKER_02]: gateway drug and Democrats move to
legalize reflects pro criminal
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-American policies that will stimulate
more crime on American streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also argued that cannabis banking
legislation facilitates an entire
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure and an ecosystem for more
drug usage in America, which very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very 1970s, 1960s type rhetoric,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that's to be expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't quite understand the
Republican Democrat divide on this because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're both so money hungry for taxes,
even though Republicans say they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're as money hungry as the
Democratic side is for taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be an obvious thing for their
voter base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Played to what they perceive their voting
base, you know, their values to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, trying to make a bit
more of a show of it, but ultimately maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: still being like, no, it's going to be
great for for the taxes or like our I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing I also read was that
they wouldn't be able to it would take
[SPEAKER_02]: like light speed, unprecedented quickness
for them to pass this before the next
[SPEAKER_02]: presidential election, which depending on
who's president next, if it's completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different administration, that could come
backfire and refold everything and make
[SPEAKER_02]: this a totally non issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, like I don't want to
sound like I'm saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Democrats are doing something progressive
for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that for one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think that they're doing it for
themselves, like for their own
[SPEAKER_02]: investments, for their, you know,
their sons and daughters who have these
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis companies that they're investing
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what I think this is all
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big money that's investing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not to benefit any small time grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not to benefit the people who have
been pushing for decriminalization or
[SPEAKER_02]: rescheduling all these years.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing that's going to benefit us
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe asking an obvious question,
but would it benefit like big industry
[SPEAKER_00]: players?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wouldn't be like like a collective
owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't benefit someone like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be big industry like like one of
the top six marijuana companies on earth,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They control a large share of the money
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure those companies, I'm sure their
stock prices have just skyrocketed since
[SPEAKER_00]: those announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a good quote too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see who it's by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sander Zagzebski, co-chair of Clark Hills
Cannabis Practice, whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Schedule three doesn't legalize weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it just means it has a medical
benefit and you can buy it with a
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: Said whoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sander Zagzebski of Clark Hills Cannabis
Practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But none of the providers of cannabis are
licensed pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not FDA regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, none of the recreational
folks are getting a prescription of any
[SPEAKER_02]: type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis is not going to be complying
with that regime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the immediate impact of rescheduling
will be that the IRS code section 280E
[SPEAKER_02]: will no longer apply to plant touching
state legal cannabis companies and they
[SPEAKER_02]: will be able to take normal business tax
deductions afforded to other industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like the main thing is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's write offs, tax write offs,
and that's what tells me it only affects
[SPEAKER_02]: like the major corporations that are
interested in that, and that's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: who is lobbied for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual consumers in terms of like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know criminality and what people
could be charged with.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So so far, they're not even like looking
into as far as I'm aware, like I was
[SPEAKER_02]: researching this, like making it reverse
charges of people already in jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was affecting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's disgusting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's and again, someone this is another
quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is simply ending the federal
prohibition on cannabis for all purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will still be up to states to decide
what legal what's legal within their
[SPEAKER_02]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still up to states to decide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your state's like a more anti
cannabis state, it's not really going to
[SPEAKER_02]: like mess with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you come back to the banking thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a bit more about the
banking thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's like a separate but
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like its own act, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how does it how would it be
affected by this rescheduling or how?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they like?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not it's supposed to be like
optics and say like, oh, this is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: look for future, like that they might
change that in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, it might lead them to
change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with that, like you have to have the
correct licenses and everything to even
[SPEAKER_02]: have that apply to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you have to be one of the
bigger companies that pays these big,
[SPEAKER_02]: big bucks to be able to play with banking
systems when this does happen in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just sounds like a bunch of Chad.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, from what I'm from what I'm hearing
from you, it seems like for most of us and
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the people who watch this show,
it's probably not going to change our
[SPEAKER_00]: lives or, you know, sorry, the Americans
who watch the show is not going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: their lives too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it does similar stuff to like
Prop 64 was telling everyone that it made
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis legal in California and people
just like, oh, cannabis is illegal in
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so advanced with its marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, well, everybody else is
like, going out of business because we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't compete with big corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it seems to me to be one of those
things where it's like we rescheduled,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're so progressive,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's cynical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always like very, very biased on
those takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just even looking at what like
non-biased takes are on it, they all are
[SPEAKER_02]: saying the same thing I'm getting from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's not going to change
anything unless you're a major player.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even going to necessarily go
in before the next presidential election,
[SPEAKER_02]: which could mean that it's a non it might
be a non-issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it'll get flipped off the second,
you know, another administration goes in
[SPEAKER_02]: if they do, which I don't even know what
to say about any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it was interesting to me
because the announcements came around the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time that Germany legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously that they're not the same at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, you know, there's a huge contrast
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Germany's one is like,
yeah, it's not full decriminalization
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like legalization in the sense that
like, you know, as an adult, you can carry
[SPEAKER_00]: up to X amount.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have X amount of plants like two
or three or something weird.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's wild to see people's reactions to
stuff like that in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like I mess around in the
UFO world a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was I was in a chat room over there
for a YouTube show and just a random guy
[SPEAKER_02]: in there was talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, congratulations to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis just legalized in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can grow one plant or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, oh, you don't even
realize, though, like you don't even know
[SPEAKER_02]: how bad this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a negative take on all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just see the fallout 10 years from
now that they're going to be like actual
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis producers, not just consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because consumers don't seem to ever
recognize the part that like how it
[SPEAKER_02]: affects the growers and will affect what
they get to smoke on the back end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to be fair to most consumers,
it's just like a black box, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really know much about what's
actually going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they can go buy and smoke,
they're happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, yeah, the producer aspect
of it, they don't get they're going to end
[SPEAKER_02]: up with Walmart weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try and explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like just OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the I'm looking at the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's if I'm not mistaken and someone
obviously feel free to correct me anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for an adult, they can carry up to 25
grams, which is about an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow up to three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about how much great breeding you
can get done with three plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are these like all the best
breeding that's been done?
[SPEAKER_02]: In our in the cannabis scene in America
has been done clandestine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not been done by these big industry
people selecting out of a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: something plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been home growers, you know,
but three plants makes it rough,
[SPEAKER_02]: makes it really rough to hybridize,
do any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, it is really complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I sometimes think if I were being
really optimistic, you could say that
[SPEAKER_00]: superficially it's going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, eventually that will lead
to something better than what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's rarely give back rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to me, it's just like they they don't
give back rights just to do it ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you let's like why when I see,
oh, we're rescheduling, even though you
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't vote on it, it wasn't like,
you know, a movement by the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not like who lobbied, who lobbied,
lobbied.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm so anti-lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most disgusting part of our
political system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than the fact there's only two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like two sides that can get into any kind
of office, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this all just reminds me as well
that down here, you know, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Democratic nation of Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had it's similar, like in terms
of its classification, it's a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's I think take it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called class a minute, you know,
alongside, like the harder stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, more or less the same class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys call it one to three,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably have A to C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A to C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a it was slightly different in that
we actually had a national a national
[SPEAKER_00]: referendum, a vote on whether to legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't I don't think there was ever
the option to decriminalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was only like legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's similar to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you'd have limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vote failed on like a knife edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knife edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a like maybe less than one
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people voted no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just really infuriating because
the government at the time still could
[SPEAKER_00]: have just passed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have done something,
but they just, you know, they just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: use that to cover their asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just like, yeah,
see, it's no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it seems likely that that kind of
opportunity won't come up again for
[SPEAKER_00]: another like decade, you know,
because there's nothing in it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I just think like
knowing that that's a place I'd like to
[SPEAKER_02]: move because that's where opportunity is
found in the bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is complicated because at the same
time, it's like I also it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who's just a consumer and feel
them feel things safer is hard to you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, that's kind of irreducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you know, you can't say that's a
bad thing for people who are just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is it is complex for us who are
like, yeah, on the other side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just it to me, it's my my passion
is breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it stifles breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it totally stifles it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's left up to corporate ag
cannabis, who know really not shit about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: To then take the genome further.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just completely stifles all like
like I said, everything all the best
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics out there have been made in black
market ops over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not been since since the legal
times, there hasn't been a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: advancement of breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, that's when we got the cookies
era.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like this is what we get now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, to me, it's it's proof and
evidence of its stifling breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it narrows things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because at the end, you're just
subject to the forces of capitalism,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, which I ultimately like
exploitative and just want to exploit the
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever type of product that
like seems to be the most successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all you're ever going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Canada, what I've been talking
about, like my friends up there tell me is
[SPEAKER_02]: that the the people who do the buying of
seeds for the government that are allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: to be sold aren't even cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have people choosing what genetics
go for or forward that probably don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke or have any interest in why these
are the genetics are choosing to go
[SPEAKER_02]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how they determine that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a crapshoot or a monkey throwing
shit, you know, like, yeah, it just blows
[SPEAKER_02]: my mind how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, anything else like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never rely on politicians for my job
or career or my passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've tried to make this such a
nonissue for how I exist and live that I
[SPEAKER_02]: could give less of a fuck what's going on
in the political world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't affect me in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon my French.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's pretty it's it's very it's very
discouraging to witness like the more you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about how those games work and the
lobbying and everything, it is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: bleak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for those of us who live outside of
the U.S., like obviously everyone we know
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to kind of like watch what's going
on for you guys, because it it does have
[SPEAKER_00]: like consequences for the rest of us,
especially those countries.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, Germany as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two, you know, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Germany making moves is something that
we have to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still still pretty disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have any other opinions,
please weigh in in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously like quite a, you know,
quite a thorny issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I like if I'm being a little bit
even more skeptical, I'd wonder if they
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up the scheduling shit during this
particular time in the world with the
[SPEAKER_02]: chaos going on, like be like a highlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a distraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like people are wondering why
Democrats and Republicans are aligning so
[SPEAKER_02]: hard on a specific issue together and they
don't on anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden it's like,
OK, let's bring up a reason to fight
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think about the wars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, man, is there anything else you want
to say on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just just people do your research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I didn't even do research much
until recently for this, but use common
[SPEAKER_02]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're giving you something you didn't
ask for and it's the people who take money
[SPEAKER_02]: from you in taxes, ask questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just assume it's for the benefit of
the people, because it's usually not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my best advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like as, you know, citizens under
such governments, you just hope that the
[SPEAKER_00]: interests happen to align with yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's literally it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a vertical vote at politics locally
and hope to affect stuff in your state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's that old quote,
all politics is local.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a real thing, you know,
but even then it's just who wants to get
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in fucking politics anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate politicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, it's a freaky looking game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is bad enough, bro, and political
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is worse?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ufology might be worse than all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, shall we move on to our like a
midseason recap?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I talked a bit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not like going to get into like
very, very specific reflections or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of I was my prompt from that
was like we had a bit of a theme this
[SPEAKER_00]: season, which is talking to people who
were involved in the forums from quite
[SPEAKER_00]: early on, whether that's kind of cabana
crews, the two of them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Demands crew and then Kirby's crew and
then maybe not crews like those two
[SPEAKER_00]: generations generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had Sabra on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think I think my prompt from that
was like, you know, do you have any like
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very broad like feelings,
reflections after hearing some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: like didn't make you think about your own
time in that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had Sasa on the forums,
you know, whether it's like what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, what the culture was like for
them versus for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, yeah, start wherever I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, well, let's start with the can of
cabana episodes like the man skitty Howie,
[SPEAKER_02]: their generation was the generation before
mine on the forums, like before I started
[SPEAKER_02]: getting really involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was it was things like that for me,
like, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you're always a treat to hear when
people that came before me were integrally
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in stuff that I was involved in
later, and hearing like different is not
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's literal or not if things
passed down correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get to hear all these stories about
how other things happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, like that those are some
of my favorite shows to do is interviewing
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who came before me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just as passionate about like
seeds and genetics as I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of stuff that really,
really, really interests me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it also when I hear them and their
stories, it obviously makes me imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: what it would have been like to have been
them where it was like an absolutely new
[SPEAKER_00]: frontier of like, yeah, communicating
about the stuff and just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uncharted territory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I did a pass cuts around and
hold them and get them out to people on
[SPEAKER_02]: forums and stuff like that wasn't being
done before these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, there were small pockets like
the 77 crew and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally speaking, that generation of
guys, it really wasn't being done like
[SPEAKER_02]: that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really, really built the whole
industry as it was to carry on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will say one more thing is that,
like, for me, like one of the feeling I
[SPEAKER_00]: did feel some jealousy, right,
in the sense that obviously not the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that there were no politics, but the
politics back then were very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't it definitely seemed like
not every action was so weighted or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know how you would put
it, but they definitely it felt like they
[SPEAKER_00]: were much freer to do whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pass things around to whoever share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like people weren't as precious as
they are or might be now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, into the Kirby episodes,
those those were my era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was active during that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this goes on to the subrob era.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a little bit before me,
but then our times kind of coincided even
[SPEAKER_02]: down to me being in the San Diego's
finest, you know, threads with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one thing I noticed the most
probably in the in the my generation
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes, my my experience from other
people's experiences in the forum is
[SPEAKER_02]: always so vastly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I came in trying to be the figurative
pipe bomb for the industry in my mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: like seeing everything I don't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing all the corruption and just
wanting to like cause chaos and it started
[SPEAKER_02]: over, you know, like this needs to be
broken and rebuilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much corruption just inherently
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a revolution of sorts,
like I'm an idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I really thought I could do this
shit, you know, in doing that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was banned from every forum that existed
at some point other than my own,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think there was any that I
didn't have some sort of temporary ban
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while these guys are, you know,
like, we had a lot of camaraderie and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff on the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some of that, but not a ton,
like not a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very much a rogue element.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's interesting to hear other
people that have had those experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I had friends that were like
really well liked on the forums and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was always a joke because I was the
most hated guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like trying to associate with that was
always really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was, of course, there's going
to be some jealousy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would have liked to have had that
camaraderie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't necessarily fill that with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you and at that time, if you spoke
up against anyone that was a big name and
[SPEAKER_02]: even asked hard questions, even
respectfully hard questions, you were just
[SPEAKER_02]: met with derision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you're banned from a place,
everybody's like, why do you get banned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Must be a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just carries on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seem to get banned more and more if
everybody's banned real bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's one downside of that
time, which is that people were very like
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a lot more for like a bit of term
like feudal, like hierarchical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was these little like,
not enclaves, but little like tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were out, you were out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've talked about it before on the
forums during my era that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, versus like the D man era,
there was one main heaven stairway seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank where you got to go do this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Overgrow was attached to
that forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: But during my era, every single forum had
a seed bank attached to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in doing that, if you spoke up against
any of those breeders on there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're exnate and blacklisted from that
forum, and all, you know, like all the
[SPEAKER_02]: dick writers that go along with at on each
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's that that is a main
difference, I think, between those two
[SPEAKER_02]: errors, how hard it would be to
assimilate, it would have been much easier
[SPEAKER_02]: to assimilate during the man's era,
say, versus what Kirby was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, I mean, on that note,
like, did you have any thoughts about
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more on the side of like genetics
provenance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, were there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have thoughts on like,
you know, how different was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that each of these groups were
growing to what you were maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even just between themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any like new was any new
information that came to light in any of
[SPEAKER_00]: those conversations?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there was new information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to go back and re listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but like, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I demand screw era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of Brothers Grimm, we hear that non
stop from that era.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dutch flowers, we talked about Dutch
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some new info that I could put out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch flowers, they weren't a Dutch,
they weren't a Dutch seed company,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're called Dutch flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were ran, they were sold on
heaven stairway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were making like, you know,
like they put them on auction on seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bay for like CBA, but like, you know,
1000 a pack, which was ridiculous for back
[SPEAKER_02]: then, like ridiculous, but it would be,
you know, bit up, bit up, bit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always had this theory that,
and it was, I think it started through
[SPEAKER_02]: reefer man, which is like the worst source
on earth for information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I first spoke to him,
I asked him who ran Dutch flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's always fascinated me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this company that had like the
first hype seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, Oh, yeah, that was
Calriesian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, well, you know,
I worked with them a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I, I knew what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my old buddy, Jojo would make
seeds and send them into heaven stairway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking back, I would see that they
would come out and be released under Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was also kind of interesting,
but I didn't know if like, he was just
[SPEAKER_02]: sending in reproductions for free at that
time or how it was working.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was talking to D man,
he came to the same conclusion separately
[SPEAKER_02]: on his own about Calriesian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not his real last name,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so you guys know, I'm not doxing him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our RC, Richard Calriesian.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always seemed to be like really,
really nice copywriting, like the best for
[SPEAKER_02]: its time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this stream will be blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came got its name because of blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always really well spelled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always sounded really good, like the metal
haze, because we grew with this metallic
[SPEAKER_02]: taste, you know, like all these different
facets, chocolate chips, so chocolatey
[SPEAKER_02]: with the chocolate tie and indigo diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, yeah, it was always so
appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even even during my era, going back and
reading that they always had the best
[SPEAKER_02]: copywriting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what Calriesian was
known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you mentioning specifically how
good the marketing, the writing was,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is phenomenal, like legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I probably use asked, tried to
incorporate aspects of that in my own,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like in in trying to describe as best
I can when I'm selling something,
[SPEAKER_02]: my experience with it based on reading
those and being like, oh, because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying this, this and this, I feel like I
can get this, this and this from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that appeals to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I've tried to be more accurate
about it, because their shit was not
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like looking back after being able to grow
a bunch of Dutch flower stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: like chocolate trip wasn't chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more like C99, you know,
like shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's one of those parts of
history.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to really, really pull the thread
on is RC and his his business,
[SPEAKER_02]: because seven stairway was so legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's still out there, you know,
like the guy's still out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know where he works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be nice to interview him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, because he went through so such
a big process with the courts and shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that dude has PTSD from it
all, or if he even wants to speak on
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great if he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody knows him, you know,
you can always show him the show and tell
[SPEAKER_02]: him to reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of those white whales,
like figuring out the RC story versus
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And overall, the heaven stairway story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually remember you talking about RC,
like, quite a long time ago on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: before I started and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, like he said, maybe that
was our Oh, he's the other good,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's the other amazing, amazing
writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, from high times back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that dude so far is still alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really old, but like, I would kill to
interview him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've gotten no response, no interest,
no nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I've written him letters,
emails, I've tweeted at him, I see him
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's looking at his tweet, his Twitter,
but like, yeah, I can't get anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two are some of the bigger white
whales.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the other are the other RC
Rob Clark, the other RC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will say less about that for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three white whales though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sorry, this is a tangent,
complete tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll come back to the forum
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just thinking about copyright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we fucked now with Chad GPT?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the white label companies is
going to start using AI to write all their
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, really generic
descriptions of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think like, pictures for plants are
soon to be fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can just have a picture you can't
back research and see that someone stole
[SPEAKER_02]: this picture from someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can have it completely made up by
AI.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you have this new strain,
even though the seeds may not look like
[SPEAKER_02]: that at all when you grow them out,
but like as a presentation to put a
[SPEAKER_02]: picture up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I think that's going to be
fucked with that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's going to be hard to tell who's
lying, who's not unless you're a good
[SPEAKER_02]: grower, grow them out, can, you know,
have data points to show, oh, this isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: even like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy's a fucking dumbass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it can be a lot of that
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be like a topic for another
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What AI means for marketing and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I'd rather not have a
picture than use a fake picture like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's just promises.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually misleading as opposed to
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to, back to the forum stuff for a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about when, what about talking to sub
Rob?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause obviously that one, you know,
that San Diego that's local to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you feel about those, those talks?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the sub Robin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been friends for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like me and him have talks about life and
just everything in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get along so well on every level,
politically, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we just see the world in various
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar ways during the San Diego's finest
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the only person that was nice to me
in that fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no one liked me there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they just did not like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I'm kind of grading.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get that, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I would have liked to have been more
involved in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember at the time feeling like,
like I should have been more involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but I felt like I wasn't allowed to be
more involved in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I did learn that I wasn't aware,
like, cause I was kind of friends with
[SPEAKER_02]: ape, like during those years, uh,
G as we referred to him, ape and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, buying tons of clones off him.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the clones, me and Rob are
running it during those years with the
[SPEAKER_02]: same exact clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know, uh, that, that he was a
major influence, like one of the main
[SPEAKER_02]: influences on San Diego's finest popping
up to showcase the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out ape again.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the guy who, who made sure I had
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really early on and a cherry pie and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, always been super, super good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even in my, like brief forays
through that, through those threads,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you could tell he was like a hub,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write that down by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit up ape.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might as well have him on, see if we
can get him on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a great speaker too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really intelligent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it'd be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what about the plants that some Rob
talked about, like most of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: were they mostly familiar to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're local or all of them,
all of them were familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what was really cool about
that was like, when you have these strings
[SPEAKER_02]: from your local area that you're very
familiar with, or that are like legendary
[SPEAKER_02]: and you grow up thinking about those or,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're big in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that builds camaraderie as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, the bull rider, the one that
like, by the time I got down there,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like just this mystery,
you know, like anything about it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: mystery, but Afghani bull rider was down
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and of course me and Rob,
like kind of had differing opinions on
[SPEAKER_02]: the, uh, the release of the Afghani bull
rider, but you know, I had a lot more info
[SPEAKER_02]: on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the back info on, uh, the particular
person we were referring to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's always going to happen,
you know, like especially in crews,
[SPEAKER_02]: like he's going to like someone that I
don't or be, be Luke, at least like,
[SPEAKER_02]: not know as much about someone as I do,
or have as much to say about someone as I
[SPEAKER_02]: do different experiences that happens a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, that, that tends to happen when
I talk to people that were around during a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain era, I'm like, fuck that guy,
you know, like, what do you mean he's
[SPEAKER_02]: okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I didn't get the chance to ask
him in that first episode was like what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to those, that group of people
now or whether he's still in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: them or he still does stuff with them or,
um, like one of the main guys was a guy
[SPEAKER_02]: named Grayskull.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm still in touch with Grayskull
too, but he's moved on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think from cannabis now, finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, I'll keep it vague on that,
but yeah, he's a great dude though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, all those guys still talk to
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're all still really close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grotech, sub Rob, um, Spicoli,
Sean Cron, um, all those guys are still
[SPEAKER_02]: really tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's more, there's more,
sorry guys, if I didn't name you,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, there's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Josie Wales, of course, no longer with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, he's a part of the Gorilla Glue
four, four crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Ross, same.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if, um, in those, in those shows,
it was, it was clear enough to some people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are newer, like that some of these
guys were actually directly involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the biggest, you know,
things that we have now, like Gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: Glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know one thing we wanted to cover that
we didn't get to was talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, HPLV and the fact that like on San
Diego's finest, that was one of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: times it had popped up, like people
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was grayskull talking about the
sour, no, the gorilla glue floor,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, or sour dub one of the two,
um, being quote unquote dutted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was one of the first times it was
ever brought up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later talking to two me and a few
other places, it sounds like sour dub was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually patient zero, according to
everything they've backtraced that that
[SPEAKER_02]: might be where this weird as however it
was introduced from hops was onto the sour
[SPEAKER_02]: dub plant and then distributed,
maybe not at the beginning of sour dub,
[SPEAKER_00]: but later on, you know, I wonder if it's
possible as well that there were multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: patients zeros in different places at a
point, or there literally was just one
[SPEAKER_00]: single point of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I yeah, I don't know enough about these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just seems like such a random
thing to bring a, uh, something over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say, as I was reading through
those threads, it was really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of like see them talk about it
without, of course, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: without the context that we have now,
and it's almost like fucking, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like, uh, it's like a flashback in a
movie or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, you're seeing the like origin
of some villain or something like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people like the first thoughts
that, or what people were saying about,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, this like evil presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just like starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you need to go back to the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't send them the fucking info.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reply to that thread, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get it back into exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no build a wormhole.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I that's, that's a part we
didn't get to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that would be interesting to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Rob didn't want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can have one again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the other thing that popped up in
those threads that we didn't get to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to, I mean, speak to, although it's not
like the most exciting topic, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was the form cut appearing in those
threads?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, um, that was around the time
Ape got it to me, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, lumpy's lumpy had his big,
uh, um, read lumpy's flowers, lump status
[SPEAKER_02]: on, um, I see mag showcasing the cherry
pie and, and cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the first threads,
like just huge grows of forum and cherry
[SPEAKER_02]: pie that people got to see an animal
cookies too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, that was one of the first
times I saw it and really got to see like
[SPEAKER_00]: this weird unit in the same, did he post
those in the same thread or is it like his
[SPEAKER_00]: own?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if he started in San
Diego's finest, but I know they're up in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but he did have his own thread
called lump status flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or lumpy's GSC cherry pie or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but he was a part of the,
the SD's finest crew too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, one thing about going
through the San Diego's finest threads is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are a lot of pictures of old
plants in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I doubt that like you could,
like you, uh, if you searched on Google,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would find those pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like you'd have to actually go and
dig through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there's a lot still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was quite surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised that Rob pulled up the
super hog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was an old line that me and James
hog had worked on, like the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, hogs breath, uh, OG SoCal master
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like he texted me like, do you see
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was me posting in like,
I don't know, 2009 ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have the post right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking like, I haven't seen that in
a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally forgot about that strain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think I, it was maybe the,
I don't know if I'd seen pictures of the P
[SPEAKER_00]: 91 before that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I linked to those threads in the,
the sub Rob part two episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely encourage people who are
interested in that to go and like have a
[SPEAKER_00]: browse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like four, three or four,
three threads for the cuts one for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the, the finest cuts threads are
like, like two to 300 pages each.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to get through all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to like, um, quickly just
literally flip through all the pages,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be hard to intake all that info,
you know, in a city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I was, I was starting to just
ignore all the texts and just look at only
[SPEAKER_00]: the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even that was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would, that would still be intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like going back and trying to restudy and
reread that I was going to the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the stuff I was remembering,
I was just like, Oh, fuck this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you would have had like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting time going through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is there anything else on the forum
convos?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just, I'm excited to do more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know how much, leave a comment
below, uh, respond to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know how interesting,
interested people are in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, of course it's interesting to me
because I was a part of some of that and
[SPEAKER_02]: participated in it and, uh, had wild
experiences in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Met some of my best friends on earth,
you know, there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I don't know how interested the
audience is in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So leave a comment below and let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want more of stuff like that,
like genetic nerds coming on people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are nerdy as fuck, like I am about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you want more grow topics or what
you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Comment below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess that our audience is
now like, I wouldn't say divided,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're obviously going to be
different, um, groups within, within the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've got a whole bunch of new
people in through the growing episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, obviously a strong following
already from the beginning with the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, um, and like forum, uh,
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I'm, I'm also curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we had a way to like break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew like what proportion of people
like, not that it necessarily the only way
[SPEAKER_02]: we can is to get people to comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way we'll know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever going to fill out a fucking
survey or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't feel them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of get stoners to fill out soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gets trolled as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe the other stuff I was thinking
that we could just touch on even briefly
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, um, both the, some of the,
I know you've been talking about these
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, but you know, some of the drops
that have already happened and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming upcoming drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously it would be hard for us to
like, um, go over everything, but Matt,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there any like highlights for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the past few months we've had my
blueberry in cross drop that I'm super
[SPEAKER_02]: stoked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's where I feel like I'm happiest
with the blue work at from blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, essentially da shorts,
blue, blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm happiest with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like being able to release that,
um, we had high and lonesome stuff come
[SPEAKER_02]: out a bunch of his mango haze drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, his mango haze work, uh, is I'm stoked
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's one of my favorite haze lines,
uh, that Neville's haze probably,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and he made amazing crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, pack has another blue dream crossed a
drop still of reversals that haven't been
[SPEAKER_02]: announced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just recently had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I knew about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had one with the green crack blue
dream and a few others, um, the P 91,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, S one crossed a blue dream that just
cut stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we got to see some nice grows of all
that in the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, definitely join the Patreon if
you want to see like, uh, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: tester picks and, uh, what else do you
have them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, mad elite drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been trying to get Matt to drop
for five years at least, at least,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, I grew his seeds very early
on and I was just blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, not just by the seeds, but by the
human behind them, um, how good of a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew how, in order to do selections,
you have to be able to grow a plant to its
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimate potential to see what it's
capable of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because he's such a good grower,
his selections are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I got to see that by growing his
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the last five years, I've really
wanted to get him to get his stuff out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just a very, very much like a
Bodhi in a sense, like just very kind and
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't like drama.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally left the weed world because of
drama.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like too many people throughout negative
energy is just not into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he knew that releasing this might open
himself up to some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just wasn't into it at all,
but I'm very glad and thankful that he did
[SPEAKER_02]: it because there's going to be a lot of
really, really stoked people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, OG has been missing from our
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, I'm not missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in abundance for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then trying to find like really good
OG Kush in regular seed form became damn
[SPEAKER_02]: near impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had it in, in hybrid seed form with
blues and stuff, but I didn't really keep
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the OG OG stuff because it was
around so much back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nowadays people are really trying to
find that gassy, gassy cushy, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that pine soul, gassy just fuels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all this is in spades and it's
in regular seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can make crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like 26 seeds a pack,
you know, like he hooked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm, I'm over the moon about how
some of them up already, or are they like
[SPEAKER_00]: about to go up or?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all up and available.
[SPEAKER_00]: People stopped pestering you about when
they're going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have stopped that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's more like, when is he going
to restock?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one sold out in five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When's he going to restock?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still some left, but yeah,
it's, they, they went very fast,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the resurrection, which is the
line I've talked about the most,
[SPEAKER_02]: the chem 91, chem D I 95, because like the
reason it was called resurrection is
[SPEAKER_02]: because like he felt like, and I didn't
understand this until after I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's why you called it
resurrection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like chem 91, but just with the
turps turned up to, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just a ridiculous amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can smell all those, the back
smells that you'd smell in the clone of
[SPEAKER_02]: chem 91 that you'd be like, man,
that would be really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, a lot louder of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like all those scents
turned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it was like resurrecting that old
clone to be what those guys probably
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled when they first grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that line's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sold out like, I think even less
than five minutes, like minute,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was gone wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was stoked to get his cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, he got the message out and
people are definitely very, very eager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that guy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes me happy that he can,
cause the other thing was he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, nobody wants this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, for years I've been telling
him, dude, you don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise you, you'll be surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, like when things sold out,
he's like, God damn, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope, uh, H and L doesn't mind me
saying this, but I feel like H and L also
[SPEAKER_00]: has been like quite really like
self-deprecating about his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, why are you like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you so jaded?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the same time, I'm like,
I also know why you're so jaded,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's just very humble farmer guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's just him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Him and Matt Ali.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very, very similar in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, to be fair, like I know
what it's like to have been working in a
[SPEAKER_00]: space for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is easy to get like,
you know, disillusioned or like just feel
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit like meh about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: His attitude is more like, eh,
just seeds, you know, like that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think the mango hay stuff will
get a great reception.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm glad that most of the people
buying it aren't people buying off of hype
[SPEAKER_02]: too, cause mango haze isn't like something
super hyped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people that want to have a haze
experience that understand what a haze
[SPEAKER_02]: experience would it be and what it would
entail to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it would be long, lanky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to grow plenty of it to find a
keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: People understand that that are buying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I think that's super important
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like lines can be received well and,
or he'll receive based on who buys them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're not educated on haze and
you're buying it, you probably won't be
[SPEAKER_02]: stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm buying it for commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, and I hope I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to go check again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, you guys sent me so much
stuff, but I think he sent me dog shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, EB mango haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I haven't gotten that wrong,
but that, that seems kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also had freebies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was, uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what the female was,
but it was crossed a coffee and on black.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like an NL five haze vaguely remember,
but not, not precisely enough female side
[SPEAKER_02]: was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, like I remember looking and
going, fuck, these are the freebies that
[SPEAKER_02]: fire, fire, fire, fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys grow some and send Matt some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me some smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except Matt can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send me some in eight months
whenever it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed that you've, I mean,
at the same time, I gathered like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how bad it was, how bad it was that
this is what you're resorting to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was a miserable experience,
um, going through cannabinoid hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_02]: syndrome, but this is a miserable
experience because like, I, I have such
[SPEAKER_02]: bad anxiety all day and I really was using
cannabis to cope with that and dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it really, I don't know if it,
I, at the time I felt like it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: helping that much, but like looking back,
like being sober all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: it definitely made a difference and it
does, it's a major life change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember thinking like during the
time when I was going through all the
[SPEAKER_02]: throwing up shit and like thinking like,
you know, slowly coming to the conclusion
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe this is CHS and that I would
have to stop for at least like a month to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like thinking that, it would have to be
the last resort in my life to ever come to
[SPEAKER_02]: that point where I would quit smoking for
a month full to even find out just to find
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to do it from the jump and
never went back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I never read, you know, I don't know
it, but it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait till time's up and I can
start flooding my receptors again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe fewer devs when you come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not going to dab anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing I'm not going to do is
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really learned, like I have a hard time
as a, like a former addict and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an addict to a lot of different things
in my life, whether it's food or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how I spend my time or
interests, how OCD I get about stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't realize when I'm being compulsive
about stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like dabbing could be a real issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just not going to do it when I'm
able to smoke again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flour, I think it'll be fine with just
flour and won't have any more issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go through this whole process and
really do clean my receptors out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is there anything else you wanted to
highlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise we can move on to squirrels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to squirrels question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do you, so you have a read of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got the document on your
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, I'm not, I'm not a hundred
percent of on how to approach this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think how do you interpret this
question?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was asking me to break down how
scammers inflate generic terms over
[SPEAKER_02]: promising traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I've talked about this briefly
in different aspects, in different
[SPEAKER_02]: respects to different lines, many
different ways, but like he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, like ABC sour or haze and all
five three different lines that are
[SPEAKER_02]: notoriously hard for line breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to breed certain, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me rewind it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you have a line and you grow out
a thousand plants and only one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants has that expression and you grab
that plant to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you then cross it to something else,
you wouldn't expect to see 50% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: population to be that because in its own
population, it was recessive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very rare in the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it wasn't recessive, it was just very
rare occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's what he's
referring to and stuff like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: like haze itself has tons of different
expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So promising like a haze IBL is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would take many years of breeding a
haze in a certain direction because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a, a like one of the first poly hybrids
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like ABC, uh, a trait that isn't locked in
until you're in the F four generation,
[SPEAKER_02]: roughly F three, F four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're starting to see true breeding
traits of that, uh, ABC type, like having
[SPEAKER_02]: a one-off ABC hybrid would be more hard to
find that, you know, um, what else we got
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour now sour, I think can dominate in
looks more often than it does in Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour has a particular look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people see that they think because
it's very distinctive look, I've got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think we've got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think we got it for sure,
but that's just one trait out of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that comprises sour,
um, that burnt rubber nastiness that in
[SPEAKER_02]: sour, isn't necessarily going to show up
with that trait, the look trait every
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's kind of what he means by
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've seen a lot of sour,
different iterations of the generations
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatnot, but like in, um, for example,
karma sour, like there was a lot of just
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly OG in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like sour, but it was a lot of
OG Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and people really thought they had it,
you know, just cause it had to look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's what he's referring to
in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't even know if it's more of a
scammer thing as opposed to just like
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are behind the scenes,
making the seeds, don't know what the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're not growing on enough plants
to see that they haven't achieved what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're claiming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nor did they understand how genetics work
and having a rare expression pop up in a
[SPEAKER_02]: line, doesn't mean that they can cross it
once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that line is like half that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's, I think that's the
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a key framing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good summary statement of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I had a different,
maybe this is another way to ask you this
[SPEAKER_00]: question, which is like, if you were,
you know, uh, you're trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible as a breeder or seed seller,
um, knowing that like these things tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: be probabilistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's the best way to frame this kind
of information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause obviously you need to give people
some information, but you can also pretend
[SPEAKER_00]: that like, you know, absolutely what
they're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, you know, one of my initial
impulse is to say, well, you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one thing that I do see people
do is like present like a range,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A range of expressions and say,
okay, when, when I grew this out,
[SPEAKER_00]: when my testers grew this out,
we saw like, you know, some collection of
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possible traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's maybe one of the ways
you can approach it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other way is to use a true breeding
line as a parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will help a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if one of those parents is
very close to true breeding for several
[SPEAKER_02]: traits, I mean, that's why, again,
why I didn't move on from bonnet forever,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it, it's a true breeding line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it regularly and reliably kicks
blueberry turps and it has a very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: look, has specific resin pattern type that
it breeds true for.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sense that it, in almost everything
it's crossed to, it'll occur more
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly than its partner in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes it so you can say, okay,
you can expect to see very this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this, that, you know, like three different
main expressions that helps because it
[SPEAKER_02]: brings some accuracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other way, yeah, is to just
explain the different ranges, the
[SPEAKER_02]: different B B realistic about the
flowering times too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of people are not realistic
about flowering times whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we, did we not do a show where like,
we actually looked through like some seed
[SPEAKER_00]: websites just to see what the marketing
was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we actually record that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that like another time
we could like, we're going to pull up a
[SPEAKER_00]: website in the background and actually
show people who we're talking about just
[SPEAKER_00]: to like, you know, not rough too many
feathers and like maybe like just comment
[SPEAKER_00]: on like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that the information is being
framed stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be a nice experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be very funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have lots of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sure we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I have a memory of you and I
looking at say like Barney's farm website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we did that for just like a few
minutes of something, but not a full
[SPEAKER_02]: episode of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be interesting to go through,
like open up the attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go through the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually was, that would be a great
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comment below if you want us to do that,
because I'll take the heat and do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like I don't mind the major seed
banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too, you know, it's not too scary
because, you know, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: Walmart's attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they're a bunch of bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were bitches to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but it's not just even about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the breeders are caring,
though, like we'd be going over the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders are caring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, but I'm down to do it because
like everybody should be held accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Including myself, you know, people hold me
accountable all the time and ask me every
[SPEAKER_02]: question they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not everybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've talked about these ideas
before, like in a broader sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I think that we probably could do a
different kinds of reviews of like
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of cannabis content,
but I just haven't really thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: how to frame it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think it'd be very funny to do like
a strain hunters one, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't know how, you know,
practically I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comment down below if you want us to
review, I don't know, mainstream,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you'd call it mainstream cannabis
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'd be fun to do like on the,
on the Patreon discord to load it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: just have me talk over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I'm probably on the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would work on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were we talking about again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also it just reminds me that yeah,
like you said, we have approached this
[SPEAKER_00]: question in like many different ways,
I think in the past, like we had that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole episode on like white labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about it again with Pico white
labeling, that side of the marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about breeding in general and
like, how you look at it in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: probability and like, you know,
what a true breeding plant would do in a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project as opposed to something
that you have no clue about or like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, this is just the question,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is a question we just come back
to again and again, which is how do you,
[SPEAKER_00]: given the information that you have as a
consumer or buyer of seeds or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: like make decisions about what you're
buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to make a buy smarter episode,
which would be like going through the
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I, how would someone experienced go
through and pick seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're finding something specific,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think what we've done in the past
has looked at it from a breeding point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view, but not necessarily from the buyer's
point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, like a lot of what I was
doing early on was because I was also a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed buyer, not just a seed maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like people need to be
protected, like they're hard earned money,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like people are getting swindled
left and right, not just people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my friends were still getting
swindled at this point, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: still are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'd be nice to have something for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: For them to understand, like this is
something I take into account when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at seeds and seed buying from
someone this far in that's from the
[SPEAKER_02]: opposite side of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in, look at other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but I'm sure people would say,
I'm just a hater, you know, I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: hating on certain companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm jealous or something that I
realistically be, it'd be nice to do from
[SPEAKER_02]: a seed buying perspective to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have no, my current take on it
is that like, I just won't, there's no way
[SPEAKER_00]: we even consider buying anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just, if I don't know the person,
and I want to say, don't know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even mean like, I recognize their
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I haven't talked to them and
I don't know what they're about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to consider it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to ask questions and be
able to be relatable to these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at the end of the day, none of them
are rock stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it differently as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so much good work that can be
trusted or like good work from good people
[SPEAKER_00]: who can already be trusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you even like bother with
like, yeah, anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been screaming that from the rooftops
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, why even waste your money like
that when there's already good people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be rewarded for like
taking risks in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot good to find that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of signals that yeah,
maybe we do, we should do a show on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on that specifically, like the buyer's
journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And feel free to leave comments below.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have other show ideas and we'd like
to take them from our Patreon discord too.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people in there you can hang out
with, but feel free to leave show comments
[SPEAKER_02]: below too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's us for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we like can keep it pretty cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrap it up in a package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess you have anything else you want
to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't nice to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, feels very happy to have you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was very familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't hard at all to slot back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, nice to be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, um, go check out riotseeds
.com for all your seeds and spray needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have stuff to make feminize seeds.

his mega haystrap pack has his blue dream
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff up and his trade rec stuff up,
uh, mad elite seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still some left to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have my blueberry and cross drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Ms. Jill has her seeds up there.

[SPEAKER_02]: And when, like in other communities,
there's always trolls and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one handles itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pretty self leasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone doesn't fit in and they're just
being rude, and, and hurtful, they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: last long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought I'd see it grow to what it
has.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, a lot of that's a thousand cause
like it, it really, really turned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I'm proud of everyone there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, I think, isn't that it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I cover it?

[SPEAKER_00]: You, I think, uh, you'd say like Oceania,
but people don't know that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia, New Zealand needs, uh,
