[SPEAKER_00]: Where the wild things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep hearing Fang reference lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody talks about him this last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about it like three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire engines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a weird jazz butchery type LP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it because it was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why it got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a 7-inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was worth a bunch of money on a certain
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it real cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I checked it out and loved it.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gangrene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Generation X.

my writing and dressing and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Jesse Hector.
[SPEAKER_00]: The singer of the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make the claim that he really
brought a lot of rockabilly to England.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good portion of it was inspired by Jesse
Hector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can, there's a Jesse Hector CD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Teddy Boy Jesse Hector running wild
with a Message to the World DVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's still in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh it's not in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh there's a disc too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the discs is missing and there's a
DVD of Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought I might have to buy it again
because I don't think it's in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on there and it's a documentary about
Jesse Hector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really freaking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know about him, go check him
out.

Hector and his major contributions to punk
[SPEAKER_00]: rock and club rock.

Dragons that passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego's Dragons.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the dude in the far left.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah he was in a punk band called the
Dragons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to see the Dragons play right after
his funeral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ace Fraley showed up from Kiss and
played the Zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Zero showed up and they played
Dragon songs with the Dragons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was insane.

LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were also big inspirations on The
Descendants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know that.

[SPEAKER_00]: I want to party with JFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright and then we have Mad Garden EP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright and we get to Joy Division.

a metal section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't own metal records.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really like metal but Juggernaut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought this at a thrift store as a kid

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so I kept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a repressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Kleenex Lilyput.
[SPEAKER_00]: LP.

[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the LA Explosion?
[SPEAKER_00]: All this stuff's out of order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't stand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives me nuts when it's out of order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay I see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here's more Last.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're tired of Last.
[SPEAKER_00]: More Last.

[SPEAKER_00]: Last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Objections.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LA Explosion.

[SPEAKER_00]: The Milkshakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Billy Childish fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm a little bit obsessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be so hard to find in the US
back when I was collecting.

[SPEAKER_00]: The This is Mod comps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I chased it ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took, I mean I had eBay searches
going for years and stuff to find this Pop
[SPEAKER_00]: Rivets LP was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's still that hard but I
mean back then things were really hard to

[SPEAKER_00]: my bands played with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they signed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the Peanut Butters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call us the Peanut Butters because it
rhymed with nutters and like our singer

three shows with bands in the same night.
