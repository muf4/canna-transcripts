[SPEAKER_05]: Total gentleman's contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't enforce it, no way to do it,
but it's just a simple handshake deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the idea for this from another
YouTuber named Jesse on fire, and I felt
[SPEAKER_05]: like it was fair for him to ask,
so I figured I'd do the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honor system re-engaged in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_05]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_05]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_05]: Not-so-dog, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_05]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be part two of the Mad
Jag and Raho series, and of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: joined here by my friend, Not-so-dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peace, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, everybody, we really had a good
time recording the show last time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was probably the largest
response we've ever gotten for any show as
[SPEAKER_05]: far as the positivity that we received.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really, really resonated with a lot of
people, and yeah, I'm really excited to
[SPEAKER_05]: start with round two, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried to go in a more linear pattern,
and we covered some of the Canyon era,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I know after we recorded last time,
we spoke a little bit, and you have some
[SPEAKER_05]: notes and a good direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to let you go ahead and
start, Mad Jag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you want to start the tale?
[SPEAKER_02]: The 1978 map that I drew, it says OG,
stands for Original Garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the 1978 map.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to explain it a little bit and
break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the key is at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before skunk number one, this is the very
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a friend in Kauai who had
Oaxacan-Hawaiian crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the H10, H9, HK, and then we had
somehow a few Thai seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colombian came from my friend,
and they're the ones that on Thanksgiving
[SPEAKER_02]: while it was snowing above us on the rim
weren't even close to being finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the layout of that garden that
you showed photos of last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That blends in so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's surrounded by pine trees and lots of
heavy dark green brush.
[SPEAKER_02]: This garden was probably, I'm thinking,
100 feet long and 50 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the size.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from the old notebooks that you
have?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like at the time you were drawing this as
you were looking on, or how did it work?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just all of them every year I did one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was at the middle part of our canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The subsequent years, 79, 80, and 81 were
about two or three miles further up the
[SPEAKER_02]: canyon than this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one was closer to 1,800 feet down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a longer hike, more difficult,
and the others were anywhere from 14 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 1,600 feet down in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes a difference at the end of the
year, of course, when you're carrying your
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we did as much as possible down
inside the canyon later by having friends
[SPEAKER_02]: come down in and camp with us because it
wasn't feasible to carry out whole plants
[SPEAKER_02]: or branches or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you find that any of these grew any
different in these little microclimates in
[SPEAKER_05]: the canyon, like any of these strains from
between 78 and 79, if you moved or grew
[SPEAKER_05]: any of the same exact strains in different
little locations in the canyon,
[SPEAKER_05]: did you find any phenotypic variations?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just more the size and ripeness
because this particular garden got the sun
[SPEAKER_02]: east to west.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it had the most sun in 10, 11 hours at
some days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they grew much larger plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of these plants were 13,
14 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, my partner is six foot seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a photo of him reaching up in his
wizard outfit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: His reach is at nine feet and they're four
or five feet beyond his reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they were the Hawaiians H10 over
here where it says H10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right over in this region, H10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Far left of this photo or this drawing
where it says H10 and also in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: there, H10.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just massive plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was good smoke, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Oaxacan, again, crossed with
whatever they were calling Hawaiian,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has a Thai background just because
Hawaii probably in the 40s and 50s,
[SPEAKER_02]: people from the Far East that visited
there, it'd be very easy to see those
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of varieties showing up in another
tropical area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crazy magic because I used to,
you know, I drew a plot like this for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a map like this for just about
every outdoor plot I ever did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy to see, you know,
that two people on, you know, other sides
[SPEAKER_00]: of the country at the same time are doing
the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, beyond the fact that I did
it, yours is the level of detail and
[SPEAKER_00]: artistry is way beyond anything I ever
did, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I might want to ask,
just because I remember something you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned last time, which was basically
like you kind of averaged about six point
[SPEAKER_01]: eight or seven ounces a plant or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just heard you say that like
you had these nine to 13 foot tall plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: these giants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you could talk a little bit about
some of the different stuff that you grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was a nine foot or 10 foot tall plant only
giving you that amount of flower because
[SPEAKER_01]: of how loose it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have some that were a lot denser
and they were smaller plants, but yielded
[SPEAKER_01]: more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have old timers that would tell
me that back in the day, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would get ounces that were like the
size of my forearm just because the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't as dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm curious as to like,
was the six point eight ounces the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that happened in subsequent years when you
were doing like the skunk one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get a massive variance of weights
and sizes these first couple of years when
[SPEAKER_01]: you were experiencing them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: The six point eight ounces average across
the entire two gardens that we did later
[SPEAKER_02]: were all, almost all skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tallest plants were six,
seven, eight feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Hawaiian in this particular
drawing that were so tall, they were
[SPEAKER_02]: multi-pound plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have a scale at the time down in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the later years we brought a diagram
down, Ohaus, good old diagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would go up to two pounds, I think,
I forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this plant in particular, it was
obviously pounds of weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were tight buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't rock buds, you know,
like some, especially the ones I know of
[SPEAKER_02]: friends who grow heavily Indica
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those buds just get rock hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Density is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: These, a pound of this herb probably was
twice the size of the later skunk number
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skunk number one were denser,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a quick question that I've just
been, as going through the pictures and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, which wizard were you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which color?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all pointed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, did you?
[SPEAKER_02]: This was not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was my friend, Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six to seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light blue one was my UK partner that
you have in a photo where he's pointing
[SPEAKER_02]: off in, well, actually you used it in this
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pointing out into the distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: The garden is actually right below him,
but we had him pointing in a direction
[SPEAKER_02]: that wouldn't be as easy to figure out if
you got to that canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was never, I never wore the light
blue one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it was a smaller robe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a, oh, what is the one I'm
wearing?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one of me and my tall partner
walking across the rug.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the white one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you got it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the one in front.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can just see my beard back then
showing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ex-wife, my kid's mom, she's the one
who sewed these up for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: She made all of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that red bag there was particularly
colorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she was up with the idea, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know whatever happened to these
costumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't keep at least one around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think 45 years later, you know,
it's what really pulled me to your story
[SPEAKER_05]: when I first like I first, like I said,
heard about or even like found out what
[SPEAKER_05]: Madjag was going through Sam's old posts
and going through the kilo art.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kept seeing this really pretty kilo
art that said Madjag on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what started that journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I saw these pictures of the
robes is when I was like, these are my
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are my people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to find out who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That log right there that we're walking
across.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was camped on the side that this photo
was taken from.
[SPEAKER_02]: By our third friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And water was almost touching the bottom
of this this log.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to sit on it and scoot across
with a bag of weed in front of me and
[SPEAKER_02]: scoot across.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ran for like three days from this
massive fall storm like in October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a good thing that thing was
there, or else I would have been stuck on
[SPEAKER_02]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it was, I was in a silly old army
tent and in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water was had didn't have a built in
bottom and the water was flowing through
[SPEAKER_02]: the pouring rain and cut a trench around
it like you do in Boy Scouts to funnel the
[SPEAKER_02]: water away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a wilderness experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, MJ, you remember last week,
we were talking about how the how growing
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants kind of turns you into an
instant young entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inspiration, you know,
I've often wondered, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of what what were your
intentions, you know, when you guys came
[SPEAKER_00]: up with this whole Madjag branding idea
and started sending stuff into high times?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what was what was going through
your head when you were when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: starting that thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks it looks like, you know,
early viral marketing stuff is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, viral didn't even exist that term,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were inspired by High Times magazine,
by the Growers Guide and then later Robert
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark's book.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seemed like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make our own legend, you know,
and maybe someday we'll be doing a movie
[SPEAKER_02]: about it or it was it was kind of with
that in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that it would make us richer and
we would get paid more for the herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just it was set us apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we went and had labels made
the crack and peel labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be glad to send you guys some because
I've kept a lot of them over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they still work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would I would go through like an
airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I was going up the escalator
and I had one cracked and open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just slapped it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: It on the side of a paper magazine
dispenser in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my friends, the guy in Tempe,
his brother, who was a bigger dealer even
[SPEAKER_02]: than he said, did you put one of your
stickers in the airport in L.A.?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that reminds me so much of like early
skateboarding culture, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that was, you know, some of the
earliest kind of viral marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, viral marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that they that they pioneered
back then in skateboarding with
[SPEAKER_00]: skateboarder magazine, you know,
is is absolutely the foundation of of
[SPEAKER_00]: viral Internet marketing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, social media influencers,
all that stuff has roots going directly
[SPEAKER_00]: back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of that in your magic
stuff, too, Jim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a lot of that, like in the Hayes
poster, the cosmic boogie poster,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that's like why I chase that so
hard was because as a person who sells
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and has made that my passion
breeding and all that to me, that was the
[SPEAKER_05]: first time that I could find a physical,
tangible representation of something I
[SPEAKER_05]: could possess that was a perfect example
of the first strain marketing that I could
[SPEAKER_05]: find, you know, and and the magic label,
I put it in that same kind of category.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those early just things
striking imagery that you never forget.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was done so well, but I never
forgot it and always chased it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost it's almost like a pre-Reagan
era of freedom where everyone thought
[SPEAKER_01]: things were about to loosen up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were kind of loose for a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they went in a totally different
direction for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: More years.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these old posters that you
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found them a few times and I never
bought one, but there's an old poster
[SPEAKER_05]: where it's like they made them declaring
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we finally did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like prohibitions over and
posters, but they were just a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: too early.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 40 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'm curious about and like the
actual growing part of it is since it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds like you were basically this first
season, you were just collecting seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from friends and people you could get
access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the things that you liked and
disliked about the first crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did you look at those things when
you were trying to get away with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you were like, oh, my God, this 13 foot
plant is blowing past all the bushes and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else that we were trying to
contain it and like make it look like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do that giant again,
because it it makes me nervous or like
[SPEAKER_01]: what was the what were the thoughts there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously like this is the first
time that you were seeing a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what to expect, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just this is what Hawkin and this
is why and this is this and this is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like plant spacing and
how big they were going to get and what
[SPEAKER_01]: they were going to do was all kind of a
mystery, I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were I had had the one year before this
with my dealer friend from Tempe in a
[SPEAKER_02]: neighboring canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the first time I got a chance
to see plants actually reach harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were all Mexican strains,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the next over the next year,
the next year, we tried a garden in that
[SPEAKER_02]: canyon that was massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to get a we had to pump up 200 feet
to the alluvial plateau.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had found and it wasn't really smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good thing it failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a submersible pump that weighed
like 40 pounds and hosed going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first time we watered,
we laid a hose on the ground and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: went it disappeared into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it this party?
[SPEAKER_02]: We moved it another 50 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just made a hole and went down in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't flood irrigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so loose with boulders and stuff
below, even though it was this beautiful,
[SPEAKER_02]: smooth garden on top that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It it just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like dredging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the following year, we had
collected all these other seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: Thai, Colombian, and we and I knew from
that very first year how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just went on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: These the Colombian, though, that we had
no idea like we discovered that how long
[SPEAKER_02]: it took to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just knew it was super great weed that
we had smoked and we kept the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these on this garden, I'd say 30
percent of it failed because it was just
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the garden that's up here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing us the year you're speaking about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this one is 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's we were looking at the 78 earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the key at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one are you speaking about
currently?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one that I want to get the original
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1978.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so that's the one that 30 percent
failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by failed, you mean to mean just
didn't finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were huge plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one photo that he has from last
episode, they were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants in slightly different colors
because they were different Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the C10 here, C9, wherever the sea
shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were big, big plants that make it
easier to see right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I zoom out, it might be too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so eventually, did you just end up
having to chop them down?
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you just realized they weren't
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't they weren't real weed yet
and kind of composted them down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we took them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones that I had to scoot
across that folder with in a bag once we
[SPEAKER_02]: cut them down to branch size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were the size of my little
fingertip buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were kind of tight and nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sold them actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they were just a very mild smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they had resin, but not not like they
would have been super killer weed if
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd gotten a month and a half more or
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the end of December, early January,
like they would in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me let me maybe ask you this,
because I didn't I don't think we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about this last time in the area that you
were in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What month or around what date was it safe
to plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what was kind of like the latter
part of your harvest window where after
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was cold and rainy and you were in
fear of losing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, those giant Hawaiian plants,
they because they were Oaxacan crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were ready in October and like no
later than mid-October, I'd say probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rains and cold didn't really hit
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: October traditionally in Arizona is the
second driest month of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: June is the driest October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has changed since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had a beautiful fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So down in the canyon had cool nights,
but the days would be warm and nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just we harvested everything out of
this camp, out of this garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: except those Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were going back and watering them
and back and watering them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, on Thanksgiving, when it was
snowing up above and we had to go out on
[SPEAKER_02]: the mesas in inches of snow and big clods
of mud on our feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just we decided we have to take
them now because we didn't want to come
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't want to come back any colder and
wetter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it just never reached
maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the earlier ones, all these others,
the Hawaiians, they came out wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to hang them there in the
shade, dry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember, actually,
we didn't have breakdown boxes like we did
[SPEAKER_02]: in following years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just, I think, put them in our in big
bags, you know, garbage bags and carried
[SPEAKER_02]: them up top of the rim with our pack
frames.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had metal pack frames, Kelty's,
and we would just strap everything to
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't get handled as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing that when we had
breakdown boxes after they were after the
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk number one was manicured,
it was put right into these wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: cardboard boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we bought stacks of and brought them
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we assemble them down in the
canyon, taped them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could carry six or seven stacked
on a pack frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more than that, they would be catching
on branches and it wasn't feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that came out very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't get crushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't get smashed, pound at a time,
roughly in each box.
[SPEAKER_05]: That 1979 harvest, was that the one that
ended up in the high times?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what was referred to in that high
times that is up here on the page?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see here it says, Colombian
stock, killer purple, 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny because one guy actually paid
us 2000 a pound for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just seeded and they loved it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had some lightly seeded
Hawaiian, one branch out of all this
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: We came back after, as we traditionally
did every week, we were looking through,
[SPEAKER_02]: inspecting, and then we found one branch
that was seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had, you know, hermit back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took a garbage bag and put it over
quickly, cut that branch off, but it had
[SPEAKER_02]: enough time to lightly seed a few of the
plants neighboring to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people loved finding those few seeds
and they were like, do you have any more
[SPEAKER_02]: of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: They liked the smoke and it was the
Oaxacan Hawaiian kind of rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so how many of these in this list are
from you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: On this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, on this particular list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the one that says magic, Hawaiian
magic, Sensemia, and all these others were
[SPEAKER_02]: current things on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like downtown Maryland.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we didn't actually chat
about last time, but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you guys were doing your guerrilla,
you know, obviously like you can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: wildly divergent amount of males and
females off a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you plant everything in your alluvial
plains and all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just cut males as they appeared?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you plant them in pot you did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you go out there more than once a
week when things were turning from veg to
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers so that you didn't show up and all
of a sudden a stray male had like nuked a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole patch with seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how did you handle the transition when
you were worried about maybe we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: caught all the males yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next garden that was 19,
marked as 1979 as the double E.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we called it the double E is it
was on a topo map right under the word
[SPEAKER_02]: creek where the double E's were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went, oh, that's an easy way to
spot it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we called it the double E.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent three nights, I mean,
three days and two nights every week on
[SPEAKER_02]: the next three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't just go out overnight and water
and then leave the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were there three days out of seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we anything that was even remotely
spooky looking like, wow, this might be a
[SPEAKER_02]: male change in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might have just prematurely cut them
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everything was grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the year we ran two gardens are big,
big here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing I bought three thousand seeds
because the plants were about a foot tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we came back a week, three days later,
four days later, and grasshoppers had
[SPEAKER_02]: eaten them down every single one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to replant on the 1st of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put them in a tiny seed garden area
where we could put a screening over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were super crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just digging them out with wet
inner palm in our hands and plugging them
[SPEAKER_02]: in, plugging them in and replacing
everything that had been eaten by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was weird, there was a few plants
that made it through from the grasshopper
[SPEAKER_02]: plague.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that we planted and they were
like a month, a month earlier than the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones we had to replant in June,
maybe more than a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the June ones caught up with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing because of the 100 degree
weather and the sun and the watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time end of the summer,
like let's say August was around,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were all equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having that little six foot by 10 foot
garden full of seeds, luckily we we were
[SPEAKER_02]: able to replant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it would have been
catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe maybe another angle is where
did you first learn about what an early
[SPEAKER_01]: female or an early male even looked like
back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Rob Clark's book?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it high times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it people telling you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously like now, you know,
like you look at it and like two pistols
[SPEAKER_01]: mean a female and a little claw looking
thing means a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back then, did you have that kind of
knowledge beforehand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they get kind of advanced before you
realized what they were?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know from the first year in 1976 that we
grew I got to see what males looked like
[SPEAKER_02]: and females, but not until they were
probably more advanced and visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Rob Clark, I mean, his early book,
the one that he did in 77 on pod press
[SPEAKER_02]: that was actually his dissertation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that he he hand drew all the
drawings in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cover every single plant he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And drew those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's not only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a he's a good artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus his photography later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, he says when he traveled around and
did that book on hashish, the photos are
[SPEAKER_02]: just excellent, you know, not watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Growers Guide by Mel Frank that I
think showed I don't know if they were
[SPEAKER_02]: photos, but it was a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by this year, I had already grown for
two years before this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not the original garden, but by 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we went for two gardens at once,
we had enough experience to know what to
[SPEAKER_02]: look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we were spending three days a week
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think maybe even at the time when
the males had to be separated,
[SPEAKER_02]: we might have just had one of our we had a
third partner who helped us part time and
[SPEAKER_02]: he was from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw him when I went to spandibus in 2019
and stayed at his house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's he's five years older than I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he still smokes hash mixed with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been doing it for 50 years as the
custom over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's an artist, of course,
Swiss artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he may have just been down there as
because I'm know what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up it was almost 50 50 with the
skunk 50 50 males 50 50 females.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't end up with big, huge empty
sections of the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also transplanted into any open
sections if we had to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would dig up a plant that was four feet
tall with a big group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And slide it over five more feet to get
into a hole that had more sun and was
[SPEAKER_02]: empty because a male had been removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did a lot of transplanting and
movements.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was experimental to see if it would
work in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very hardy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The term weed is is accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, Jackie, we last week,
we talked about the turps and flavors of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you were just talking about
that first year where the Colombians
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't finish, but you got a few purple
ones out of there that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were made good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I wasn't really satisfied
with my answer last week when when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: asked what what did I, you know,
describe those those flavors and smells
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off a Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I realized as I thought
back on it that, you know, that most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and what I know about Colombian
is more about what came imported,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and was bought than what I grew
because it just it was just so difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to pull those things off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, for me, it's it's such a
treat that we have, you know, we have it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the the essence of it captured in the
ohays as Sam shared it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that because otherwise it's so hard
to grow, you know, growers all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: country were like they tried and it didn't
turn out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they found something better in
the stuff just kind of disappeared.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, can you talk about that
that Colombian, the smells?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, did the anthocyanin or whatever
the purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that really take over and dominate the
one that you managed to to harvest and or,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they were they.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it was like, you know,
it was Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, when the light starts
dropping down, the purple tends to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: more and it it didn't really have a
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hawaiians that were will Hawkins
crosses, they had a wonderful scent
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Colombian, because they didn't
even have the tiny buds till like late
[SPEAKER_02]: October, beginning of November,
they they didn't it wasn't warm like the
[SPEAKER_02]: hot summer end of the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have really much sense at all
until they were dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you crushed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you're talking about,
the piney.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you would, you know,
focus on the piney last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, I had a lot of that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I said, all my school,
all my friends at school, everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing these Colombian plants and the
Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody had these little Christmas trees
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people, they got more mature and,
you know, you got you got a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pine was was dominant for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the diversity of what we
got in the imported smoke was just above
[SPEAKER_00]: and beyond, you know, because the golds
and the reds and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some amazing stuff, you know,
and gold and distinctive, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: each one just such a unique, distinctive
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Mexico, all of them,
you know, whether it's Sinaloa or Guerrero
[SPEAKER_02]: or Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Entirely the way they looked, they smelled
and the highs, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Mexico is a long country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombia is pretty big, but there's in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like tropical versus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five thousand foot level versus Santa
Marta way up at eight thousand nine
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it they were land races that didn't
really get mixed up too much back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: old days, at least until the 60s,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the impact of the processing and
transport to, you know, whatever it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia before it went on the boat or in
the in the case of the high grade stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like the golds and the reds, you know,
maybe on an airplane, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that had such an impact on it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot about the commercial
stuff that that, you know, we used to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: on the street or sell even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what what I think is
interesting is that the essence of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that it was a shadow of what it
was when they when they finished it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the essence of it point.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we could throw in there is
that a number of people that have talked
[SPEAKER_01]: to Matt and I about growing in that era,
when they first grew green marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got scared because they didn't think
people would want it because all the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: they got was black, brown or yellow or
gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why that's why I asked last week if
they if they sun dried because that tends
[SPEAKER_05]: to be the way that the Mexicans and stuff
are getting their golds like girdling or
[SPEAKER_05]: sun drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've heard that consistently that a
lot of times the first home grows are the
[SPEAKER_01]: first outdoors that people did in
different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, my God, it's such a
weird color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people going to like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, obviously, like now it's
shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm curious is when you did your when
you did your your shade drying and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, what kind of colors were you
getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it staying green?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it turning golds and yellows and
browns?
[SPEAKER_02]: No gold, yellows or browns, just greens or
dark greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skunk number one was super dark green.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even in 76, when we my dealer friend
and I grew that first year, the the proof
[SPEAKER_02]: was in the pudding, we would give people a
smoke, just one puff or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were overwhelmed if they were
used to commercial stuff and seedless.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had not seen seedless really,
unless they had gotten tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tie sticks were pretty much always
seedless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tie sticks back then were not
green.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were brown or, you know, and darker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always colored olive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the light green.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even give that a thought,
because once our few people that bought
[SPEAKER_02]: from us smoked it, that's all they cared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, they bought everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two people bought everything we grew,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because we heard we heard people
telling us stories about how when they
[SPEAKER_01]: first grew green weed, they tried to brown
it up because they were like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, no one's going to want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the right color.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't look like anything we've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and not only that, but some of the
early years, you know, when people have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad experience with green weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the guy who grows a patch
full of Colombian and it doesn't finish
[SPEAKER_00]: and he harvests this leafy stuff with just
a few white hairs and mostly tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he handles it poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's loaded with chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sells it to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, all of a sudden there's
this bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green weed is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year, people grow
different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit gets mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They handle it better, you know,
and all of a sudden there's high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: green weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people's perception of the color is
that it's a turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to try and overcome that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting them to, you know, try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, this is different or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the thing about renaming or changing
the appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people would,
you know, we knew that the stuff molded,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that the Colombian that turned
it brown it was some sort of mold from
[SPEAKER_00]: being pressed when it was still wet or
carried in the cargo bay of the ship or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since we'd been smoking that stuff
for years and, you know, people thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might try and, you know,
they might try and press some of their wet
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown and get a different appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it never turned out like the
Colombian, you know, and it only wound up
[SPEAKER_00]: making it worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that chlorophyll was pretty horrible
to smoke if you had those unfinished tops
[SPEAKER_00]: that somebody was trying to pass off as
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and plus high times was,
you know, was was becoming really popular
[SPEAKER_00]: and people were hearing about green from
Hawaii and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing for us was, you know,
I mean, I had produced some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking indica buds, but I would say it
was Hawaiian, you know, or from California
[SPEAKER_00]: just because, you know, your homegrown
isn't, you know, because I was charging
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 an ounce for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and people were happy to pay it,
even though, you know, as kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a guy I had a guy trade me a P.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: system with, you know, with a beautiful
mic and a fender backstage 20 for for a
[SPEAKER_00]: half ounce of tie purple tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, I was out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I had was the green Fino,
which didn't finish at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, OK, well, you know,
I knew it wasn't the same stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sold him that second bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and he was so pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wound up giving his money back because
it wasn't even close to the same thing as
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with with the skunk one, did you notice
any like solely broadleaf expressions,
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff that looked just pure Afghani in the
skunk one top?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of the photos that you posted
last week, I think what was interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: about the skunk was it it grew like long
colas and they were almost self pruning in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the sun leaves would all turn yellow
and you could just shake the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: they would fall off and leave these long
green colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have one photo from that I took that
is just slightly blurry, but it's just a
[SPEAKER_02]: series of the four four to six foot tall
colas, you know, like one cola coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the ones that were six point
eight ounces, you know, on average.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dense and nice, very deep,
deep green.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was no Indica fat leaf
expressions solely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was truly true breeding at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What Robert and Sam had accomplished,
I think Robert was more of the geneticist
[SPEAKER_02]: in doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some someplace in the history
where they said they had ten thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: foods going in red cups and they chose
from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's accurate,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it it really when we planted it,
it grew the way it looked each plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a little bit wider leaves,
certainly than like Acapulco gold or Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Marta, your tropical fin leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing like the deep chunk or maple
leaf Indica's that you know, people add on
[SPEAKER_02]: on IC mag that look just like,
you know, umbrellas almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could yeah, your head if it's raining
dinosaur leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it your impression then?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, you said before that
you reached out to you reached out to to
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob through a letter and contacted him and
he brought you the seeds is what you said
[SPEAKER_01]: previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you meet Sam back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he talk about their partnership?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he did they did he tell you any of the
work that he had done to get to skunk one
[SPEAKER_01]: that he shared?
[SPEAKER_02]: All my info came from Robert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never met Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never talked to him personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've I've private message with him on IC
mag in 2012, but nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've I've sent him some labels for his
collection, but I don't I've never met
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all secondhand from Robert when he
described and I I don't know if Rob was
[SPEAKER_01]: when I got on when I got on there,
Sam was very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I saw all of his collection
of of, you know, essentially breeder art
[SPEAKER_01]: and grower art that they would that they
would make and attach to their pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would post a lot and something called I
was was it called the Breeders Lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something along those lines,
but he was pretty active in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just I'm just always curious
about like what, you know, had did Rob
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you how long he'd been working on
skunk one when he gave it to you or any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like any info along those lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that, you know, he worked in Ben
Loman, which is a little town up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Redwoods just above Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You you might go through Ben Loman,
for instance, if you're going to go up
[SPEAKER_02]: further up to like La Handa, where Neil
Young lived still a distance from San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he told me that that's where he they
had their little underground greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but he made it sound like they had
been doing it for a year or two before.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never went into the history of these
other neighbors in Santa Cruz that Sam
[SPEAKER_02]: knew that were the two brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those stories, those I read more about
later in on ICMAG and people disputing it
[SPEAKER_02]: and one person saying, oh, no,
it was this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, he he he mentioned, though,
that he had been working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought his 1977 treatise not from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where I found it,
but somewhere online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he came out with marijuana
botany, you know, everyone bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it wasn't for the growers guide,
Mel Franks, we would have failed because
[SPEAKER_02]: when we had that year, the second year
where we got this twist on the end of all
[SPEAKER_02]: of our plants, and they were already six
foot, seven foot plants, we were like
[SPEAKER_02]: freaking out because they were supposed to
be getting flowers instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the leaves twisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talked about micronutrients and how you
could have a you could be short and a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple micronutrients in your soil,
and that could make the world a different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got some concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seaweed extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have 90 different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minerals from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing even comes close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we bought a big backpack pump sprayer
filled with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it held two gallons and just
walked around and sprayed the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we did it once and waited
three or four days and then we did it
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but by the end of a week or eight or
nine days, they were all untwisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they were missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was because of Mel Franks book
about Mike talking about micronutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of zoned it down to being
molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lack of molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's what's amazing about that
to me is that many years later in 1993,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was planning on growing for the
first time, two of the three books that
[SPEAKER_01]: taught me things was Rob Clark's Marijuana
Botany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mel Frank's Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there were different additions
by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they'd been through some
revisions and things as time had gone on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the same knowledge to a young kid
desperate for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing that even came close
when it first came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there were Bibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really was really was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine got so dog eared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some like rings through it to hold
it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I passed it on to, you know,
another another guy that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wound up growing and breeding and taking
seeds to dead concerts and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was pretty, pretty foreign to me as
a skateboard punk rocker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mel, it was I think I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was three people involved in that
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mel Frank and Ed Rosenvall are the two I
remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a third author that was that
contributed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To some degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have the books at my house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was Ang Lee?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's another photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that book.
[SPEAKER_01]: That book I probably read a hundred times
in six or eight months before I set up my
[SPEAKER_01]: first indoor because I had no idea what I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, when you got it not so it was
probably called the Indoor Outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the original one was just Growers
Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I indexed my books so that I could go in
there and find whatever page I needed to
[SPEAKER_02]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the Marijuana Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More stuff, you know, five hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably hard for young
people today to like conceive of just how
[SPEAKER_01]: sparse and hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of this information was because
they're used to the Internet and typing
[SPEAKER_01]: things in and forums and resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really limited back then in
terms of what you could access and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and how to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those books played, obviously,
even with you guys, they played a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: role in in teaching people exactly how to
pull off a successful crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first year it came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1978 is the first edition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And or press in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mine is kind of falling apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, what's one of my bookmarkers in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have at least two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used to we used to go to the
library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I would search for everything
on hydroponics because I even growing
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, I was doing outdoor hydroponics
in 1981, you know, five gallon buckets
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with peat moss, cow shit,
perlite and vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, fed with eco grow,
you know, granular two part mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so I went to the library and I
started started researching hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, I stole any good book from
the library that hydroponics and kept it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that was very much self study.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the book we are referring to the
the Rob Clark thesis called The Botany and
[SPEAKER_05]: Ecology of Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my copy that I scanned in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it loaded on screen?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're numbered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's actually not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the few that's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clark actually, one of the few times that
he's ever responded about anything was to
[SPEAKER_05]: give me the print run on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently, there were, I think,
fifteen hundred total.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a first print of five hundred and a
second print of a thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't tell the difference between
the two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are numbered, some are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another example, this is he drew this
by hand and all through the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: This book are his drawings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ordinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just imagine him getting wasted and
just sitting and just digging drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not draw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not by hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, they're they're beautiful drawings
in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like and that's one of the things like
I've been sitting on it forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's not really out there
for people to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some of the most beautiful
drawings of cannabis and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: part, the parts of the cannabis plant that
I actually ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did such an amazing job back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it kind of reminds me of early,
early botanists and explorers,
[SPEAKER_00]: geneticists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They travel around, you know, different
islands and stuff and discovering dodo
[SPEAKER_00]: birds and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sitting around drawing in their
sketchbooks, describing the fauna and
[SPEAKER_00]: flora of these these exotic locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got it so accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just they looked exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the indication of plants that he he
drew in marijuana botany were just spot
[SPEAKER_00]: on, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the elegant the elegance of the
branches and the leaves that he drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I always I didn't know if he drew
him or somebody else did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he drew him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought they were gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another book he did called Hemp
that was released in Germany that has some
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful illustrations of his.
[SPEAKER_05]: And but it's not available in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you guys can trace down a copy of
Hempf, which is German for him,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's more beautiful drawings from him
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you zoom over to the Humboldt up here
on your list, the article that I found on
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt growing, I thought not the dog
would find this interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has it has Rob Clark in the corner here
when he's 29 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding a bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in color.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I only scan in black and white because
I might I'm running low on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, I could have scanned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: This works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this article is from about 1982
because he mentioned something,
[SPEAKER_02]: the price of marijuana in 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, right up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in 82, an estimated one point eight
billion dollars a street value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was 29 in 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go backwards and figure that
out how old he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came down to the grill once with his
wife at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was we hung out together for a few
days in the grill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the concept was he was going to look
for some land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see him after those first few
days, but I think he traveled around a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is great because it talks about
the helicopters and in Humboldt and at
[SPEAKER_02]: this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad you saved this second photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figure where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, one of the one of the
interesting things about when helicopters
[SPEAKER_01]: first started flying is that people were
growing all these giant sativas in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hills and Humboldt and Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody as long as you were tucked
away, nobody cared how big they were
[SPEAKER_01]: because no one was looking for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's articles I've read were
like the very first gardens that got
[SPEAKER_01]: busted by helicopters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually chopped down most of the
gardens with chainsaws because the the
[SPEAKER_01]: stocks were like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were so big and thick and the people
weren't worried about about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just had these ginormous you know,
these huge sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gangster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's that's that's pushing a certain
narrative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That old chainsaw thing was that's that
was common down and where I was living,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the National Guard helicopters
were flying looking looking for the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when we would go out,
when I went out to my gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always dressed in camouflage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the whole gorilla mindset,
leaving no trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would create a trail to your spot
where you would go from step to step,
[SPEAKER_00]: always putting your foot in exactly the
same spot that you did the time before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, crawling under bushes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably familiar, Raho.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have we have a bunch of manzanitas in
Mendocino County, which are for people
[SPEAKER_01]: that aren't familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of these like smooth limbed
bushes that get anywhere from six to 12
[SPEAKER_01]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can kind of thin them out
underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people grew in manzanita
patches because you could still get some
[SPEAKER_01]: filtered light, but it wasn't going to be
totally exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crawling around in manzanita patches
and cutting off lower branches to make
[SPEAKER_01]: spots for gardens is is like my first
outdoor experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you holding up there right there,
sir?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you zoom in on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is these are humble photos from that
same article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me try to zoom in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's holding up something on his
thing, Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not easy to get back to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are some guys pruning their father
and son, pruning some big leaf plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both have 38 caliber weapons in
their back pocket that they point out in
[SPEAKER_02]: this article and the guard dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here's an aerial shot of a huge
garden like the chainsaw you're
[SPEAKER_02]: describing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People took that risk, but it didn't
always work once the helicopters came.
[SPEAKER_01]: The helicopters dramatically changed
people's approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to a huge degree, because most of
these things were grown in like like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, that's super easily
visible from the air, but like not not
[SPEAKER_01]: from driving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's him.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the other color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color difference is just so obvious
from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tactics for hiding this stuff became,
you know, pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are your humble sheriffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the garden that they just dismantled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that Newsweek magazine,
Mad Jag, the that came out that at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, there was another article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if it was Time or it was
a national publication where they came out
[SPEAKER_00]: with an article talking about this new
high potency kind of super weed that was
[SPEAKER_00]: that was, you know, flooding the streets
called Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been I've been I've been looking
for this magazine or this article ever
[SPEAKER_00]: since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly I thought the reference was
in that Newsweek that had the guy with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mask and the and the M16.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it wasn't, you know, I've read
that article since and I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a reference to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they describe the effects of Skunk in
that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's classic reefer madness,
you know, writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but they honestly they got it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they describe the appearance of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They describe the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty spot on for what I
thought Skunk was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: A reason for tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from the state of Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a it's an entire reefer madness
basically about, you know, what's really
[SPEAKER_02]: really bizarre is this high school
undercover.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an article about guys who look at
he's got a heavy metal t shirt,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's showing his badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a whole article about going
undercover in the various high schools in
[SPEAKER_02]: Utah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like 21 Jump Street, like the TV show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll tell you, this is obviously
so much later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first time that I ever saw a guy
with waist long dreadlocks tackle someone
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put cuffs on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Dead Tour, I was like, oh,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, are these guys labeled in this
picture?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do look labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't read what they are, but they do
look labeled.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the sharp ones, they're labeled like
Hawaiian Maui stickless tie, orange
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spell Colombian wrong, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always spell it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the Michoacan Maui.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had some really good photos here
of different things that they had
[SPEAKER_02]: confiscated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Hawkin red, Colombian red,
Guerrero gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always love those pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reference pictures from point of
origin and time are so valuable,
[SPEAKER_05]: so, so, so valuable.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's hard when it's cops, you know,
taking the pictures and you got to hope
[SPEAKER_05]: that they got your bag right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And got this kept the strain name with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if it's your bag, you probably got
other things to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freaking provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one thing that one thing that I
think is kind of interesting, too,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's it's it's obviously we don't need
to dwell on it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that like from what I'm
listening to and you guys are talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about all these different highland and
lowland Colombians and all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: regions and stuff like that and all these
different Mexicans and what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of think that like the cocaine
trade and profitability with that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: blocked off the next generation of
Americans from being able to experience
[SPEAKER_01]: that because the groups that were all
bringing in those Colombians and bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: in those Mexicans, they shifted to a more
profitable thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also became unsafe for people
a lot of times that looked like us to go
[SPEAKER_01]: down to those regions and get those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was this era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was two things that were happening at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the cocaine, you know, became much
more profitable for the same people that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, were formerly smuggling
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the American
homegrown market had had happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that product was just such a
higher level of quality than what what the
[SPEAKER_00]: imports had because of the freshness and,
you know, the introduction of hard hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: hard hitting Indica's in their high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what what what year do you think
that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: 80, 82, 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I mean, we don't need to
sidetrack on it, but there's been an
[SPEAKER_01]: interplay between like what Mexico and
down south does versus what's going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: America and like each one responding to
the other in terms of cannabis that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: going on for, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not that's not a sidetrack at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, it's another Madjag
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we dive on into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that the story about, you know,
how, you know, Madjag's contribution to
[SPEAKER_00]: the to the the the Mexican cannabis gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: My people's you represent my people in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how did they how did this start
happening?
[SPEAKER_05]: What era did the the Mexico stuff start
occurring at Jag and how?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the last year I grew in Madjag
Canyon was 81.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by 82, I I knew a guy who was a pilot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not the pilot I wrote about like
that, you know, when we talked about 60
[SPEAKER_02]: tons of Packy Hatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a guy I met him when I was working
a regular job at a truck loading place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked for Georgia Pacific for two years
in Phoenix in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy one day he walked up to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was loading his truck up with empty
plastic bottles, which is what they
[SPEAKER_02]: produce at Georgia Pacific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, hey, if if I found a whole
bunch of weed out in the desert,
[SPEAKER_02]: could you sell it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had short hair, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he just figured he felt that vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, well, I was flying over this area
and I see where someone jettisoned one an
[SPEAKER_02]: empty fuel canister and it stuck in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to go out there and check
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's they were smuggling weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, sure, man, just let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came back a week later and he was
all disappointed because it was just an
[SPEAKER_02]: empty fuel canister.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually Air Force that had
dropped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was stuck in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a bomb, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it didn't explode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then he started talking about other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, like two months
later, he comes back and I'm loading his
[SPEAKER_02]: truck and he says, I met the people in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I said, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's he stole a twin engine Cessna
from Scottsdale Airport, flew to
[SPEAKER_02]: Guadalajara and gave it to the cartel to
prove to them that he was not a narc.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a gangster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know later he stole a helicopter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of Apache Junction and flew it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he only got 20 miles into Mexico
before something went wrong mechanically
[SPEAKER_02]: and he had to crash land and hike his way
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the FBI came to his house because he
found his fingerprints in Mexico on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he denied everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they couldn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scared the shit out of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I bet the.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought several loads of of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found an airstrip in along the Mogollon
Rim in a small town area way out by
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like within five minutes,
they said they would be there at one o
[SPEAKER_02]: 'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like they were at one oh five
kicking out bales onto the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would they would bring five
hundred kilos each flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where one of two of the flights
had labels already in them from someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who was supposed to get them in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something went wrong and we got them
instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still hunting for those labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got them somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a connection with those guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was 82 and 83.
[SPEAKER_02]: El Bufalo that Rafael Carro Quintero.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see it from space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a square couple of miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they show it in that TV show
Narco Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's the name of the garden or
the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: El Bufalo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rancho Bufalo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And was this at the beginning of the the
Gallardo era of the development?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is when they were just doing
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened was they they grew
thousands and thousands of hectares of of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, but they didn't have anyone growing
seeds, seed crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they they were desperate for seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my father, my pilot friend,
along with my other friend, who was the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed dealer in Tempe, we filled two quart
sized bags half full, and he stuck one in
[SPEAKER_02]: each of his cowboy boots and gave it to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were so grateful because it they
they had no seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, I was part of this
because seeds from five different zones in
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico ended up in their hands and became
the new hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, well, it's like, why would you
say, unfortunately, in 1980s, Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics were already in the grill of
Jamaica and the people go wild over them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were growing them up in Orange Hill
and all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So land races were getting squeezed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to find true Jamaican, I don't think
it's there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's probably land races still in
stash spots and certainly in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But boy, Jamaica being a little island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you could clarify for a second,
then those seeds that you brought down or
[SPEAKER_01]: he brought down smuggled in his boots.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were they a mix of?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a mix of Guerrero, Sinaloa,
Michoacan, Oaxacan that my dealer friend
[SPEAKER_02]: in Tempe had hydrated over the course of
like two or three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best of the loads that had passed
through the loads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why you were like,
oh, you were a little bummed about it
[SPEAKER_01]: because you kind of mixed the strange
grains and then they started growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then instead of it being like a
regional thing where these specific kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: were coming from, it was sort of a blend
coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: El Buffalo got discovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote down this November 14th of 84 is
when they found it and burned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually the smoke affected people
within a hundred mile radius.
[SPEAKER_02]: They burned 500 hectares and they
estimated that it was worth two point five
[SPEAKER_02]: billion dollars at that time in 84.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a famous scene in Narcos where
he I think it was it was Guyarra's
[SPEAKER_05]: brother, Raf.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that his brother?
[SPEAKER_05]: It produces in the in the in the series
like this is the super the super strain
[SPEAKER_05]: that the scene Samia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this before or after you met him that
or is this the the hybrid that you're
talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we gave them seeds in 82 and 83 and
El Buffalo was captured and burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it ran for years before
that, but just in general, they King
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrell was growing weed in other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Buffalo was like their huge place.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had their own wells drilled there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in Sinaloa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've I've read about it in a book
called The Underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 900.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 pages long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's written by a DEA agent who is in
charge of all the stuff going on then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has three chapters, one on heroin,
one on cocaine and one on weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one on needs about El Buffalo
being spotted by a TWA pilot or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're flying over and they went,
what in the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just mentioned it casually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where Kiki Camarena got a job and
went and actually penetrated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the second movie of Sicario,
so popular, it's kind of similar because
[SPEAKER_02]: he's dressed up as a compass, you know,
and he gets a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiki is the is that the that's the name of
the DEA agent that got killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Camarena.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that caused a huge amount of problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Left it alone, you know, but they didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when they were switching over
to cocaine, just about 84, 85.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that being burned, Kintero,
from what I read, just became an addict
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, drug addict of whatever he
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want to see them go into
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rafael Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo,
he went ahead and went, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he became he formed the first cartel with
all these loose plazas that were existing
[SPEAKER_02]: guys over here and guys over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stayed at his hotel in 84,
one of his many.
[SPEAKER_02]: He owned apparently a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend who is the pilot,
we went down there and my friend from
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombia found his way there from
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all had a big party.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were hoping that my friend from
Colombia would be able to turn them on to
[SPEAKER_02]: newer connections and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know really what happened because
he loved to do coke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he and I both decided we didn't want
to be in that business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pilot, this guy, he he kept going.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were using our airstrip, the one that
we had found for weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sixteen hundred to two thousand pounds of
coke at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did nine loads and then they an off
duty sheriff who was cutting wood saw them
[SPEAKER_02]: landing and unloading and they got busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a clip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've I've posted before, I think,
an IC mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I never met I never met Miguel Felix,
but my partners did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did enjoy his hospitality because we
went into this hotel room and there was
[SPEAKER_02]: just like in the movies, a plate with a
four ounce pile of cocaine and two other
[SPEAKER_02]: guys who did nothing but just bring cases
of beer all through the.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a weekend at Natsos place,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Except except there's a lot more men,
a lot crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt loves that if he doesn't at least
once a show, throw me off my game with
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, he's upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, he found his opening and he
took it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, just just, you know,
I'm proud that that that whole thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I when I was when I was starting
to do guerrilla in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things that the Mexicans did
was that even with the cocaine,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was told that like still 70 percent of
their profits was marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they really didn't like all this
homegrown in the West Coast sort of taking
[SPEAKER_01]: their taking their, you know, their their
sales really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started sending these teams
all from down by where Matt is all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the Oregon border and going in the
national forests and just growing a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: amount as much as they could get away with
in all the national forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, they didn't have to smuggle
it over the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's that was kind of so
there's been this obviously this like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I was saying before about like
how one one country influences the other
[SPEAKER_01]: is the homegrown movement has dramatically
changed how the how the Mexicans approach
[SPEAKER_01]: growing weed because, you know,
for a long time, they were sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: primary weed people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in Arizona with the border
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tucson was like the capital of smugglers
and and dealers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it moved up to Phoenix and Tempe
and Scottsdale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they they busted a big grow in the
canyon next to us just 10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a gang from from Mexico
operating out of Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a spring that they had found
up on the side of this mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a system of drip irrigation
that ran a mile down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just went too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys, they just didn't even think
about hunters and ranchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just threw a team at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Group all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they all got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring on a spring on a hillside model.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the way it was done in
NorCal when I was out there that summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've seen lots of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the I think the cartels kind of
had a they viewed a lot of their workers
[SPEAKER_01]: as semi disposable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they sort of expected a certain
amount to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just threw a lot of people out
there in a lot of different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they figured most of them will be
successful and some of them won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how they went about it,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when the when the powder
came in, you know, I think a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian import just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stopped entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Mexican commercial became they
probably filled the gap for that for that
[SPEAKER_00]: tier of product quality around the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that, you know,
I mean, I started smoking in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was brown Mexican and green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see Panama.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see any of those of those famous
things that people wax poetic about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a decade later and all I saw
was Mexican, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just I never saw Thai.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never saw anything other than just
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so we got a little bit into Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just just a hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to go more into that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there some more details you want to add
in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just rubbing shoulders with these
famous people is kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know who they were at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just guys exporting weed from
Walahara area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when we found out it was Miguel
Angel and we were like, Whoa, shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We I'm so glad we didn't get sucked into
the cocaine deal because the this guy who
[SPEAKER_02]: who was a truck driver, he could fly
helicopters, he could fly planes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went that direction and sold 10 kilos
to an undercover agent north of Phoenix in
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest hand to hand sale by in
Arizona history at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got I think it was seven kilos and
he got 10 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: His brother kept going and did those loads
on our our the airstrip that we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got nine of them before they got
busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we calculated at the price of coke at
the time that it was it came to around a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Million dollars of coke that they
successfully brought in before they got
[SPEAKER_02]: busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no idea what happened to those
boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reselda Blanco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never heard her name until I read
about it in Newsweek or Time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's who my Colombian friend was
actually working for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his job was to count money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would go to Aspen where they bring
in D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: nines or something like six tons at the
time of Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would just his fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could barely move them after a week
because they didn't have machines yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then she's I can imagine hand counting
five million dollars, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and tens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the stories started
happening about how they weighed their
[SPEAKER_02]: their money, because in Florida,
he went to an apartment building once and
[SPEAKER_02]: he said there'd be like five apartments
and they'd have a secret door in a closet
[SPEAKER_02]: that would link it to the next apartment
and to the next apartment so that if they
[SPEAKER_02]: had to bail, they could just disappear.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went into one apartment and he said
it was Florida ceiling with tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: passageways in the hallways of just money
piled Florida ceiling, every single room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said there was millions of millions
of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the kind of places
where they would just weigh money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then send it back to
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the responsibility of being the dude
who has to count it, because like you get
[SPEAKER_05]: that shit wrong, you're going to be the
first person they look at.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Jamaican friends in Brooklyn,
the guy who was in charge, he goes by the
[SPEAKER_02]: nickname Sata.
[SPEAKER_02]: He overpaid us once two thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know him and he did it as a trick to
see if we were going to tell him and be
[SPEAKER_02]: honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We counted the money a second time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said in his house in Brownsville.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you know, Sata, you're over by
two thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not even possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was just messing with us because he
wanted this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were it was early in our relationship
and he wanted to see if we were honest
[SPEAKER_02]: enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We passed the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to do that with my spray,
like my reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd give it to different people and,
you know, give them different like,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, you know, for this exchange or this
exchange.
[SPEAKER_05]: And knowing mostly that I was never going
to get anything, but just kind of get a
[SPEAKER_05]: good gauge of who is going to just take
it, run with it, use it to make themselves
[SPEAKER_05]: a bunch of money or who would do,
you know, what they said.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's it's a small loss,
but it's a good way to judge a potential
[SPEAKER_05]: future lifelong friend, too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheap way to to figure out who you can
trust.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to them and to the other person,
it's almost like from a greedy person's
[SPEAKER_05]: angle, it's like, well, this one bottle
could potentially make me, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: several thousand dollars worth of feminine
seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it worth the burn?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and a lot of times it is worth
the burn to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magic Magic always says, if there is a
doubt about a person, then there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a line from the movie Ronin and
Ronin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, if there's a doubt,
there is no doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's near the end of the movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you find out that he never
quit and he was still working for the CIA
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert De Niro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The classical movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you I treat my life that way,
if I have a doubt about something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just go, I'll wait and see what the
universe does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I didn't do that when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, I would jump in with both feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you seem to have a very magical
touched life, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of people, you know,
only live a fraction or see a fraction of
[SPEAKER_05]: what what you managed to get yourself
wound up in time and time again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact is, you guys weren't outlaws
as far as carrying guns and being cowboys
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You carried this very humble.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a nice dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great big throwing knife on my hip
when I'm going to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't know what good that
would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we we specifically didn't we knew
other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the guys from Jerome, they are all
all heavily armed and they would have
[SPEAKER_02]: barbed wire in the bushes and weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You read about this in magazines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just going, that's that makes
them instantly dangerous criminals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just hippies, dangerous criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important distinction to make,
because I think we've chatted for long
[SPEAKER_01]: enough now that I can safely say that
everybody on on this this little this
[SPEAKER_01]: little call that we're doing is is a weed
nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, having been in a bunch of
counterculture kind of my whole life,
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally differentiate between like
people who do certain substances,
[SPEAKER_01]: but are otherwise like honorable and very
good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some of the things they decided
to get into happened to not be societally
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then people that are like actual
criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know where it's and there's a big
difference there because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that they do wrong,
really, they could get them into
[SPEAKER_01]: significant trouble is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I and I was when I was
listening to you guys talk about some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the the transition into powders and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I've always thought
about is that like the weed game or the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed scene is inherently just like less
dangerous than that other world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when that other world started
happening, maybe it's because of the way
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes people think or the way people
act or the money was so much bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seemed to bring out a lot of like
negative qualities in people that when you
[SPEAKER_01]: were in the weed game existed,
but maybe weren't like maybe weren't like
[SPEAKER_01]: accented quite so much.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my friends in Brooklyn, they would
open the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd have a Mach 9 in his hand,
you know, and he'd look around and make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure it was cool to let us in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had they had plenty of weapons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my friend Ricky, who he's still my
friend, I see him when I go to New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives in Brooklyn in the same apartment
since 74.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never, ever had a gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other Rastas did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but he was he's a philosopher.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a real gentle guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good brother of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known him 40 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he he's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go have curry goat with him whenever
we're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes me to a different restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love curry goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And aki and salt fish they have in these
those Caribbean neighborhoods,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you can still get all that the
restaurants they cater to the people who
[SPEAKER_02]: live there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say too, like for Mendocino
County, there's definitely people that
[SPEAKER_01]: have guns that had the intention on using
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they were accosted by other
humans, but there was a lot of growers
[SPEAKER_01]: that had guns on them simply because they
were in some remote spot on the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they came across a bear with cubs
or a mountain lion, they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: just die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to have a fighting chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was there was this idea of I'm
alone in the deep woods by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not my territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's bear and mountain lion and
other things that that I'm a lot weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even jaguars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, jaguars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, mountain lions, you know,
bears usually here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain lions, they've been watching you
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever even know that they're there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would encounter all that that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of times all of a sudden
something would go wrong with our water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd have to walk the water line back
to like the the cat, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the the spring box that we had made or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're walking through deep woods,
totally alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you're in the deep woods
and, you know, you don't have teeth or
[SPEAKER_01]: claws and you're not super strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people would have pistols or
shotguns or something just to make
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves feel OK when they're out there
and sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dual dual Dobermans is is popular with
some people I knew.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two Dobermans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were, you know, they went
wherever they went.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had their Dobermans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one's name was Tor and the other one
was Tia, Tortilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this one guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they they were not quite
command dogs, but they were close.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would tell them to do something and
they would just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and they'd sniff out a bear or a bear
would, you know, better let your dogs
[SPEAKER_02]: fight the bear than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in my era, too, it became
uncomfortable because the penalty for
[SPEAKER_01]: getting caught with a gun at a row was
actually like quite a bit worse than the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was kind of like a do you risk it
even because even if even if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to beat the case on a medical thing
or something like that later on with the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, they'd be like, oh, no, he's a
hardened criminal armed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was ready to hurt people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we caught him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, that's what this is from
that humble article.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're pointing out this machine gun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says Humboldt deputies sees this
menacing array of weaponry, including an
[SPEAKER_02]: Uzi and an AK-47 along with marijuana in
raids on growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they love to point those out and
make everybody think that that's what most
[SPEAKER_02]: growers are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people, sadly, I mean,
wherever there's profit involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: people get into it for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and and some of the people
involved certainly were that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't classify it as the majority,
but certainly a percentage, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, they're humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't feel real comfortable in
Wallachara, to tell you the truth,
[SPEAKER_02]: because everyone was packing in those the
guys carrying the beer were packing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just they that's their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took us out to sushi in Wallachara.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was some of the best sushi I've
ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they they were it was a lieutenant of
Miguel's.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went by the name of Wapo, which means
handsome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they took us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was amazing because the guy who ran
it, he'd speak in Japanese to his crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he turned to us and speak in English
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he turned and talked to these
guys in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite, quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't doesn't fit in with the stereotype
of the dumb of the dumb stoner,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, I think Americans are we're
very we're very isolated because we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadians who also speak English for the
most part, besides the people in Quebec
[SPEAKER_01]: above us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got two oceans next to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of parts of the world
are multilingual just because they
[SPEAKER_01]: encounter so many different languages as
part of their daily life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in America, we are we're kind of
broken from that in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my Swiss makes five languages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an aunt who's Swiss and she speaks
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I I actually kind of regret that
because I think the younger you learn
[SPEAKER_01]: language, the more fluent and fluid you
are in speaking and reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Americans a lot of times like
it does something to your brain to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to speak multiple languages and
communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the the story of the peyote
prince.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you briefly or maybe not even briefly,
can you tell us what a peyote prince is?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of their they're both I don't know how
they came into this, but they both knew
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam and Sam was a road chief in the Native
American church in the Navajo reservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a license that allowed him to
go to northern Mexico across the border
[SPEAKER_02]: from Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd come back with a quarter million
or a half a million of peyote buttons for
[SPEAKER_02]: the church, where actually 90 percent of
it wasn't going to the church.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to these two guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would one lived in Tempe two
blocks from the police station.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one in cottonwood,
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I lived at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these were fresh buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to dry them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guy in Tempe had date date racks
that they dry dates in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was perfect for peyote.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you went into his little old house in
Tempe, you had to turn sideways to go down
[SPEAKER_02]: the hallways or go into any room.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, that wasn't the stacks of
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just stacks of date trays drying
two hundred thousand buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once they dried, as you've if you've
seen them, they look like little flat
[SPEAKER_02]: disks and almost like jerky, you know,
like a little piece of jerky.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't be fooled by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would just sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was nineteen seventy three when I was
first in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could get them as low as a nickel
a button if you bought a certain amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could sell them for a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Illinois, in cargo all over the
United States, these two guys had friends
[SPEAKER_02]: who who would come to Arizona and get
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they shipped in UPS or in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: People always took them.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends gave a guy two hundred
and he was going through custom or through
[SPEAKER_02]: the gate to go to his air his flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was about nineteen.
[SPEAKER_02]: 80, I'm thinking, in Phoenix, or maybe it
was 78, somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked back to see his friend
leaving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the security guys was holding
the bag of peyote up in the air and
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and he asked him, what are these?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, they're peyote, they're
cactus seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy went, oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they didn't even have it wasn't even
in the radar and their training yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The princes were amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know both of them still.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still both alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them isn't as healthy as the
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were, you know, it was just an
amazing thing that millions and millions
[SPEAKER_02]: of buttons they sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them were diverted to Redway
to the guy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of my friends would drive 50 to 70
thousand buttons to up to Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would get turned into mescaline
sulfate pure.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mescaline is only like 40 percent,
I think, is some number like that of the
[SPEAKER_02]: alkaloids in peyote.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that everyone knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they even call it mescaline,
you know, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's many other alkaloids that are
significant in a peyote journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you extract just the mescaline
sulfate, then it's a different journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did them both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I compared it to the mescaline
sulfate was like peyote without the
[SPEAKER_02]: teacher, because you take peyote or
experience it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this inner voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's hard to describe, but it seems
like it's someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's you actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your inner consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hearing your thoughts in a way that
it sounds like it's an external voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've never done peyote.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm terrified of throwing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me let me let me interject
something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My my experience with peyote is probably a
lot less than yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say that the buttons were some
of the more bitter things that I ever
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally swallowed in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can see how the mescaline pills might
might go down a little smoother for some
[SPEAKER_01]: people, because you really have to be
like, OK, this is going to be good for me
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as bitter as wormwood,
but it's right up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty intense, bitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember that was that's my
strongest memory of trying to consume them
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was people doing peyote elements to
avoid it going into their gut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was big in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly a couple of ladies trying to get me
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they would make tea and then just do
an animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would have this wonderful
trip and never throw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get any discomfort because you
get your gut, your stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I've I've done ayahuasca in
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: He poofs all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good Lord, I do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say that when you when you are
like, you know, meeting your creator or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever and you're and you're super fired
up, having your stomach hurt and having to
[SPEAKER_01]: purge any which way you have to purge is
pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember when I did it in Brazil,
I had to run out and I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get rid of some things outside of
myself in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really wanted a bright American
clean bathroom because I felt so exposed,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like running in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that experience of other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, peyote, it doesn't it
doesn't feel good digesting some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaloids you were discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body is not ready to digest them
comfortably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes chocolate mescaline and the
stuff that was being sold on the hill in
[SPEAKER_02]: Boulder was not mescaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even at the low price of five or six or
eight cents a button, when this was being
[SPEAKER_02]: made by that that wizard chemist,
in northern California, it it enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: get you high would cost you ten dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these one and two dollar hits of
chocolate mescaline were just LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mixed in unless you paid her ten,
fifteen dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's photos on my one of my
chronicles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like pick up sticks about an
inch long, sharp needles.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you poured them out of a bottle,
they would just pile up in these sharp
[SPEAKER_02]: needle looks and they'd have to be crushed
into a powder to put them in a cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just ate some of the crystals once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but the guy who said, you know,
if you're measuring this out, a good trip
[SPEAKER_02]: would be ten to fifteen dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very few people have actually even seen
or done mescaline sulfate is the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would even say in my era when I was
experimenting with that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's almost all relabeled LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people haven't experienced it because
the buttons are hard to come by and they
[SPEAKER_01]: taste gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and people are just marketing to a
different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, oh, yeah, here's some
mescaline.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was some really good advice you
gave in one of your stories, Jack,
[SPEAKER_05]: about juicing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But can you talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the last time I did peyote,
I juiced 50 buttons, fresh buttons and a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot.
Yeah.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten is you eat 10 fresh buttons.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could get those down, you will have
a really strong journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took 50 and juice them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a quart bottle of beautiful
emerald green liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend who was the tall fellow,
my first grow partner, he drank a third of
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottle and I drank two thirds of the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he spent the whole night face down on
his sleeping bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never moved for like 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask him a question and he
wouldn't answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about three or four minutes
later, he go, no, it was a time lag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a fire going and I was saying,
let's go for a hike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just he was immobilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he had a good when he woke up in the
morning, he said, I had the strangest
[SPEAKER_02]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did enjoy it, though, like the movie
Young Guns with Emilio Estevez and all
[SPEAKER_02]: those young kids stars that were there's a
scene in there where they eat peyote.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're the one guy shooting his gun
wildly out at this mining claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and the other guy is talking and you
hear his voice, but he's not talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whoever produced that movie has done
peyote because they knew about the voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so clear in that scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just amazed that someone had or they
had a technical advisor that knew that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how they would do it, because he
was stumbling around and you could hear
[SPEAKER_02]: this voice talking to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed tried to get me to talk about
psychedelics on the show, and I've kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: kept it weed focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say that sometimes when when
things get very intense, you're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: locked in your own mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if your friend was laying down what
they're experiencing and feeling and
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking and is so intense, you just lose
track of the fact that you have legs and
[SPEAKER_01]: arms and you can't really interact with
the world because you have so much sensory
[SPEAKER_01]: data that's coming into your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're thinking about so many things
that like all that other stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: extraneous to some degree, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that's common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that on mushrooms, on LSD,
on high doses of different things where
[SPEAKER_01]: you just end up kind of in your own head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not a very physical thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very inward thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes that's good and sometimes
that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it usually is is is positive long
term.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as long as you got a safe space
and you're with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set and setting is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I think for episode three,
we might adventure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if you're open to it, maybe make
that more of the full expanse of
[SPEAKER_05]: psychological, psychedelic aspect of your
life, the spiritual journey that brought
[SPEAKER_05]: Madjag to this point, because we're
buttoned up against the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know, like for those who are
watching this, we recorded this around
[SPEAKER_05]: right around Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's kind of squeezing in hours to
get them in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I also wanted to really thank you guys
for spending your time with us and every
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone in the audience on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's an honor, man, and a
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so glad that we I was able to
convince Raho to join in the way he has
[SPEAKER_02]: because I met him for the first time last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been we've been faced to face to
face, but we've been friends for since
[SPEAKER_02]: around 2012 on the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a gas to meet him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to see him sit with people talking
about strains and varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is only one other person,
a guy who goes by the name Satva,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's in Boulder, who can tell you about
30 different types of Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been growing Colombian in Boulder
for like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 10 different Punta Roja strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he and he goes to these places.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he his wife speaks fluent Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: He speaks some and they go down to
Guerrero a lot along the coast in little
[SPEAKER_02]: towns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only get to by boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's posted some photos and yeah,
he's he was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did join us, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say from my perspective that first,
Matt will tell you it takes a lot to shut
[SPEAKER_01]: me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to talk as little as possible,
but I burn with questions almost every
[SPEAKER_01]: third sentence that you or Raho talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to afterwards write down various
questions and ideas that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really cool that we're having
like this multi-stage thing, because an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour or two after we do these things,
I get I'm like, oh, my God, why didn't I
[SPEAKER_01]: follow up on that so bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to remember, you know, because
there's this offhanded comment and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, conversations go in different
directions and you don't always get to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow up on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we like free flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a wealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a wealth of of of information and
just enjoyable convo here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, remember this for next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay phones and quarters, pay phones and
quarters and quarters, because that's how
[SPEAKER_02]: we had to communicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my that was my we ever talk about
the psychedelic aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my era of pay phones and
quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what a chinger is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a black box.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's to make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did when we were on dead tour
is we someone discovered that when you put
[SPEAKER_01]: quarters into a pay phone, the pay the pay
the company actually knows what coin
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting in by the tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a dime is one tone and nickel is one
tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: A quarter is one tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody got the clever idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you could get these little recorders
from Radio Shack that recorded about 30
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds and you could record them and you
could just push in quarters into the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go to make a long distance
call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you we would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would use pay phones and all these
different things and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: tell each other where we're going to be at
what time of day and what hour and call
[SPEAKER_05]: us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not as a boomer.
[SPEAKER_05]: He calls them chingers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't call them black box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hold it up to the mouthpiece of the
phone and hit play and it would make the
[SPEAKER_00]: sound of the coins falling into the
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, eventually the phone
company caught onto it and you would get
[SPEAKER_01]: an operator going, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would have to bail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, yeah, it that was that was
before cell phones when pay phones were
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine dollars and 90 cents for three
minutes to Cali, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the operators were going, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I yeah, it was I used a lot
of quarters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my friend in Manhattan, one of the
three brothers of the weed people,
[SPEAKER_02]: he would buy a thousand dollars worth at a
time at a bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a cart and he'd bring them out
and load up his car.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever he go out, he just put like
10 rolls in his pockets because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, never know how many phone calls
you're going to have to make and how long
[SPEAKER_02]: because he was always calling to different
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay phones.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little spy versus spy on that
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they were safer, especially if
you rotated and didn't use the same ones
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always sucked following not to go after
a pay phone because they're just so
[SPEAKER_05]: sticky.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just cannot deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, he's got two in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's bombed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really practically three with the
whole boofing thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad someone remembered that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially all the messages at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at almost two hours here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Matt, if you want to plug anything and
and we'll keep we'll keep this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of paths we can go
down and we still only scratch the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: on some of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we made it to map one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nineteen seventy nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think yeah, next round, we're going
to go to 1980 map and then continue on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our merch up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check out syndicate gear dot com.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, Raho, anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like we kind of focused on the Madjag
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if we maybe we can organize
or, you know, get a little bit of a game
[SPEAKER_00]: plan to limit or focus discussions that
way, we won't spin off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much we'll be able to drill down on the
upcoming ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, you know, maybe with all this
discussion about old Mexicans,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd maybe give a shout out to one of my
boys, Cryptic Labs, who has a great
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation for his walk in lines that
these are stuff that he's collected back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 80s and has preserved and shared
and is turning out great lines today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just done a kind of a dug out a fresh
batch of old seeds and has done a
[SPEAKER_00]: selection on him and has found a couple of
amazing phenos that I think he'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out with soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cryptic Labs for the old Mex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, just looking forward to
more and some of my own stuff to throw in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your link to the clothing and
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: We said syndicate is syndicate gear dot
com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was going to toss in a quick thing
to Zoe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm not going to be saying
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that the Cromia Collective
out of Thailand, they have some amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: old Land Race ties.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Squirrel Tale, the the Red String tie,
the Dai Deng or I don't want to
[SPEAKER_05]: mispronounce it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they ship very fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got myself it, which is not always
easy when you know, sending money out of
[SPEAKER_05]: the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: So props to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: People looking for land race stuff,
it's a legit place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natto?
[SPEAKER_01]: All I have to say is that I'm excited on
these conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as always, I'm very happy for anyone
that takes the time to listen to us ramble
[SPEAKER_01]: on about a weed and history and culture
and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you all very much.
