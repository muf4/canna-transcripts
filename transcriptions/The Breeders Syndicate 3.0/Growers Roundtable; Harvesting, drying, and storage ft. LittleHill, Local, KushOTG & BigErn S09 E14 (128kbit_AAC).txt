[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_06]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_06]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_06]: seat.
[SPEAKER_06]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_06]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_06]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_06]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_06]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_06]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_06]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Matthew with my cohost, Thousandfold,
and today we're going to be talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: what are we going to be talking about,
Thousand?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about harvest and
post-harvest, and we have the combined
[SPEAKER_08]: indoor and outdoor crews, or at least some
of them from both crews.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to get us started, we wanted to
talk about when do you harvest and maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: we can start with Little Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do I harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a little bigger scale at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvest really needs to be coordinated
with a crew to help harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also sometimes dry space comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like on a light depth, if it strains,
I know, and everything's kind of normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really look at tri-keds too much
anymore with the strains that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of know when they look
finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, I really like to let things
finish fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't want to take sour diesel
before day 70, and if I can let it ride to
[SPEAKER_02]: 70, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's other things to take into
account sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you got your harvest crew together
and it's day 74, fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with shorter flowering stuff,
like 60 days, nine weeks, I got to know
[SPEAKER_02]: the strain, and I want to make sure that
that bud is fully swollen at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will look at tri-keds if I don't know
the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as I see them turning cloudy,
and I'm looking for mold, if I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing mold, I'll let it ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I start seeing mold start to come in,
then it's like, OK, there's a point of
[SPEAKER_02]: diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who cares if you're harvesting right
moldy buds?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those things I take into account.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the full term stuff,
kind of same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's beginning of October.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to start checking for mold,
depending on weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're taking in large harvests,
I'll take the colas first, because those
[SPEAKER_02]: are the first things that are about to
mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get those hanging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the rest of the plant continue to
develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can kind of just start mowing
through the garden like that by taking
[SPEAKER_02]: tops the first thing and then giving the
rest of the plant another week or 10 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on dry space.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year was a bit more hectic than usual
with all the rain we got in October.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mold really started to set in at some
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was kind of like, it's molding,
it's ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to get any more ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just filling up the dry room,
getting it all down, filling it up again,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting it all down, filling it up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't quite get to pick and choose
your day based on whether you want cloudy
[SPEAKER_02]: heads or amber or what.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of got to go in space and labor
is available within range.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cut early, you're just shooting
yourself in the foot with quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're shooting yourself in the foot for
weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to wait for weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's always important not to get
trigger happy with taking it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, sometimes you can't
wait as long as you wanted to,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're not going to have space or
there's rain coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you're not going to have a
harvest crew on certain days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, man, that's probably not
the answer that most of you wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the reality of it is at a
certain scale, you don't get to pick and
[SPEAKER_02]: choose down to the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I had a perfect world,
I would have unlimited dry space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all my harvesting would be done at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is really important to point
out that beyond the kind of ideal
[SPEAKER_08]: finishing time for plants, there are all
these other competing pressures that are
[SPEAKER_08]: possible as well, whether your dry space
is ready.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious to hear about other people's
logistical or administrative pressures
[SPEAKER_08]: outside of ideal finishing time as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think like on the completely
opposite end of that, I like with the
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor stuff, I do more of like,
you know, small perpetual hobby kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I have just like a two by four tent
that I dry in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just kind of, you know, I don't
know, I look at other things like I look
[SPEAKER_03]: at the trichomes sometimes, but more so
now I kind of look at just like if the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant looks like it's done, like,
and I just mean kind of like, is it
[SPEAKER_03]: drinking slower?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, does it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, there's there just comes
a point, like, I think, like, when you run
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're running, if you're running the
plants enough, you get to a point where
[SPEAKER_03]: you just kind of see that, like,
they're not getting better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's like a point where if you
just run them longer, like they can go
[SPEAKER_03]: longer, and they might get more color or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, for me, personally, like,
I just kind of look to when the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like it's kind of drinking slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I don't know, I just think you
just kind of get like a vibe for when the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant feels done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's like kind of a vague answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, there's a point to it where it's
like, you do need to just run the plants a
[SPEAKER_03]: few times and just get an idea of like
what when it's in a good range.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm kind of in a similar position.
[SPEAKER_07]: I usually tend to take most things nine to
10 weeks on average, and then other things
[SPEAKER_07]: like they'll get bumped to like 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll obviously like look at the flower
trichomes, I have like a little jeweler's
[SPEAKER_07]: loop, nothing too fancy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I try to go for majority milky with
like, I don't know, 25% amber.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or sometimes I'm just like lazy and let
things go.
[SPEAKER_07]: An extra week longer or kind of just want
to see where things go.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there, I guess I kind of just
look for senescence.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as Ern mentioned, kind of when
like the plant stops drinking or stops
[SPEAKER_07]: benefiting from any additional feed and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's kind of some of some of
the general cues that I look at for
[SPEAKER_07]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, I wanted to ask you real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the, just generally speaking,
the recognized like signs of senescence?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of like a lot of it kind of
starts with like general like fading and
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like some of the lowers will begin to
fade yellow, but like the remainder of the
[SPEAKER_07]: leaves will sometimes, depending on the
genetics, shift colors and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your plants will stop drinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and my experience, I haven't
particularly seen it in like the case of
[SPEAKER_07]: like either outdoor growing or seed
making, but like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant just doesn't like really want
much more.
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of seems.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no additional bulking either from
my experience after a certain point.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess very generally speaking,
the principle is that it's like
[SPEAKER_08]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_08]: The metabolism is slowing right overall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually, you can definitely see
it in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like an open dialogue with your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been talking with it and
communicating with it all year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it starts slowing down,
you can definitely, you can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: catch onto it.
[SPEAKER_06]: To Ern's point, like if you have that,
and to your point too, Kush, like if you
[SPEAKER_06]: have that relationship with it,
like the only thing that really matters
[SPEAKER_06]: when it comes to harvest is the end user
and what high they're trying to get from
[SPEAKER_06]: it and what the brain chemistry is and
where they like it at the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I mean, like there used to be the
old tale of like, Oh, it better be like
[SPEAKER_06]: 50% amber, 50% milky, you know,
and then you learn amber means some
[SPEAKER_06]: degradation with CBN or whatever else
comes along with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, maybe people prefer like all
amber, you know, maybe like that side of
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe their brain chemistry, maybe that
makes them happy and less anxiety.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I don't, as I've gotten older
and further into this, I kind of realized
[SPEAKER_06]: that like the whole idea of an exact
flower time on anything is kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no right, perfectly right or
perfectly wrong answer for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, my, like back, back when I was
growing 12 or 14 clones of the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: growing that, like my, my Harvey Davis
used to be dictated on what the weather
[SPEAKER_01]: was going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I, if I looked at the weather and
I saw six days of an inch of rain coming
[SPEAKER_01]: for each day and specifically with the
cream, the cream could be cut at 55 at 57
[SPEAKER_01]: days and people would still love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, everybody loved that stuff,
but I really liked pushing it to 65 to 66
[SPEAKER_01]: days where it really shined and put on a
little bit of purple and got its
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, and then as the market changed and
I'm not growing one clone outdoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: going for maximum weight, I started
growing varieties and just letting them
[SPEAKER_01]: run to their full extent, not,
not worrying about the weather and my
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I picked up a tool that I really enjoy
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people have it in their budget,
it's just a live view microscope battery
[SPEAKER_01]: operated, or you can charge it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a nine inch monitor,
a little nine inch screen monitor that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can tow it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take it down to the garden and
live view microscope your, your resin in
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger profiles, not just a, you know,
you can, you can zoom in really far.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could look at it from a pullback
perspective, but that, that tool to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking, looking at the plant's maturity
has always, always been something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: use for my harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lately, like from, from my perspective
and what I've looked at and seen in my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden is I noticed the onset of of amber
trichomes usually start on the sugar leafs
[SPEAKER_01]: on the outside and work their way in
towards the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, some years workload gets
heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to microscope every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to inspect every single bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the times I'll wait for that
march, that, that forward movement of
[SPEAKER_01]: amber trichomes to just touch the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I can see that it's advanced up
the sugar leaf and is now there's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of amber showing on the actual flower
itself, that's, that's just kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: baseline for something when I want to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before, when I was being super
meticulous about it, yeah, like I think
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I would aim for is like 75%
cloudy, maybe just a little bit clear and
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before, before all that advanced
tech and microscope and shit, people would
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you know, 50% amber, 50% cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like, as Matt was saying,
when I first started growing outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what everybody on the forums was
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, that's what other people were
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just kind of a general rule of
thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, I'm trying to think of an
example where I think my, so I've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: brother who grows and he likes letting his
resin go amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, he feels like it gives them a lot
more couch lock, a lot heavier,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more medicinal value out of taking
care of, he's a, he's a farrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got aches and pains that I
couldn't even begin to describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, working with horses all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wants something heavy hitting that
knocks him out, something narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he likes letting his plants go full
amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a testament, anytime I smoke his
stuff, it's, it's strong, stony stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be due to him letting his
plants mature pretty full, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes back to subjectivity,
you know, what you want, changes for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for when you should harvest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So potentially this decision can be quite
a complex decision.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you have all these like subjective
preferences, your relative experience with
[SPEAKER_08]: those particular plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have these other competing pressures,
whether or not they're like environmental
[SPEAKER_08]: for you outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or they have to do with like your workers.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a team of people working for
you and when they're available and when
[SPEAKER_08]: you have the right dry space and it is
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really think about it from that
point of view, like that practically when
[SPEAKER_08]: you are making the decision, there are all
these other practical things that come
[SPEAKER_08]: into play as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can always make a plan,
but executing the plan, it almost never
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to work out the way you want it,
especially when it comes to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you always, you always think
it's going to happen this way and it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't lay out in the exact perfect way
that you'd wish it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something comes up, you know,
a family member shows up or something
[SPEAKER_01]: happens on the farm and everybody has to
stop everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, well, your workload for
that day is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, yeah, you got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got all compiled out on the next
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're dependent on the scale of
your operation, sometimes you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: that extra day is worth the work to,
to, to offer, especially with weather and
[SPEAKER_01]: pending and, and other issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did anyone want to speak to this idea of
like preference when it comes to harvest
[SPEAKER_08]: and like particularly experiences where
you've diverged from that, like sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: guideline of, you know, Amber trike
balance, you know, are there particular
[SPEAKER_08]: plants that you, any of you grow that
like, you know, that's not going to be the
[SPEAKER_08]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically last year, I had a black
cherry soda seed from a random seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company that I just tried and about week
eight before, like she still had another
[SPEAKER_01]: week and a half to mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it and I'm smelling the
plant and I'm looking at the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: structures and I'm looking at the resin
content and I can kind of just tell it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to be flower that I'm going to
smoke and that I'm going to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I, what I did is I checked,
checked the live scope of it, saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin was all clear and I turned it all
into fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a buddy who, who would take it and
turn it into live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could have let it mature further,
but the, I, the turf profile that it had
[SPEAKER_01]: and its immaturity before it had its
chance to fully mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was, was decent on its own, but I could
tell that the flower wasn't something that
[SPEAKER_01]: I would desire or something that I would
be able to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, took it all and turned it
into live, live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it, it, it got consumed way
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually you guys got to try some of that
at the, at the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some of that from that plant,
the live resin that you guys got to try
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that, and that was a shock call that
I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant, instead of letting it mature
fully, I took it early and, and use the
[SPEAKER_01]: live resin off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was much more enjoyable that way
than I think the actual flower would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's a, that's a good general
point about like, maybe knowing what ideal
[SPEAKER_08]: final form the product will take.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, are you, if you are doing
extracts, does it change this decision?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Broadly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like any of you who are, you know,
into resin and stuff, have any thoughts on
[SPEAKER_08]: this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it change your decision or I don't
know, washing or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my, all of my concentration has
been like low scale, like really small
[SPEAKER_01]: personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I'm still just kind of messing
around with it, playing around with bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have any, I don't have any
personal expertise on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need peaches here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say we need,
we need peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: To come and talk about, fill in,
fill us in on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say, I don't,
I don't make any special hashes,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I assume there's a reason why like
people cut their plants down extremely
[SPEAKER_07]: early.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, to get like nice white
hash and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that looks pretty.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm not entirely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the last person to talk about that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been told by, uh, Rosin,
Rosin makers to, uh, I've been told both
[SPEAKER_02]: by people making Rosin, like don't cut it
down early, cut it down when it's mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they don't care as much about color.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say color doesn't really matter on
the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other people are like,
it does matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, let's chop it 10 days early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's chop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's chop it a week early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because it'll be lighter colored and
that'll help sell it because for some
[SPEAKER_02]: reason, I guess the custies want,
you know, that clear, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: really light colored Rosin as opposed to,
um, any, anything that's darker or more
[SPEAKER_02]: Amber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, I'm not really a Rosin smoker,
so I don't have a preference, but he just
[SPEAKER_08]: mentioned that she didn't think it was
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like she felt like it was purely like a
fashion thing or like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely am small scale personal use
like kind of stuff, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I have for press and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've done a bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, just from like the general vibe
of people, like talking to people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: really into Rosin, it seems like,
um, uh, the harvesting for color and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: is literally just like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that has been pushed by like big
companies, like seven, 10 labs and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, that, you know, make Rosin and
sell it to, you know, dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that generally, you know, good plants
make like, like stuff that you would want
[SPEAKER_03]: to smoke and flower is what you want to
make Rosin out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two years ago, I grew some lemon
parties and I had a S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew five of them and I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two that were fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't identical, but side by side,
they were pretty hard to tell apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I let one of them go like 70,
60, 70% Amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I let it mature and I let the other,
it's sister plant next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled it a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I remember pressing Rosin from
both of those plants and continually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting people telling me that I should
put a warning label on the Rosin that I
[SPEAKER_01]: let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 to 90% Amber trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, I continually had people
saying, Hey man, that, that stuff is too
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband was passed out on the couch for
two hours, drooling on himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had, I had people telling me
that I should warn them about giving them
[SPEAKER_01]: that specific Rosin from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, there's a little anecdotal
evidence about, you know, choosing to let
[SPEAKER_01]: the resin mature a little bit longer for
some of the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, I see more people
want the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either live resin or fresh press,
uh, stuff that's a little more battery,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more white, has stronger turf
profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: People seem to be more interested in that
than Rosin that packs a heavy punch,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least from, from what I can see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put myself in that category.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, usually like when I'm assessing up
until like maybe even, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a month or two ago, I would find myself
assessing extracts why they're scent,
[SPEAKER_06]: like their inherent scent of just smelling
them, you know, like, Oh, this one's super
[SPEAKER_06]: terpy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I found out, a lot of these,
like the scent is only like released once
[SPEAKER_06]: you activate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like some of them are real terpy,
but you just don't inherently smell that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think since it's like most people's
first experience with hash is you pick it
[SPEAKER_06]: up and the first thing you do is smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably why that's a big deal and
seeing it, obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I guess they make machines now to
strip the color out of hash, which blew my
[SPEAKER_06]: mind that that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there, I think they kind of push
this narrative that it's like clean,
[SPEAKER_03]: quote unquote, that if your hash is clear,
like white, like lighter colored,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I don't know, you can interpret
clean, however you want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure what that means,
but, um, yeah, I mean, I think the general
[SPEAKER_03]: vibe is like, if you're going to make
hash, like grow your plant and to its
[SPEAKER_03]: maximum potential, make it the best that
you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will make the best concentrate
that you can make.
[SPEAKER_06]: The old theory of shit in, shit out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it feels like we're sort of like
rounding out this section on like harvest
[SPEAKER_08]: timing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to ask if y'all had any good
stories about, you know, that whether
[SPEAKER_08]: like, uh, horrifically early, horrifically
late.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
Anyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a bad, a pearly harvest or like a
forced late harvest or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess so.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and was there anything you could do to
like, you know, uh, mitigate it in any
[SPEAKER_08]: way, or I don't know, soften the blow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so used to like early seed harvest as
opposed to just like flower or late flower
[SPEAKER_06]: harvest, like getting the jump on
harvesting seeds was always my issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you see them forming and sometimes
they look more mature than they actually
[SPEAKER_06]: are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, you know, in the early days,
I would just pick seeds off the top and
[SPEAKER_06]: look at it and be, Oh, it's brown mature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hack.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like you hacked it all down and
there's like three mature ones on top and
[SPEAKER_06]: the rest are just shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as flower, it's kind of
different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'd say definitely had some bad
harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your worst?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think like out of all the The worst
harvest was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was due to a cold room and I had
switched from soil to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The winter had came.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my first run in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the plants were off the floor,
but I, the room was still just too damn
[SPEAKER_02]: cold at night, especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it wasn't heating up like it had
been in the summertime during the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, and it was also the first winter
run at this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, the roots were just cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants were just like all leaf with
like, you know, just skinny, skinny,
[SPEAKER_02]: narrow buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, real bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, real, but my first, but that was my
first bad harvest where like yield was
[SPEAKER_02]: like crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality was crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was also my last harvest at that
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been there for like a year,
but yeah, I mean, lesson learned,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and, uh, moved on, but like,
yeah, man, environment was super.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was, I was fairly new to growing
at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was still maybe like six years into
growing now, maybe like five years,
[SPEAKER_02]: four years, but it was my first time just
dealing with bigger rooms and different
[SPEAKER_02]: environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a basement grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it would never, you know,
lights were on at night, but it still
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't get that warm in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the lights were off all day and
it would just be freezing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even during the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my worst harvest ever for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's not like super obvious to a
lot of people like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: if it gets super cold, you're on your
roots that, you know, it's going to get a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot more leafy and thinner shitty buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, a lot of us are used to
dealing with the heat, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I was dealing with all
summer in that place and working on heat
[SPEAKER_02]: issues and trying to keep it cool during
the night cycle and cool during the days
[SPEAKER_02]: or during the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, uh, yeah, cold, cold roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would say is more important than
ambient temperature is your root
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're just not gonna metabolize
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to dry out as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easier to overwater.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just all those things it's,
it's more important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that even to this day and in
the greenhouses is I don't care how cold
[SPEAKER_02]: it is outside as much as I care about the
root temperature and getting that up and
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out how to manipulate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's massively more important
than ambient temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they were talking cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if it's too hot, that's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like ambient temperature definitely
matters, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as coldness goes, like,
I mean, it can be 55 degrees ambient
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, but if the roots are at 45,
you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the questions I get, uh,
in DMS about harvesting are, can I save
[SPEAKER_06]: like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: My room is like 109, you know,
can I do anything with these buds?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just like, like, you know,
like it's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to add that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, ever since I transitioned to LEDs,
that's like the first time I had to like
[SPEAKER_07]: actually warm my gross space at night,
especially like here in the Midwest where
[SPEAKER_07]: it gets really like fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just, it comes with its own set of
problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and that's one of them that I noticed
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like having to keep the rooms
warm at night, relatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't run into those issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never lived anywhere where I needed a
heater ever in a grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that growing in a cold situation to me
would be totally counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm always trying to make it cooler,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's a dangerous, so what would
Gerald determine to be a dangerous root
[SPEAKER_08]: zone temp?
[SPEAKER_08]: A little hill you mentioned like 45,
is that already like quite extreme?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a threshold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be way too cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might vary in green between greenhouse
and indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be able to get away with a little
bit cooler, um, in a greenhouse as long as
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting good sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say like 55, 55 is good
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could probably work with 50,
but 55 and then like in summertime,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll be over 60, 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I really don't check.
Say what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had to do a Celsius conversion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's quite, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help you with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, we're Americans.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't use those silly things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fahrenheit all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember how like, when people
wanted during the first purple craze,
[SPEAKER_06]: like people really like, we were like
feeding ice water to their roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's during the flush last couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I never did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I did it work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you know, not really, not
particularly, um, it had to be like a
[SPEAKER_06]: permit per I was trying to like OG cushion
stuff, like wasn't going to go purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, I heard of that, but then people got
air conditioners and.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the Bay area at the time where,
where, where I was at in the Bay area,
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody had air conditioners in their house
because it was never more than 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and it would cool off at night
always even in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but yeah, then people started getting
air conditioners for their indoor setups
[SPEAKER_02]: and could really turn the tents down on
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's all you really need
along with a good flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the flushing alone brings the color
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you just add cooler temps at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where you really get
them to purple up strong and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, the, the old, the old
techniques for purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, there's a couple of
techniques out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've probably forgotten a few,
but I don't bother with any of it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got, I mean, with, with genetics now,
like I can light depth stuff where it's 95
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees out every day and it still purples
up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People, people have figured that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics wise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever heard about the car battery
hooked up to the plant to shock it purple?
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's what I had actually heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the guy, I think he interpreted
shocking the plant as far as temperatures.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in his brain, he thought it meant
shocking.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about this in the, I think me
and local and Farmer Dan talked about like
[SPEAKER_08]: different forms of violence being applied
to plants and like what that means.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely one, it's definitely one
thing too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've messed around with just like,
you know, in that same vein is,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, in the winter time, it gets really
cold here, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll, I've like vented like pulls,
uh, like fresh air and from outside into
[SPEAKER_03]: my temp, you know, like super cold air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure if it, you know,
I'm not, I don't have enough experience to
[SPEAKER_03]: be like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This does this, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like you're doing something
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems like a cool thing to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that sums it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's about how it feels.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same reason I put copper coils in my
shit this year outdoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: why not?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to move us on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to move us on to how do you have
this IE.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think Kersh of the giants had a
couple of like questions here,
[SPEAKER_08]: like what time of the day, you know,
and I guess for indoor growers,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like, do you think that it's better
to chop in the dark and this and that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we can move on to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also the like, do you wet trim?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you dry trim?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all that stuff, all that good stuff.
Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who do I get to start this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go for Kersh of the giants to start
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, for me, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've noticed in my garden is like if
I go out to my plants and I try tying them
[SPEAKER_01]: up, let's say in the evening time or in
the middle of the day, hottest part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day or in the evening time, and I'm tying
up some branches and I get a little too
[SPEAKER_01]: too handsy with one and it snaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real brittle and it just it just
cracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that that that plasticity is
it has more plasticity after she's just
[SPEAKER_01]: had her water, her drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the morning, there's two times that
I've noticed in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is like maybe an hour before direct
sunlight actually hits them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drink, they soak up, they all perk up
and then the sun comes and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: endure the heat of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on my trail camera through my
time lapse videos, I saw right around
[SPEAKER_01]: midnight, one a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning, they'd all do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd all perk back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had all the fan leaves that lift up
and it looked like there was a second
[SPEAKER_01]: drinking phase going on during the middle
of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in my mind, I like to chop after
the plants have had a chance to drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether that be the morning just before
the sun hits them or late at night after
[SPEAKER_01]: they've had a chance to get a drink in
them, the branch plasticity, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: break as easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as brittle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, I think that there's just
more hydration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more fluid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more water going up the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in hang, what we most of us like to
do is we like to get a longer hang out of
[SPEAKER_01]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more moisture that you have in your
branches and in your fan leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: the longer hang you'll get out of out of
your cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so so to me, I'm maximizing how much
how I can slow down the process of the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture and the chlorophyll evaporating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of my plants that are all hanging on
lines in my room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I've been aiming to harvest after
I've noticed that the plants have had
[SPEAKER_01]: their drink when when there's more
plasticity in the branches, when they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't just snap and are super brittle,
like I noticed in the heat of the day or
[SPEAKER_01]: or in the late evenings before they've
they've had a chance to rest and drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the times that I like to pull my
plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as wet trimming and dry trimming,
I used to I used to take a lot of family
[SPEAKER_01]: off before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't have any real set methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd read on the forums and I'd talk to my
brother and ask other people what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody, you know, it's very
subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has their own specific way and
they think that their way is the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just started playing around with
different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've noticed is harvesting bigger
sections of the plant and leaving more
[SPEAKER_01]: family on gives me a longer cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets me hang on the line longer instead
of like a nine or a 10 day hang on the
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll push it out to 12 or 14 days hanging
on the line before I want to go in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and start bucking it down and taking it
off the line and getting it ready to go
[SPEAKER_01]: either in a big jar or a big old turkey
bag, depending on how big my plant is that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as like there's a little
bit of a topic we want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are thinking about bud washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, like, you know, people dunk in
their plants and cleaning it off before
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I do a lot of microscoping and I
spend a lot of time looking in on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, on the flowers, on the leaves,
on the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see near enough dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see near enough insect shells or
frass or husks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see enough stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see enough stuff on the plant to
warrant doing any washing, hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: peroxide dipping or any of that stuff that
I've seen people doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as for me personally, in my garden,
I get enough late season rains that it
[SPEAKER_01]: does a good job of cleaning the plants off
from the from the ambient dust that that
[SPEAKER_00]: settles on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you, Little Hill?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, ideally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do things different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'd like to night harvest,
harvest in the cool air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just think that's it's easier
on people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know vineyards down south of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of harvesting at night time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big reason they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's like they're dealing with
the different levels of the sugar and the
[SPEAKER_02]: acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, a huge reason they do it is just
heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like having the workers out there all day
in the heat is rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and for them, it's also a marathon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a sprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't you can't beat the shit out
of your crew, you know, on a tough three
[SPEAKER_02]: day harvest and then you know,
do it again, you know, and again for like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, six weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we start early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we harvest all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just depending on what's going on,
we might take a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's if it's super hot,
like we'll take a break in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day for like two, three hours just
during the hottest part of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then harvest till tarts at seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I yeah, I don't wash
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the plants to be I don't want
the plants to be parched at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether they got watered that morning or
the day before as long as they're they're
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine as long as they're not droopy and
limp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, packing it in being efficient
with space is really important.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I've heard of people letting the
plants dry out like in in their,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, pots or, you know, like giving
them some I've heard of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't seem right to me to have a
stress plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna like whatever potential it
has of, you know, cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think it would be best to catch
it in the morning when it's nice and
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy and hydrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that's just what makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any data to back any of this
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my intuition tells me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though I've heard I've heard you know,
drought stressing at the end can help
[SPEAKER_02]: bring out more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, if they die on the branch,
isn't that like oxidizing your bud?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, because it's I mean, it would.
[SPEAKER_02]: That process starts in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, that's you definitely don't
want light or just some Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: What one thing about the bud washing is
like, I mean, that shouldn't be a thing at
[SPEAKER_02]: all for indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, and honestly, I don't know
anybody that does it on any type of
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though I would question why they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have heard it actually, it increases
oxidation, and your shit turns brown
[SPEAKER_02]: faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know for a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I've heard it from people
that I guess tried it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, peroxide is going to
oxidize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, my definition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an oxidizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: So all this all this weed that I've been
getting from dispensaries all looks super
[SPEAKER_06]: hella oxidized.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just realized that, like,
oh, shit, that's probably why,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, it might just be old.
[SPEAKER_02]: That for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it out for indoor?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's sold as it's sold as indoor in
my LARS, but it was definitely outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like part of the time, some of this stuff
is definitely outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's, it's, it's November,
you can look at harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they have the harvest date on
the package.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't the harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: The harvest dates were so close to when
they were bought that it was just like,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, and I'm looking at oxidized weed and
going, hmm, hmm, this is none of this
[SPEAKER_06]: makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the whole going to say?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say that a lot of people
remediate it with like x rays and shit
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, at least that's what I've seen
here in my state in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're doing it there, the
irradiation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they do it to lower like d y m counts
and bacterial counts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been getting a lot of questions on
Reddit about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Australian Reddit asked me
anything I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, they're like, Hey, so what's
your opinion on irradiated weed?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, huh?
Why?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it just like overall kills the
character of the weed, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it like gives them clean results.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what matters in the legal game
set.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can grow a third testicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what happens if you smoke a
bacteria, any type of bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like we've bought weed, like that's
likely been worse than what we see,
[SPEAKER_07]: like on these panels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to invite local to kind of
carry on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just talk about some of the other
questions that y'all have answered about
[SPEAKER_08]: like, when do you chop and, you know,
trim?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one, I kind of like to chop my stuff
and the more like, not the morning,
[SPEAKER_07]: but like, once the lights kind of go off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, that's my morning, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because like, you know, I mean,
not directly after it's turned off,
[SPEAKER_07]: but once like, kind of all the heat has
emitted from the room and stuff,
[SPEAKER_07]: because there's like residual heat from
like the lamps and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I kind of, I don't want my plant
to be entirely dry, but I don't want it to
[SPEAKER_07]: be sopping wet.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like to do little things to kind of
prolong the amount of time that it's going
[SPEAKER_07]: to take to dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, I won't like a wet trim or
anything, like I'll leave all the leaves
[SPEAKER_07]: on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, I have an AC in the
room, so that really helps keep
[SPEAKER_07]: temperatures cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't the case at my last place.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's like a game changer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of added like five, it could add
up to five days to your dry if you want it
[SPEAKER_07]: to, you know, depending on how cold you
get.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also like, it was my summer,
so it was cool, but it was also like,
[SPEAKER_07]: not like humid, but it wasn't as dry as it
should have been per se.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, really anything to minimize the
amount of or maximizing the amount of time
[SPEAKER_07]: that it takes to dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll usually kind of judge that once
like the branches, not like branches,
[SPEAKER_07]: but like the buds will snap from the main
branch itself, because like, I find that
[SPEAKER_07]: that main branch holds some moisture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want that to be entirely dry,
because that just like kind of signifies
[SPEAKER_07]: that the buds that kind of dry out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say they dry up faster than the
actual stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, I don't want my stock to be too
dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like them to have snappage, a little bit
of crunch to the bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your take on washing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never had to wash a bud before.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see why people would do it
outdoor, like say there's like dust storms
[SPEAKER_07]: or like, you know, the the fires and shit
in California, like all the smoke and dust
[SPEAKER_07]: particles that can make a need for wash.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like what when we were talking about
this earlier, what Chris, the giant said,
[SPEAKER_06]: and if you want to repeat that a little
bit, the giants talking about the logic
[SPEAKER_06]: behind dipping in the same barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in the examples that I've seen
washing, it's generally a guy washing all
[SPEAKER_01]: of his plants from the whole harvest in a
single like 40 or 50 gallon olive barrel
[SPEAKER_01]: drum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, when I see that,
my first thought is, OK, your argument is
[SPEAKER_01]: you're washing dust off and you're washing
insects and frass and husks and wings and
[SPEAKER_01]: shells of insects that have died and left
carpuses on your on your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my first thing is I'm watching these
guys and they're dunking them back to back
[SPEAKER_01]: to back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not giving enough time for the
dust or the dirt to settle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's basically a slurry of dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now your water, hydrogen mix or whatever
medium mix that they've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second thing is the corpses
that insect frass is going to float to the
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every time you dunk your branch in,
you're redunking it on a pile of dead
[SPEAKER_01]: corpses and then mixing it in a dirt
slurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the whole the whole logistics behind
it never made any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time every time I've seen those
videos or those pictures, it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just all dunking it into one
barrel as fast as they can, handing it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the person and then putting it on the
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just as crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing I noticed in these like the
red AMAs were that a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_06]: understand that, like, before they're big
like, you know, let's say someone has a
[SPEAKER_06]: question about, you know, growing 20 acres
outdoor and they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: they have questions about, you know,
like, should I, you know, dry this or cure
[SPEAKER_06]: this in glass or blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, you didn't think about
where you're going to dry that shit before
[SPEAKER_06]: you grew it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that should be a major, major,
major thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the fuck am I going to dry all this
shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but most people, it seems like a
lot of these chads that started the hemp,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, shit and got into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't even take that into fucking
account.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like where where are we going to dry it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we got like a garage that can be
enough?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something I've noticed too is
people don't take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's been many pot growers
failure of harvest is not accounting for
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're going to dry it or like
drying it in carports or yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them thought they could just cut
it and let it dry outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of them, some of them
thought that they could roll it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some company going out there
convincing people you could just roll it
[SPEAKER_02]: wet into like this giant roll,
like a bale of like a sale of hay or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I believe I remember that company's
not around anymore because it's shocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I've seen people fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people fail with yielding more
than they thought they would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not accounting for dry space and just
having shitty dry space, like having to
[SPEAKER_02]: put up carports to dry in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just not having the like gumption
to realize that maybe you should try and
[SPEAKER_02]: insulate it or, you know, you're not even
using that space efficiently to hang as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as you can in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, uh, it, it's, it's definitely a
failure, not knowing where you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can happen indoors too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure you, you know, you, you trick out
your little, your grow tent or your room
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you realize that like,
Oh, I got to spend 10 more days hanging it
[SPEAKER_02]: in here because it's going to stink at my
house if I move it anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, or, uh, yeah, you need like a
separate dry tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need, you know, just like you need a
separate veg area if you want to,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you really want to, to, to,
to repack that room as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much, how much space would you give?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, let's say you're growing,
let's say it's a 10 lighter, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: How much space would you want to
incorporate for this 10 lighter for your
[SPEAKER_06]: drying space?
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you guys recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say about a third of that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, if you're in a, I mean,
what's, what's a 10 lighter, like a 10 by
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 room or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's, that's what 200 feet,
200 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a third of that would be like 66 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if like you figure you have one
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, over 10 lights, but if you stack it
three high, then you should be able to get
[SPEAKER_02]: away with certain space, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good rule of thumb too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I really just kind of like got a
ballpark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It like, I don't even have any real
calculations on, on, on space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know when I have enough and I know
when I don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of base it off of old rooms,
old dry barns, like, okay, I had this many
[SPEAKER_02]: lines or this much like, like linear feet
of line to hang on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need that same to hang, you know,
one green house or two green houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how I've gone in the
past general ballpark guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I definitely didn't have enough
space.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hang dry rooms set up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to let her answer the
questions first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause then the next section is going to be
all on like the actual drying,
[SPEAKER_08]: like quote unquote cure process.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so did you want to speak to the
earlier questions about chop times?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't think I have very much to
add.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys hit all the points that I
would hit as well, as far as cutting the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I just want them to look
brick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I like to just be
prepared, have everything there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to be able to be like cutting
them and hanging them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that stuff done as fast as
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be messing around with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing I would add
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little hell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can now talk about like the actual,
you know, drying and, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: quote unquote curing, uh, dry room setups
or that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will, I'll just say that,
um, I do my drying in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, some of you know, that I, you know,
am under like quite serious spatial
[SPEAKER_08]: constraints.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can only flower a few things at a
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can keep a few things, like a few more
things than that, but I can really only
[SPEAKER_08]: flower a few things at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and so I actually dry my stuff in the
fridge, uh, which some of you know about,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, and on the discord, like there's a
whole channel about drying in the fridge
[SPEAKER_08]: and what that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but just wanted to mention that as
like a point of difference here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also going to just answer that
question that asked about like dry size to
[SPEAKER_03]: like the size of your room on a much
smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, cause I don't have a 10 lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a one lighter in a five by
five.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I go into a two by four with
that, which I think pretty much falls into
[SPEAKER_03]: the, a third of your space, um,
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's like a really great rule
of thumb just to hit that nail on the head
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third of your space is a great rule of
thumb, but also like continually at me and
[SPEAKER_01]: me and little Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about this just last night
is like, when you, when you're sizing up,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you have the option to build your,
your dry room, always add like another 20
[SPEAKER_01]: or 25% on top of what you think you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every single time I've set up a grow
room and, or I picked a spot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: basement and I set up lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it and like, yeah,
this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then harvest comes and like,
shit, I could always use like two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: more lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's never been a time where
it's like, I couldn't have used the extra
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, if you have the ability to,
I would say build it bigger than your
[SPEAKER_01]: initial thoughts are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you'll see the benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do any of us here have a different opinion
than drying slower and deliver it is
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know the one of the episodes I
interviewed someone and they said they
[SPEAKER_06]: like to use a dehydrator and does anybody
else have a different method than slow and
[SPEAKER_06]: deliver it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've heard of people using freeze
dryers for flour, but I've not had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had it, never had any
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that that is something that's
out there as far as a super fast option,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, yeah, slow and slow is the
name of the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll add that that's kind of the whole
point of the fridge thing as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that for some people it's like a
weird fringe idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't, I personally can't say
anecdotally that I know it's any better
[SPEAKER_08]: than hanging.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but it's kind of what I'm constrained
to doing at the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but the principle is the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: The longer you can draw out that process,
the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're it's an exchange process and
the slower the exchange process of
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture and chlorophyll is the better the
end product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's not, I'm not saying
this is scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just what I've noticed from my
flowers, from my garden that I hang and I
[SPEAKER_01]: trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have a, if, if they have a longer
chance to hang on the line before branches
[SPEAKER_01]: are brittle enough to snap clean with no
fibers, I'm talking there, people will
[SPEAKER_01]: say, oh yeah, it snaps clean and I'll snap
it, but there's still a fiber hanging on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's not clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it needs to be an actual clean snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you held up a light and you moved
the, and you moved a branch to much,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to see some THC flutter off
into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it should be at a point where it's
that, that far gone, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: before, but at least that's what I like
when I'm trimming my stuff down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, little, we're just talking
about this last night as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there's something that people
don't, uh, don't consider is you'll go
[SPEAKER_01]: into your hang room and a lot of people
use these totes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 55 gallon totes with the yellow
lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll take their stuff off the line,
stuff them into the totes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a lid on it and say, yeah,
I'm going to trim this in an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they don't get around until it's
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that time it's spent in the tote,
rehydrated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're working with a little bit
wetter weed than what you would normally
[SPEAKER_01]: like to trim with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people, you know, so you can think
that it's fully out of moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it all in a tote, and then it starts
to rehydrate on itself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's now working with a smaller
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now, it's now has more moisture in a
smaller area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I've always aimed for lower and
slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's just benefited me and the
last six or seven years, I've had the
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome benefit of when I chop,
like the, when I'm chopping, it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously raining outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my barn gets a little moisture booster
boost and the, the ambient moisture fills
[SPEAKER_01]: the barn and then also affects the grow
room that I had built inside, inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, or the, uh, hang room that I built
inside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and that's for me, that's been a
benefit with the, using my, like using
[SPEAKER_03]: like a two by four tent in my scenario,
I, it's like a perpetual thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have the environment pretty much
controlled at a certain place that I
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of just let myself hang for,
um, you know, like it, it may take say two
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks to dry out, but I'll let it hang
another week or two, uh, just hanging in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, uh, you know, when I'm ready
to that again, like for me, what that
[SPEAKER_03]: allows me to do is like, just slowly work
through each plant and as far as like
[SPEAKER_03]: trimming or however you want to,
you know, do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I go into like, I like the Mason
jars that have, um, they're like Amber
[SPEAKER_03]: colored, you know, to like cut out light
degradation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, obviously if you're doing a ton of
stuff, that's probably not, they're like
[SPEAKER_03]: $5 a jar now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably not great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for my skill, it's, you know,
I really like them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So no dehydrator tech for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm shooting for as long as
possible, but I'm not doing any weird like
[SPEAKER_03]: burping or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally speaking, I I'm just trying to
leave it alone as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all agree generally that longer and
slower is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so with that, what's the average in
your room set up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if, and there's also, there's also a,
a little asterisk to this question as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, because I, my personal, uh,
hang room is like a 25 by 30 room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I were to hang, let's say only
three plants on one end of the room and
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, and I don't fill the rest of the
room, it's a totally different exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: of, then if I were to stuff the room
completely full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, there, there's, there's a
little bit of a nuance to discuss there
[SPEAKER_01]: about, um, the, and your, your hang room
will act differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how many plants you have
stuffed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that you should plan
in your harvest, depending on if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting everything at once,
or if you're staggered harvesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is something that you should,
and not only that, but let's say like in
[SPEAKER_01]: my room, I have, uh, 14 or 15 lines and I
put them in at the back and I harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetually and hang them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the plants that are done in the
back, when I bring in a fresh set of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for, uh, on row number eight,
or nine, those back plants will get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little moisture refresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question I want to pose is
generally what, if, if there's no outside
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental factors about how many days
does it take in your room before branches
[SPEAKER_01]: are snapping off clean and you're ready to
buck down.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's about 12 to 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have rain outside from the
environment, it's, it's usually a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of days extra on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll get 14, 14 days out of the
hang before I'm going in there and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I should, I should start bucking this
stuff down.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's a 14 to eight, like anal 21,
somewhere in there for indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm more like, I'm like 10 to 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the I've got, I'll definitely
rehydrate the room at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I, if I like fill one half up,
wait seven days, then fill the other half
[SPEAKER_02]: up, it's going to be, it's going to be
longer than 10 for that first half.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens all the time to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just slows it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm fine with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'd like to get things moving,
but you know, you can't really brush that
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, 10 to 14, I'd say I don't
want them to get too dry on the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends a lot on whether, like what
kind of plant you cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you have a lot of thick colas or
are they like longer extended branches
[SPEAKER_02]: with just all falls up them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because obviously those dry a little
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and I pack, I pack my weed in so
much that like, I might have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: six to 10 lines vertically going in each
section, six, six to nine lines deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a wall of weed with another
wall of weeds, nine inches behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another wall of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm only cutting like maybe 12 inch
to 18 inch branches at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the size branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is whether it's a lower branch
or a center cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, packing it in, like,
you know, my, my humidity skyrockets up to
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly up to 80.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it just ticks down
every day after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, usually at the beginning, I'll run an
extra dehumidifier or something just to
[SPEAKER_02]: cut it a little bit faster to get it into
the sixties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, I slow it down
because I don't want it to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, into the low fifties or forties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at least not for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, right at the end, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, if you leave it in that
kind of like low humidity for too long,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets brittle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I think you're just,
yeah, I think, I think, I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, you're helping yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're probably, uh, you're,
you're probably evaporating terpenes at
[SPEAKER_02]: that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the temperature wise,
I'm, I'm always in the sixties,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, usually mid to high sixties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know a lot of people say that's not
ideal, but bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've, I've cured, I've, I've dried in
all types of room, uninsulated,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in winter time, you know, uninsulated
in summertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've done it all different types of
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all different types of,
types of tricks to slow it down for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, I used to use an
evaporative cooler to cool my dry barn and
[SPEAKER_02]: it worked like it would drop the
temperature in there 10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would add a little bit of humidity
to summertime when humidity is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 20, 25% in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that, that extra humidity was almost
nothing, but it was still something and it
[SPEAKER_02]: still was able to slow it down and cool it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, I still, I still dried
good weed in that barn in summertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was the exact opposite problem
in winter time or in fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're trying to heat it,
but you're also trying to, you've got to
[SPEAKER_02]: have it warm enough in there to run the
dehumidifiers because your dehumidifiers
[SPEAKER_02]: might only work down to 50 degrees or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you, you know, it's much cooler,
colder than that at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know, just always,
uh, I have, I have a climate controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: barn now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also, it's also like, it was also a
new thing to learn because I was so used
[SPEAKER_02]: to hustling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and back in the day, like that trying
to keep your barn warm enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, definitely you were slow drying
and it was nice because it really worked
[SPEAKER_02]: out well, even though you're, you're,
you're hustling it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, working with, uh, air conditioners
and large dehumidifiers was also something
[SPEAKER_02]: to learn because you can over dry your
shit pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't stay on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so that's one thing I like to do
is as soon as I think it's ready,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's moisture meters you can buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use one anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the fire I did, I lost it in the
fire and I just never replaced it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they, they're used to, uh,
measure the moisture of lumber or
[SPEAKER_02]: firewood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you really want to get anal about
it, you can put the two little prongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that moisture meter on the stem on the
actual bud stem though, just to see where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have a number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people have used these things
for, uh, for helping their workers get the
[SPEAKER_02]: feel for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can look at a number instead of
just getting a feel for it or get the feel
[SPEAKER_02]: for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then look at the number to corroborate
like, okay, that's what 10% or 12% feels
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those were kind of helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a training people at one point,
I don't really do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the people I have doing it
have, have, have the feel for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've showed them and they understand,
they understand the whole thing about like
[SPEAKER_02]: what Kush was saying, I'm talking about
where you might have crispy buds and your
[SPEAKER_02]: stems might snap a little bit,
or maybe they don't at all, but just
[SPEAKER_02]: because your buds are crispy, doesn't mean
your plants dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you want to slow that process
down because all your water is moving from
[SPEAKER_02]: the main stem to the, to the secondary
stem, to the bud stem, to the flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then out into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you seal it up, everything's
going to redistribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the moisture is going to
redistribute evenly in that sealed
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that little extra water is going to
move through the flower into the
[SPEAKER_02]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that flower is going to get mushy
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're trying to store weed for any
period of time, if you store it wet,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to oxidize way faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to, it's going to smell like,
Hey, it's going to turn brown fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just did all that work for
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So figuring out when to seal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be used as a trick to get just
like a little bit of that extra water out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the stem is just to seal it overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then boom, open it the next day and
dried out, you know, flowers might go from
[SPEAKER_02]: mushy to crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only sealed it for like, you know,
12 hours and then seal it up again and
[SPEAKER_02]: then check it 12 hours later to make sure
you're still crunchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you're good and you
can do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really trying to dry it out and
store it for long periods, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you know it's going to be stored for
multiple months, which is something a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of outdoor growers do is they don't sell
their, they don't sell their harvest till,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, six months later after they
harvest it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good way to keep the color,
keep the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, it's definitely at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of extra work if you fuck it
up, because then you have to go burping,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 50 bins and who's got space even
to put 50 bins out, you know, space is a
[SPEAKER_02]: premium and, and so like hitting it and
checking it to make sure you did hit it
[SPEAKER_02]: the next day is, is really, really
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once they get sealed up in those bins,
you got to make sure you're outside the
[SPEAKER_02]: bin environment is not extra moist or
extra cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you want it cool, but you don't,
you've got to watch the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think outside humidity only really
matters if it's too high, because they
[SPEAKER_02]: will, it's not really sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's got time, everything's going to
equalize between your room, your and
[SPEAKER_02]: what's inside your bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's not really, really sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to keep all those things in
check.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't re go regaining moisture,
which, which, which it absolutely will do
[SPEAKER_02]: if you let it get, you know, more humid in
your room or coal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you're sealing in plastic jars
are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why jars are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're impermeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to regain any moisture,
but if you're in Turkey bags, like you
[SPEAKER_02]: need three Turkey bags to actually have it
sealed from moisture and smell for that
[SPEAKER_02]: matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're vacuum sealing, you need at
least two layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I I've seen dudes like
harvest and what they'll do is like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, stuff it all in those really
thin plastic, like Ziploc bags,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the sandwich baggies that aren't for
freezer, but like real thin and they'll
[SPEAKER_06]: sell it like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, you get it and you put it
in your jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then all of a sudden a day later,
everything's like moist and because
[SPEAKER_06]: there's still some air exchange in those
thin baggies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep that in mind too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if people are putting shit in thin
baggies, like it's not, it's not a good
[SPEAKER_06]: measure for if it's dry or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of moisture that can be kept
in there and appear dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two things that I wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is the different types of bud
and the preference in how wet or how dry I
[SPEAKER_01]: want them when I'm trimming them.
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, before, before we go onto
this course, can we hear from like local
[SPEAKER_08]: and earn about, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say, I really don't
have much to add here.
[SPEAKER_07]: If, if Kush was going to go on ahead and
speak, but I'm also not speaking for earn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to echo just what Kush said about
like how many plants you have in your dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dogs are talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, what I used to try to like
harvest out of my five by five and dry in
[SPEAKER_03]: my five by five.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, as your plants lose a little bit
of waterway, you know, after like the
[SPEAKER_03]: first day or so it's like, they don't take
up that much room in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found that even if I would like dial
my environment in like on my, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: via controllers and stuff, it would still,
they would dry out too fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just like never could get a handle
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I went to a smaller drying
space, it like really stepped my game up
[SPEAKER_03]: with drying my plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was like such a big thing that I
learned early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of wanted to echo it because
it really did help me a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also wanted to like, just give a little
very short outline on what it's like for
[SPEAKER_08]: me to dry in the fridge, just because I
think some people might be interested.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you guys think it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the principle is the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what changes is that obviously you're
not going to put your whole plant in the
[SPEAKER_08]: fridge and like as a single thing,
partly because it actually takes really,
[SPEAKER_08]: really long.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if you had the space to hang a plant
in the fridge, I don't know what kind of,
[SPEAKER_08]: like how long that would actually take to
try it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to remove, I do break my plant down
before it goes in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even then after breaking it down,
I'm leaving a bit of stem on every bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It still takes like two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's still already quite a decent,
you know, timeframe for drying.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of judging when it's done,
the kind of loose, the loose guide that
[SPEAKER_08]: Shawnee actually recommended was doing a
weight calculation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And looking for about 25% of the original
wet weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can of course follow it up with the
stem, you know, the stem kind of snapping
[SPEAKER_08]: test or like what degree of snappiness
it's at.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those are generally what I use to
determine like when it should move on.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting measuring by weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically every little, how it works is
that you break the plant up, you put them
[SPEAKER_08]: into like paper bags and you put those
paper bags in the fridge essentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's quite convenient is that I will
mark the original weight and the target
[SPEAKER_08]: weight before everything goes in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point, I just take them out
and put them on the scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can tell when the bags are ready
individually.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also try to keep it so that the,
I try to group the flowers by mass as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that you don't get, I think it's kind
of getting towards Kush's question as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you don't get different sized or
quality buds in one bag because you don't
[SPEAKER_08]: really know whether they're all drying out
at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas they're roughly the same mass,
you know, sort of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: ballpark estimate that, okay, it's
probably mostly done.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, like was there anything you
all wanted to know about the fridge stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, your bagging method, are you double
bagging or is it just brown paper bags
[SPEAKER_01]: into the fridge or the brown paper bags
going into another bag, like a turkey bag
[SPEAKER_01]: as a secondary?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what most people are doing is
just a single brown paper bag,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I have seen variations and myself,
I actually put them all into a cardboard
[SPEAKER_08]: box because I have to use our like actual
fridge and the cardboard box just kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: ensures that it has a little like micro
climate that doesn't get like destabilized
[SPEAKER_08]: as soon as someone opens the door of the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a little bit of a buffer.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have seen people use like pizza boxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen people use like more than one
bag.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it really does.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just one of those things where I
think you kind of have to tailor it to
[SPEAKER_08]: your particular fridge and like your
environmental humidity and everything
[SPEAKER_08]: because that all of that is going to have
an impact as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: My only question would be how does the
actual temperature impact curing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because like just thinking about the
basics with what Pichu was talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: with the freezer, keeping it in the
freezer will keep the turps and everything
[SPEAKER_06]: way longer than in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a slow degradation in the fridge,
but it's very, very slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering if there is what kind of
gaseous exchange goes on at that
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature for curing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I knew more about the science and I
should also qualify that this is strictly
[SPEAKER_08]: for the drying part.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I would consider this like
part of quote unquote curing.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just to get the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the idea is that at a certain
threshold of temperature, you are losing
[SPEAKER_08]: less in terms of like the volatiles and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, none of this has been proven to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said earlier, I've never
actually done a side by side.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love for someone to do it at some
point, but it's just, yeah, given the
[SPEAKER_08]: constraints, it's kind of one of the only
ways I can keep things going.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the relative humidity in the
fridge?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did check this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I could tell you off the
top of my head right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like 45 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be like 20 to 30 probably in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's low.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely good to have it in a bag
in that case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably different in that bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a little higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably higher in that bag, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably higher.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I guess the interplay with the
temperature is definitely something I
[SPEAKER_08]: don't understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously the low temp keeps it going for
much longer, but the low humidity also is
[SPEAKER_08]: like a counterpoint to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the humidity is relative to the
temperature, to the water holding capacity
[SPEAKER_02]: of the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely, even though it's low,
it's really cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really slowing it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the air can't hold that much water
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not the same as having it hot and
dry where it would dry out in a flash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's much different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, if anyone out there kind of has
more science and more knowledge about how
[SPEAKER_08]: that works or any theories about whether
it's good or bad, I would love to know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave a comment below, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll have to look up the study,
but I was just looking up a study about
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll leaching in cold temperatures
and that the chlorophyll, it was studied
[SPEAKER_01]: off of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So storms in the summer, the water would
have a higher chlorophyll count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas that same water in the winter
storm when it was cold would have a much
[SPEAKER_01]: lower chlorophyll count.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was talking about leaching
and how chlorophyll has a harder time
[SPEAKER_01]: metastasizing or having biosynthesis being
created under cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there could be benefits to the cold
temperatures, not allowing the chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: to operate in a negative way or staying
inside of the plant material.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's definitely one of the,
that low temperature affecting,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, various metabolic processes and
all that is definitely one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: contentious points.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like whether, you know, what's good and
what's bad about that compared to a
[SPEAKER_08]: conventional or more conventional drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, all that stuff is like a bit of
a mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to do the side-by-side
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the rate of oxidation is slower as
well, you know, when it's cold.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little Hill, try it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have one greenhouse to take down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you still have to take down this
year?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a greenhouse that has light,
supplemental lights, and it's mostly RS 11
[SPEAKER_02]: and Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: RS 11, boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: All fucking hype.
[SPEAKER_06]: 13 minute high, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a thing where like I was doing a
review and like, as I have the camera on
[SPEAKER_06]: me and as I'm talking, I smoke it and
within 13 minutes I am dead sober after
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking RS 11.
[SPEAKER_06]: It killed me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only smoked indoor and I wasn't
impressed and I already had the clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, I was still going to go
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm so not stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is usually the best run of the
year is this fall, this fall run that runs
[SPEAKER_02]: into November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you can get the colors and
just something about like low light
[SPEAKER_02]: levels, but also supplemental light and
like cold nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can, you can really do some cool
things in that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, um, I got it full of like a
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a shit about, but the
Skittles will be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skittles will taste great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm, I'm a super fan of, uh,
of, of that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and just as far as like head stash or
something to smoke, that's tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's what I'm into anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: So did you ever get to grow old sweet pink
grapefruit by any chance?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, would I like to have that,
that strain back and some working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only grew it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had an amazing funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very like horizontal grower,
lateral brancher, um, just lime green
[SPEAKER_02]: nugs, but, but like, just like things
don't smell like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the closest I can get to Skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like trying to compare it to, or explain
to someone who used to grow stuff like
[SPEAKER_06]: that is like grapefruity, citrus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Extreme, maybe closest to something I
would remember from SPG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the best grapefruit peel is something
I get from it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: SPG.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I wish I still had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still alive?
[SPEAKER_06]: The clone is still alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll work on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that man, like things don't smell
like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think it would blow people's minds
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of like how other shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't, it won't test 30, but you know,
still amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could just lie about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just send it to a lab that lies about
their test and just put that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they all do anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's every lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe well, maybe it's a 25 or yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're going to, I think we're going
to do the, that Z episode next.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that could be cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Chris, did you want to progress with
those questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, one of them was just kind of a
personal observation that I, like I
[SPEAKER_01]: personally like to do in my garden and it
goes back to Tremon and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: morphology of different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, so if I get a golf ball,
uniformity, nug plant, and all of the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: or conical triangular or golf ball,
decent uniformity, um, I like to let those
[SPEAKER_01]: dry out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I'm trimming these and it
requires a dense bud because you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a little rough with it, but I'll
hand trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't use a pair of scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, I, I'll put on a pair of black,
uh, nitrile powderless gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the bigger rounder golf ball
nugs, I'll pick the, I'll pick the water
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pick, just hand pick everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even sometimes if it's bristly enough
or if it's a, if it's, if it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's dry enough, you can just brush
your finger across some of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sugar leaf and it falls right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll do, I'll let, I'll let those dry
easier and it's easier to work with my
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have really big hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these scissors are tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hands cramp up if I use the scissors
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to a little bit larvier
strain or a sativa leaner or something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is just covered in leaf and as a pain
in the ass to trim, I won't let that
[SPEAKER_01]: strain get as dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have it just a little bit wetter so
that when I'm working with it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors and the buds, I can be a little,
I can squish the bud down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can morph it around a little bit and I
can work my scissors around the content a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, there's nuance to be had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, you, you can't just subjective
or objectively say that this is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: time to trim this, all of this weed,
because there are certain types of bud
[SPEAKER_01]: that is easier to handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That some you can trim just by your hand
and peeling stuff off and some that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need a pair of scissors for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, oh, and the other thing is the,
just the powderless gloves and working
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you guys like your scissor hash,
use the powderless gloves and do your
[SPEAKER_01]: charis, like finger hash, you know,
your hands will get coated with enough
[SPEAKER_01]: hash that you can take your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude, the chair, it's, it's some of the
best flavors in my opinion is making that
[SPEAKER_01]: scissor hash or that finger hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your hands are coated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite hash bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so easy to do with the powderless
gloves, whether you use latex,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrile, as long as it's powderless,
but the finger pressing, it literally
[SPEAKER_01]: comes off so easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only need like five or six thumb
presses before it starts collecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: material to itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the, it's just super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys aren't doing that,
if you aren't trimming your stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: those, with gloves like that and capturing
some really nice charis and some good
[SPEAKER_01]: resin, I suggest doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just quickly though, what's charis without
your skin oils?
[SPEAKER_01]: Skin cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say it's traditionally
like, yeah, you're getting, you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: all the, all the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just one of the things I wanted
to pull back and talk about, and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of us have had a friend or
know somebody or have had this experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go over to a buddy's garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's growing a really good weed,
amazing weed, maybe even better weed than
[SPEAKER_01]: you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, dude, good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up, make sure everything's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two weeks after harvest and after
cure, and he's like, man, I, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this shit's dried out too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think we've all seen it where
somebody grew really amazing weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: took the diligence to grow the plant all
year long, and then just slacked off when
[SPEAKER_01]: it came to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curing and hang.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all anecdotally have stories of
friends or people we know that killed it
[SPEAKER_01]: during the grow and then slacked off at
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I just want to reiterate,
like, take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do, do the due diligence,
make sure your grow room is set up,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you have the space and the time
planned out for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have the time to trim it
when it's ready to be bucked off the
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have personally seen so many good
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally just fall apart because the
gardener at the very end just,
[SPEAKER_01]: just either hit a complacency wall or just
didn't take the, the curing harvest and
[SPEAKER_01]: the hanging process seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's as important and meticulous as
the grow session all year long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happens in a much smaller crunch of
time, but it's just, it's just as
[SPEAKER_00]: important in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to add to the, the Jara's part,
what I learned from our homey at Zomia
[SPEAKER_06]: that goes over there and like does that is
that a lot of those dudes that actually do
[SPEAKER_06]: the Jara's, their, their hands don't
really have a lot of skin cells come off
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore because their hands are so fucking
callous from dealing with the caustic
[SPEAKER_06]: turps of, and the cannabinoids or
cannabinoids or whatever of, of that
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their hands are just so fricking callous
that not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't have pores.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no natural oils coming out of
their hands because their pores are
[SPEAKER_01]: clogged.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds brutal, but like I thought about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you think about just like getting,
getting, you know, rubbing against plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, oh, bare arms, sometimes it can get
really itchy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like when you're having a heavy
trim session, your balls are itchy and
[SPEAKER_06]: you, you know, the sensitive parts of
your, that shit could suck, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Were there prompts in there for the
others?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, just like, just the nuance I've
noticed between trimming different
[SPEAKER_01]: morphology, like suggestion for the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to capture, capture your
scissor hash and your trim hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, using the gloves and then just
reiterating the, you know, take a step
[SPEAKER_01]: back and make sure you're the,
the latter portion, your last 20% is as
[SPEAKER_01]: important as the 80% that you grew all
year or the time that you took to grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, whatever your frame is,
you know, take care of the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't slack off on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of failures just because
people were like, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get around to it or it doesn't have
to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew this fire looking weed,
you know, look at this is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it doesn't turn out like they
thought it was because they didn't take
[SPEAKER_01]: the last portion of it seriously.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a lot of growers who are,
um, who think they're shitty growers
[SPEAKER_06]: because they're not very good at drying
and curing and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a lot of people who think
they're great growers that are shitty
[SPEAKER_06]: growers and kind of do okay at the drying
and curing part.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say that like as a relative
newbie, um, it still scares me not knowing
[SPEAKER_08]: whether or not if, if I get some flour,
that's not so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I, it's still not very clear to me
whether or not I messed up in the post
[SPEAKER_08]: harvest at this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I'm not talking about clones that
I'm rerunning that already know,
[SPEAKER_08]: of course, I just mean like, you know,
new, new plants that I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, is that because I messed up at
the end?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to rerun it and see if
it's the same or, you know, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_08]: have to try and vary something in my dry
cure to see if it makes any difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I guess what I'm trying to say is that
like, I don't feel like I have that much
[SPEAKER_08]: certainty when it comes to the end product
quality and knowing like exactly where
[SPEAKER_08]: things may have gone good or bad yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping to like, obviously develop that
over time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but it's so complex that I'm like,
oh, this could have gone wrong at like any
[SPEAKER_08]: of these points.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could just be like a shitty expression
from the genetics and that's just how
[SPEAKER_08]: it's, it could be the genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm still, yeah, still getting there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still working my way there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I thought otherwise we could just open
the floor, like anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: anything that comes to mind for you guys
around any of these topics, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: any of your, any reflections on like your
most recent harvest, anything like that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw the indoor guys
under the bus a bit and say one of you has
[SPEAKER_08]: to respond.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I was kind of going to ask actually,
um, do any of you guys look at like the
[SPEAKER_07]: pistol development at all, uh,
in terms of like looking when to harvest
[SPEAKER_07]: and all of that, or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of just something like I've
never really used it, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of just see that it like correlate
for heavily.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like if, if I still see white
pistols or stigma at the end of harvest,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm, I'm thinking that I
probably screwed up somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I know that this should be done and I'm
seeing a bunch of, you know, my hair
[SPEAKER_06]: sticking out, but at the same time,
like there are some plants that will never
[SPEAKER_06]: stop throwing that like Kim 91 stuff like
that when it's grown, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, Hey, it's up in the air just
where you like to hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that the Kim 91 S1 that I
got going out right now, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has like one or two white pistols still
sticking out the top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she actually, she retained a couple of
her pink pistols too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This laid into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really surprised to see pink,
like on the top of every Cola,
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three pink pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I'm used to seeing those fade away
pretty, pretty early into flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's, there's a lot of strains that
do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, you just kind of have to know
which or which, like I was talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: the Bundy sis S1 cut earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing will do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like endless, ugly ass white
hairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it got shocked, you know,
like one of the traits of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess it just depends on the
genetics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the way some, some strange just
do, I mean, most of them tend to the hairs
[SPEAKER_06]: die off and, you know, it's, you know,
maybe not time to harvest, but you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's at least been pollinated or hand
fumbled or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's, it means all sorts of different
things when the hair sprout up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Too hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I look at is like, once most of
the hairs are turned, like, like a
[SPEAKER_02]: majority of them, especially on the tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that like harvest is probably about
two weeks away.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least this is, this is outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like once they all kind of turn,
then you're going to start really to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're really going to start seeing
swelling in the nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're still about two
weeks away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see a lot of pollen contamination
out where you're growing outdoor?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like from other farms?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not where I am at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless I'm contaminating myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in town, like down in Garberville or
Redway, if you're growing in your
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard, like you'll get seeds and
everything every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be so mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some years, some years worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like people are like, some people
are flowering males out in their backyard
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring up to their, their garden up,
up somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's town and there's weed in
everybody's backyard and you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of garbage they're growing or
Hermes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that's fairly common in town,
but out here, just especially where I am,
[SPEAKER_02]: no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I'm, there's, there's nobody
really growing weed very close to me and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very windy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I've never had an issue with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a neighbor with a male plant I
saw one time and I just kind of barked at
[SPEAKER_02]: him to fucking cut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I would do it for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is random.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, I had a herby plant this year in my
Skittles, Skittles Sherbert cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them straight up her made more male
flowers than, than female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I caught it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught it early enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't, I haven't really trimmed up
that weed yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if it's seeded,
but I kind of doubt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just from looking at all the male flowers
and, and the weed around it, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the, the females around it,
like I'm, I don't, I don't think it her
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think it seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, like, yeah,
pretty good way to fucking get on your
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor's bad side.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a bunch of stray pollen
running around your property.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say like, have you all
witnessed or heard of any like spiteful
[SPEAKER_08]: individuals who've gone and like
pollinated someone's garden because they
[SPEAKER_02]: were not pollinated, but, but if a
neighbor had pollinated your garden
[SPEAKER_02]: accidentally and there's most likely
that's, that's definitely happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that, that can cause some
problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard a lot of lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard some stories in Trinity Pines
where guys were using drones and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinating other people's farms with
drones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like epic eight, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity Pines is pretty crazy though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets pretty wild up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bunch of dicks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot of lawsuits,
especially during the hemp stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it was, you know, hot hemp or,
you know, like it's supposed to be femseed
[SPEAKER_06]: and all of a sudden it's all pollinated.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people like Chad suing,
like the, the people they had do it or
[SPEAKER_06]: whoever, cause they didn't understand what
feminize meant or any of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that was pretty common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also they were, they were putting out like
really on, on untested seed for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that, that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time in Applegate Applegate Valley in
Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bunch of hemp farmers in the Valley
fucking seeded up everybody since Amelia
[SPEAKER_02]: crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, I think that caused
cause some problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could only imagine if somebody seeded my
crop, what would happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't think I would sue them,
but like, you can't fuck with somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: livelihood like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and honestly, like there is,
you are liable.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the, in the era of legalization,
you're super liable for ruining somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural crop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if the person's legal,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still liable to catch an ass whooping.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a question also for you outdoor
growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, once you guys see like botrytis
and whatnot on an outdoor crop,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that like signs to harvest that right
now or kind of just cut it and let it go
[SPEAKER_07]: and harvest it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like, how do you guys deal with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how close to harvest are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it, your botrytis could have been
caused by caterpillars, in which case cut
[SPEAKER_02]: it out and let it ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, if you see botrytis,
like you might go another week before you
[SPEAKER_02]: see botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, on the same plant or on the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that case, you just got to start
monitoring and looking closer once you see
[SPEAKER_02]: it until it gets to the point where like,
okay, I saw three new spots today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow I'm going to see 10 new spots,
cut it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it kind of progressively gets
worse and you got to know when to cut your
[SPEAKER_02]: losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also think that's the harvest time
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I think we're going to, you know,
we got 10 spots of mold today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, let's harvest tomorrow because it's
just going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, that's your harvest timing
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's molding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it also depends on infection
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's in the base of a main
cola, as opposed to a lower tier branch or
[SPEAKER_01]: a little snug, or if it's on the main stem
near the, near the base of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the, I've noticed in my garden,
usually it only propagates where there's
[SPEAKER_01]: dead cell material.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's dead plant material for it to
grow off of, or in the instance of
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars, it's, it's their shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that the, the, the,
the proliferation of it starts where their
[SPEAKER_01]: shit is just resting on the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of depends on the infection
site depends on if I take that branch or
[SPEAKER_01]: if I take just the tip of the cola off or
if I take the whole thing or if I take the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just, just the tip.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I had a question about botrytis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this one's for Loco because I
think Loco and I had a little talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how long ago, but so far,
mostly when we talk about botrytis,
[SPEAKER_08]: we consider it to be like an exogenous or
like kind of caused by like exogenous
[SPEAKER_08]: factors, like caterpillars, humidity,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Loco, you were, you mentioned to me
that there was also a notion of systemic
[SPEAKER_08]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if that's the right term
for it, but was that something we were
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, I think it's kind of like never
really been settled if it's systemic or
[SPEAKER_07]: not systemic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really- What do we mean here when
we say systemic?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like systemic, I guess, it's like if,
if one part of the plant has it,
[SPEAKER_07]: like the rest of it is or can't have it
type of deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else from anyone?
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think like what you guys have
been talking about are been great points
[SPEAKER_03]: and just like what Kush was saying,
like the biggest thing that has helped me
[SPEAKER_03]: is to just be prepared for what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like know like how many plants
you're going to be taking down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you have a space ready for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, make sure you have your
environmental kind of like thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: like environmental controllers and stuff
like that in place before you go,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because once you, once you take
them down, they're drying, whether you
[SPEAKER_03]: like it or not, whether you're in good
conditions or bad, you know, so just be
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that's the best way you
like to set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one other thing I wanted to add was
people who are very meticulous about
[SPEAKER_01]: scoping trichome, amber and cloudiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't take into account
that when you chop the plant and hang it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that maturation still goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it varies with strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies with environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some that have 20% amber
trichomes jump up to 40 by the time hang
[SPEAKER_01]: is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen some that only add like 5%
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's another nuanced subjective,
like you have to, you have to get in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and work with the plants to
understand what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've wondered about this too, especially
because it takes so much longer for me to
[SPEAKER_08]: dry in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I often have thought about that,
like whether or not that, that process,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, obviously it will continue,
but at what rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if nothing else, we can probably
call it a wrap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think we're right about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then possibly maybe an idea for the
next episode is, uh, just talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: what we grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for an outdoor round table,
what we grew this year, what we liked,
[SPEAKER_01]: what worked well, what we might go for
next year and get a, get a, get another
[SPEAKER_01]: hour and a half, two hour discussion going
on that, because I could talk about plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: of that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already excited for next year's grow
and I'm not even done trimming this year's
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm chomping at the bed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm definitely ready for something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like off season content.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I imagine this, there's a lot of
prep that you guys have to do anyway in
[SPEAKER_08]: the off season thinking, planning,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that could be cool for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see you guys go through the jars
and like describe each one as you go
[SPEAKER_06]: through it and what nuances you look for
and how you assess your weed and like all
[SPEAKER_06]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I think people would be really into
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that seems to be why they like the
reviews that I do is because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: someone that has experience with
something, giving them a real realistic on
[SPEAKER_06]: the ground idea of what this thing smells
and tastes like and all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think people would be into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call it, call it like a jar talk,
have a round table called jar talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to kind of credit Kush,
by the way, for this episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, he actually wrote up a bunch of these
questions and the outline and I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it's the first time someone else has
done it instead of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, maybe the next one you
may, we may not need both, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: me and Matt, maybe one of us, maybe you
could take the reins fully Kush at some
point.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see in the future getting more outdoor
cats on, and there might be a panel big
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to where both of you guys don't
even need to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have enough people talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to be in any outdoor episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a idiot outdoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: All I got are dumb ass questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all I got.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, with that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to thank each and every one of
you for showing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, is there anything you have to say,
Ern?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to plug?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for letting me hang out with you
