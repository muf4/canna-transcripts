[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_00]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_00]: Noxodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_00]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start righting some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice with a lot of our
interviews, it kind of just jumps into a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation, and this will be no
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ending will probably be no
different as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apologies in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our conversations are all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of us with ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, welcome to Breeder's Syndicate,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with my friend ShawneeKids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are here with New York Peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was the, I guess you would say,
owner, runner of Compassion Clubs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s in Canada, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're still going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started the, originally it was called
the London Compassion Club back in 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went public in with Alan Rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would have been like 97 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's when I split off from
Hemp Nation and did the Organic Traveler,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was my retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they call me NYPD just because my name
is Petey Pete and I'm from New York kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's they don't call me New York
Pete, but they call me NYPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: NYPD, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always scared to lead with that
because I remember when the first time I
[SPEAKER_00]: heard it, I was like, NYPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a whole bunch of fucking NYPD
paraphernalia, like the shirt and the hat
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But where we're from, it's like everyone
had a nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my name is ShawneeKids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Pete has only really known me as
ShawneeKids going back to the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our friends had nicknames.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone had a nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of had to in this industry,
though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, I didn't want to say,
hey, fucking Sean, fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or Chris Clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or fucking anybody's real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're the king of shortening
words, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I fucking mixed up everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's evolutions of people's
nicknames that I know has a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something like Bongboy worked for
me for years, no idea what his fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: real name was.
[SPEAKER_01]: No fucking idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll admit that on my birth certificate,
it does not say not so dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tour names.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different nickname.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different way, you know,
for being in a semi shady, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: quasi what, you know, anywhere from
completely illegal to quasi legal to gray
[SPEAKER_04]: area to maybe, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always said, you know, we have we
I've always lived in the gray area of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's really dark gray and
sometimes it's really like gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I've I've had a deal in
the black market because I needed to to
[SPEAKER_01]: suffice or to satisfy the need of the
medical communities that I was part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't grow enough for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and that's really why I started growing
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one not to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to save money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started Organic Traveler in a
university town, I had the Grow Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuition campaign, which was I would sell
you seeds and give you information,
[SPEAKER_01]: sell you grow guides, come back,
come in on any Sunday and we would have
[SPEAKER_01]: grow chats and walking through how to do
cuttings or start seeds or stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because money in your pocket, whether you
save it or make it, is still money in your
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, don't get into this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fucking honestly, you know,
I I won't work with anybody back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, especially when cannabis was illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your sole income was strictly on
growing pot, good on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you're not going to be in my circle
because I think, you know, if you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of prostituting the the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always been a big advocate about,
you know, not prostituting this plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: like use it for what it's meant for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was put forth for us to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to, you know, bastardize and and
prostitute kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've made my entire living off of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also had Organic Traveler,
which was a head shop that was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I got busted, which I have,
and end up in jail, which I have,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they take everything that I own,
which they did, my rent was still paid and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was still food on my table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I had hemination or sorry,
Organic Traveler, or before hemination,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, hemination, I was delivering meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fucking delivering meat every
morning from nine or eight in the morning
[SPEAKER_01]: till four in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come home to my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my gravy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fucking shitty fucking day job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put food on my table, paid my rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all the gravy in life,
my two thousand dollar bike hanging on the
[SPEAKER_01]: wall, my trips to fucking Amsterdam or
California, wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever the fuck I want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, you know, and it's not from being,
you know, a dick about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I grew pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have a harvest party and I'd bring
all the staff in from Hemp Nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, what do you guys want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to I'm honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm charging you double what I charge
medical so I can sell it cheaper to the
[SPEAKER_01]: for people that need it over the people
that want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you tell me what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will pay for it in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want two ounces or three ounces
or QP, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You I'm going to take the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put in one of those
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick it in my deep freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you come to me with a quarter ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifty bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but that pot is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not selling it to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A generational thing, too, because like
when I I felt like where I, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: where I grew up, at least it was really
important to have some kind of verifiable
[SPEAKER_04]: income.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you had to have some reason of
existing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to have some way to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't want to go to court.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, how do you support
yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it comes from an era where
like you it had to be a side gig because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you needed even if it was just
even if it was just a front, like you
[SPEAKER_01]: said, like you had no like organic travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all a front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I fucking never made money
out of organic travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost it when it got to a point of losing
about 40 grand a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, OK, we're pulling the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that time, you know, I was doing
the Compassion Society for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 20 years, the cops knew what I was
doing, you know, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in diva came into play and diva came in
into play as I was closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic like I same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: C.R.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you kind of need to have a reason for,
like you said, what people see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it's for what I see and what I
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cut ties with some really fucking
great growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I cut ties with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I were just fucking assholes, you know,
and it was just their focus was money,
[SPEAKER_01]: money, money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you chase it, you know,
you open to yourself up to the you're more
[SPEAKER_01]: vulnerable to be taken advantage of or get
busted or, you know, get shady,
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with shady people, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pretty lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been in this industry for a
long time, 30, all of my 30, 40,
[SPEAKER_01]: 40, almost about 35 years, you know,
that I put my name out there and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I'm a fucking pot guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And London, London is a pretty
conservative place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was really different than like
that's why most people went to B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: because everybody left B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they may be like,
oh, B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: grows the best pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, fuck, you know, like I went out to B
.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived out there and I didn't meet
anybody from fucking B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not there on grow contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it was what we have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems like it kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the marijuana movement started
around here and we are in a very
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back when I started, we had a very
conservative religious mayor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I wanted to make a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put up big banners that said the Lord
believes in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you believe in the Lord?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it was not something that
she took kindly, but would not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, make a stink about it because
she would be giving me airplay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, more o'clock in the morning,
the fucking paddy wagon showed up and took
[SPEAKER_01]: down my fucking banner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you've been doing this a long time
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like the one thing you've been doing
also is like fighting the law openly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like since what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 93, you've been constantly or like I
think is when the constitutional
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I still talk with Alan Young on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's that poor man's been beat the
shit up in this fucking industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is he?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan Young is the I say the cannabis
lawyer in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and so he's the one that handled
Chris's case.
[SPEAKER_01]: His partner, Paul Bernstein, he handled
like Ross Rebo roll a big doobie whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: the fuck his name is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the West Coast, you have John
Conroy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hear constitutional lawyers,
you're dealing with Alan Young.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to explain that the whole
Chris Clay arrest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was part of Hemp BC, but in the
shadows, luckily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first time we got raided,
it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with with Chris, very educated,
well read, polite kid who didn't start
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking pot till just a few years prior,
read the law and the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that the law was read is it wasn't
cannabis that was illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC is not in the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I met him, because I was
going back and forth from New York to St.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thomas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or London, because I was in college and I
was bringing seeds back and forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: just trading for genetics for genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was helping him with the little
great Canadian Emporium seed fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he realized, well, cuttings don't
have fucking THC in them either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he took out a fucking full page ad in
the sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've seen magazine that said
overgrow your government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure that Chris,
well, would have been Andrew, who was the
[SPEAKER_01]: artist, coined that phrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overgrow your government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like it was literally a cartoon
of a seed marching with a helmet on,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Hemp Nation flag on it,
holding a bong like it's a gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and we said we're going to
sell 30 skunk one cuttings for 30 bucks or
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 for 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think by the seventh cutting or
something along that line, Jordan,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's the little person, I think is a
proper name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Howard the Duck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was Howard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he I just reconnected with him,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's back in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they read he was the one that
actually sold the cutting to an undercover
[SPEAKER_01]: cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must have brought Howard the Duck
sold the cutting to an undercover cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was arrested.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chris was arrested because he was the
owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was his name on the lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jordan got arrested because he was the
actual one that did the the sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and yes, they must have bought the
cutting and then brought it down because
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't buy it and then bust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bought it and then came back a little
bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Chris would be the better at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was smoking a lot of pot back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris was smoking a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had dreadlocks, actually, back then,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and they all did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan had Jordan was like a little
person, but he had dreads down to his ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had like a lip thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still trips me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Howard the Duck, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was only Howard for like a very split.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tried to remove a lot of it because he
was underage.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched a documentary on it the other
day on the making of Howard the Duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't mention him, do they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked about how like they hired him
and he was a little kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they initially shot a bunch of it
with him, but the movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have removed a lot of the dummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to move it, remove them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's in hell if it was him or not,
because, you know, if you can you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: email me that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way we're talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in something modern, too,
with like Colin Farrell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched it from Irish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and Bruce is a great movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate to say, but I and I joke with
him, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, listen, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of all look alike kind of thing
because there's so many people that times
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, fuck, I'm pretty sure that's
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I don't know if it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to go look at the fucking credits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, oh, it's not him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, it's just and then
Prozac back in the day, which was another
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the kind of I wouldn't call him a
Klingon because he was part of the he was
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp Nation family.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, obviously, Pete Rocks was
and Pete Miller and I can there was and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a whole bunch of whole bunch of
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, getting back to the bus,
they they must have took the plant out,
[SPEAKER_01]: brought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't analyze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just maybe confirmed that it was
cannabis and came back later that
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon and raided the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't take any of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't say anything about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Busted them for paraphernalia,
paraphernalia, the two six two point two
[SPEAKER_01]: and the and for the distribution of
controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like back then, it would be called
something different back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he was a PPT, like the
possession for the purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, they, you know, cleared out
the store, fucking made a mess of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically trying to shut him down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they didn't realize Chris had
really supportive parents that had money
[SPEAKER_01]: and believed their son not to be a fucking
criminal like he was treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the Elmwood house, we had a grow
house on Elmwood that everybody lived in,
[SPEAKER_01]: except for me, because I actually I was
delivering meat at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and, you know, they went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they busted Prozac and his
girlfriend at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was fucking a shit show of
craziness, because as soon as the cops
[SPEAKER_01]: busted us, the phone calls started going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that was at the house was
literally like running to the basement,
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbing pots, running out the backyard,
throwing them over the back fence into an
[SPEAKER_01]: empty lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time the police got there,
there was literally a trail of dirt up the
[SPEAKER_01]: stairs through the kitchen, out the back
door and dirt still on the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were throwing it over and they were
just like, they were like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: not on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not our problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so so that that was the first
bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then since they didn't say anything
about the seeds, Chris and Chris and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris and I got a little bit more serious
about it and started to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more into the breeding, buying,
like you say, showing those some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: early sent to seed packs and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that was going over there,
maila seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when did we start buying seeds like
you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you tell me that you were the first in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I think Chris was the first
seed company in Canada because I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know anybody else that was publicly
selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way before Dark Enemy, Mark, Mike up
north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They removed a whole chapter from my book
because they were so scared that he was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to sue me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Us kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's a fucking douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mike up north at Crosstown,
he was early in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Dom ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Dom never got into the seed thing out
west.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nobody really out west that we
knew of.
[SPEAKER_01]: MPC wasn't even around at this point in
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as I knew, yeah, it's Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris was the first one to stick his
fucking little neck out there to to to
[SPEAKER_01]: spread the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to overgrow the argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and when they busted him the
first time, they they didn't do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we figured fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we we know where the limits are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's ball to the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the seed fucking business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start spreading the seeds fucking
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we started that's when I was
hired to work in the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every Sunday I would do cultivation
counseling, wherever the fuck they wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to call it, with NYPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it was a it was the point that,
you know, we started getting noticed and
[SPEAKER_01]: we started getting people traveling to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Chris got on the Internet and
everything back then was raw code and
[SPEAKER_01]: started producing the seed menu online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fucking we were getting more
hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point, if I remember correctly,
he said we were getting more hits than
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Western Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had so many fucking people that
just heard what you can buy cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, because we were in the
newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to put that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives us credibility of who we are
and what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they came back the second
time, they offered Chris a a a way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: An option is yet to to plead guilty to
lesser trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Chris came to us and said,
it's up to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we're we're a nation at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were treating ourselves as a nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we had minister.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was minister of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a minister of labor,
which was Bill that took care of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: retail store and all the all the staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had minister of education,
which was Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she took care of the library and the
museum and and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Andrew was the minister of
defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was our artist, but he was the
angriest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was he just he was he's a brilliant
he's a school teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was scared to share with me now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his wife owns from Mars, which is
another staple in this town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so we were set up as a
nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were ready to like they call this war
on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to take it as a war on
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a war.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we formed our nation and we were ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and this is like early 20s kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're all like in your early 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the 90s still.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be late 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been like mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I opened up organic in 97.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and we were and Chris was already
banished from Ontario by that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing was, is after the first
raid, like I said, we went balls to wall
[SPEAKER_01]: to the with the seed and seed business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we started again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going through Amsterdam,
sell it, send a seed so I can breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was doing what what the fuck's the
big douchebag in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you on?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, he's he's a nice douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it's an arrogant douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's the most this is the most famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He threatened to sue us as legends for
when we were entering the cup with the he
[SPEAKER_01]: thought we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was always good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were using Neville seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hank, Hank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hank is the type of fucking guy that
started doing what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but being a dick about it,
I would I would openly say, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: listen, we got in 20 seeds of skunk one
from from the drunkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm open breeding those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the same room, we had an original
haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a black domino.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had all these other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you're going to get when
there's no guarantees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get your grown pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now you're officially a pot
grower and they're they're good genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and not, you know, from where I started,
my genetic selection was from bags of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd get fucking and New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not getting the fucking best weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting fucking Jamaican brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I first started, we were buying
nickel bags in East Rockaway on B15,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is actually in a Beastie
Boys song.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for five bucks for a nickel bag and
ten bucks for a dime bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would get, you know, a third of it
was seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was back when it was after people were
saying buying it by the lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like four fingers in a fucking in a
sandwich bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were basically going and buying
nickel bags for five bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would get a shitload of seeds in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was good pot, I would save the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know what the fuck it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what sativa was or indica
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all fucking Jamaican fucking
shit weed or Colombian or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we got certain things and people
like, oh, it's aqua, powerful gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, I'm going to keep the fucking
seeds because I heard that back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: high reading in high times magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started collecting those genetics and
I would bring them up to Canada and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would trade with with Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would have his seeds from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: London is a fucking phenomenal place for
cannabis for multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, because we did have the Perth County
conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot of the draft Dodgers that
came to Canada, didn't want to go too far
[SPEAKER_01]: north.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're right in Buffalo and Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the geographic,
we are surrounded by Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are a glacial runner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off that all the minerals and everything
got deposited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our soil here, that's why we're such a
large farming community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our soil is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we were getting all that and
we're all grown pot in the fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fucking in the corn, you know,
we were growing some great fucking pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you got seeds in it, which you
would indefinitely get something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was happy as fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like piss off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got men's got season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fucking give me this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a score, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me smell the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, give me some descriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, see if I could grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it came from around here,
I knew I can grow it most likely grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors because there wasn't very many
people growing back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were, they were using phototrons
and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescent lightings and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the HID community really wasn't
taking off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the early nineties, I was having some
local kids go and steal fucking lights
[SPEAKER_01]: from in front of buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were street lights or
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were metal halides and HPS and they
were either four hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely all four hundred wasn't too
many thousand watts back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like two fifties and four hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we were, we were trying to,
um, we were growing pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we were fucking pot grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what we were growing,
how we were growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fuck man, it's, it's a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it weed for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you do to it, the more you can
fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it food, give it water, give it air.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to give, give you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, by, by bringing some of these
Jamaican making strains from New York and,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm saying Jamaican, which I think
it's going to be, it was, it was brick
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew most likely, I should say,
I didn't know back then, but I learned
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly that you can't grow indoors here,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, but we can grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, people didn't like it because it was
too big, too scraggly, too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if anything, they're growing up
here, especially all the pot that came
[SPEAKER_01]: from the, the sixties and the seventies or
sixties when the draft doctors were
[SPEAKER_01]: coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the seventies, when their kids
were getting, you know, old enough or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they were growing dad's
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just saw one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called Elmwood and it's supposed
to be this ancient genetic that is
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be fire for outdoor around
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a lot of, um, uh, seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know any more history on Elmwood or
is that just basically?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, all I know is I've wanted to see
forever because I heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I knew was like, when you get to
Northern London, North London,
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucan, Exeter, you know, a little bit
further North, maybe not as far as,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, not as far as Owens Sound,
but maybe kind of in that direction,
[SPEAKER_01]: South of Collingwood, Owens Sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, this was the plant that
everybody grew because it was massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, was it the, the,
the best?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know, but you know, we would have
people that grew like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This strain is called Berry Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Berry Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, uh, and it was my first centerfold
in high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what, what's in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a fucking seed that a guy came
in and says, this is the fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's, let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, had to be like an F1 because it
was all over the place, but it would
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking turn into something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, this is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we didn't have a fucking name for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They was like, guys tastes, smells like it
might be a blueberry size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm not calling it blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets the, uh, it gets the idea,
you know, like I was curious, when did you
[SPEAKER_03]: first start, uh, or when did you first
make contact with high times and start
[SPEAKER_03]: working with high times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Kyle found me, um, Gushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to put that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually sent him an email because he's
out and fucking the Oakster damn shit
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading the, uh, the, what does he call
it now?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant chiropractics or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super cropping, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an article that's was the first
article and it was like a growers
[SPEAKER_01]: interview or whatever on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did make it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shown by some growers in,
uh, in this area and I made sure it was in
[SPEAKER_01]: the article saying that, you know,
it's fucking phenomenal technique for
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are growing indoors that want
to grow certain strains, certain ways and
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to have fucking 50 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have two plants, three plants and
still get two pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not, it's going to take a little
bit longer, but you know, certain strains
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously work better for it, but it's
manipulating and training plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to grow in a, in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and so when Kyle came through,
so short, long story short, the other
[SPEAKER_01]: thing with him teaching this, I was like,
how'd you learn this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I want, I want, I don't want him to
acknowledge me, but I want him to
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledge the lineage of the history of
this technique because people deserve,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the recognition and it doesn't say
their fucking names, but especially
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't talk to either of them
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one guy is the biggest dick in
this fucking town when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in general, but he showed me this
technique that fucking got me recognized.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they flew me to the cannabis
cup to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just talk about Canadian
cultivation techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was super cropping.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they did the same thing with Soma
like five years later or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so anyways, um, Kyle was living in
Detroit at the time and, um, he was coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from maybe Toronto or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, he must've heard about,
uh, either the seeds or me or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear that beeping periodically?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my diabetic thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, uh, he just popped in the
shop one day at organics and struck up the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation and we hit it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, he would come back and I
would, uh, him and his boys, we called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Detroit Danksters, uh, great growers back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Sally is still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big John, I think is gone, but,
um, that was, that was his crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: his boys, super, super good, super
talented growers in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, but they liked the fucking
Canadian pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, they were coming through London
and I would invite them basic to a same
[SPEAKER_01]: before the hemp nation family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, listen, if you guys want,
you're paying 200 bucks an ounce,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're paying us not Canadian,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I was happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fucking stoke cause you know,
they're paying three, $400 an ounce in
[SPEAKER_01]: Detroit at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, you know, I'm selling to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do what the fuck you want with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have vac sealers back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just fucking, I was taking,
you know, freezer bags or taking Ziploc
[SPEAKER_01]: bags, throwing them in freezer bags and
then another freezer bag and then baking
[SPEAKER_01]: soda or dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another fucking Ziploc,
you know, and the way that we got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across was they would have a friend come
across, go to Windsor to the casino and
[SPEAKER_01]: boys would, like a guy would bring his
girlfriend, not tell her what was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would go over the night for the
casinos, the boys, the dancers were paying
[SPEAKER_01]: for all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are fucking, if, you know,
the, if they stay the night, do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the boys would go there with a
key to the, uh, to the guy's trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't even fucking hide it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just fucking a couple of bags in the
fucking back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then would drive across the board
with nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, uh, the next day they would,
the buddy would wake up, drive across,
[SPEAKER_01]: got all the paraphernalia from the fucking
casino, spent the night, had dinner,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't buy anything, didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, you know, fucking go through
no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that for fucking years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found out just a few years ago
that, uh, when they were, uh, went to
[SPEAKER_01]: cross to come by, come back here,
they were asked if they were coming to see
[SPEAKER_01]: me by name or, and they were just like,
okay, like, yeah, he's like around,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like the, the Windsor crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from Windsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now I had a, uh, a run in.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Windsor border, coming back from
a photo shoot, uh, four high times where I
[SPEAKER_01]: met with Kyle, um, and the gangsters and,
oh God, another photographer fucking most,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most famous, uh, photographer
back in the nineties to early two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there doing, he was shooting also,
but anyways, I was meeting with Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought all my photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right after I got back from
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had all my Swiss photos and my
Amsterdam photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I got, I got the early two
thousands then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you said I was in Switzerland in
2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Switzerland didn't really get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I was at the cup and I think
I did the cup and no, I did the cup quit
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so when I, that's what I was
meeting, I would imagine that's what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting Kyle for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I brought all my photos,
uh, which always meant pictures,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I just basically use as proofs and
then slides because that's what the
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then video because I wanted to,
uh, document the shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they pulled me and I was driving,
my girlfriend at the time had a 1969
[SPEAKER_01]: Volkswagen bus and I had crazy dreads that
were probably just about my shoulder
[SPEAKER_01]: length, but they were still just finishing
developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were all over the fucking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not crossing with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely would never cross with any
fucking pot or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, got pulled over and they said,
you know, we, we're searching the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I got a pot leap on my fucking
shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, do you have any drugs on
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, listen, this I tell you,
my name is Pete young.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from London, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own organic traveler, which is a
marijuana fucking paraphernalia shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't make it any easier than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, I'm not, I'm dumb, not stupid,
nothing illegal kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they said, okay, well,
we're going to search the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make you stand out, stand in front.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched the guy go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go around to the back and he's a younger
custom agent and he holds up the first
[SPEAKER_01]: slide and you just see his eyes go fucking
this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought he found the mother load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, ah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walk around and I approached him and
said, Hey, listen, you know, not sure how
[SPEAKER_01]: the law is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of have an idea that you're allowed
to look through anything, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people's likeness in these photos that I
do not have model releases for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So legally I can't show them to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he explained, yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have absolutely no fucking rights
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're allowed to look at every fucking
photo, every negative for pornographic
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, do you have any
pornographic material?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, it's all pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, it's me pot, my dog and pot
me, my dog and pot as like, there might be
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple titties models that are holding
cannabis and stuff like that, but nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: pornographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, okay, I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not hundreds, but thousands, if not maybe
10,000 photos negatives in that van.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I brought everything because that
was the money cow for me for high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, and I didn't get paid for all the
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it came into the grow America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Kyle needed photos to put into grow
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, okay, I'm going to donate this
many, but you're paying me for this man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I got to send a fold, I got 600
bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they got a full page, I got 300 bucks
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, uh, it made sense for me to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, maybe that's, you know,
he opened up another box and literally
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of photos and he's looking at
them and it's like pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, you want to see some
really nice ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start pulling out pictures from,
from, uh, Switzerland, which is fields of
[SPEAKER_01]: pot, not just like a backyard full,
but a fucking heck dares or yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, and he's like,
where's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, that's Switzerland,
somewhere in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, some are here, some are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never said they're from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never said they're from the States kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just opened up another box and he's
like, is it all pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like every single picture in here is
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, why do you have all this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily at the same weekend,
they were having the, one of their,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, big rave convention party kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what they called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a specific name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, Oh, I was coming back from
there and we set up a booth to show people
[SPEAKER_01]: to use cannabis because you don't have to
have it tested for fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bad drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had them at these, at these
concerts or at these parties where if you
[SPEAKER_01]: got a pill, they would go and they scratch
off a little bit of it and they would test
[SPEAKER_01]: it and say, yeah, it is MDMA or it's,
you know, some, it's some speed or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be able to tell you,
um, maybe not what's exactly in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they could more or less tell you
what's not in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just made up that bullshit literally
on the whim that I was coming from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had all the pictures that's just put
out on display to show the show kids not
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking do drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking gave them one of my fucking
credit cards said, Hey, listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: I offer, uh, 25% off any officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want them or you want to pipe a
bong, anything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just show them your badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get fucking, you get discounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was one of the techno festivals in
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, they were big back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I wasn't trying to interrupt or
anything like that, but one of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the ways that we used to regularly
go into, into Canada, um, that,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, was we used to go like in the,
especially in the Detroit scene with
[SPEAKER_04]: Windsor being right there, there was
parties that were thrown in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a lot of border crossings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they learned like what hippies and
Ravers looked like, and they didn't like
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we used to drive across the border.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're wearing like dockers and polo
shirts and all normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of our like real clothes were like
stuffed in the trunk of what we normally
[SPEAKER_04]: looked like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we were trying to go back and forth
and look like the biggest nerds ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you, you know, if you looked a
certain way, you're going to get,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to get checked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just didn't have that option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fucking dreads and you know,
like I did the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, I'm driving a Volkswagen
bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a pot leaf on my shirt and I got
fucking dreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm born in New York and I live in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a passport for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't deny me wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to the States, no matter what
I look like, they can't deny me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm only using my Canadian,
my U S passport.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to come back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not telling them that I have a
passport for the States or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I show them the fucking Canadian passport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't deny me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I look like somebody that you don't
want to let in your country, but I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: citizen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know you're in the States now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, uh, you know, it, um,
you know, I have, uh, I have, I have an
[SPEAKER_04]: uncle that does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has Brazilian citizenship.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he's, and he's, he's American as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he, he, when he goes into Brazil,
he uses a Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he comes back into the U S he uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like he never goes anywhere,
but he's constantly, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he just uses, you know, and so,
but yeah, I just, I just remember,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in the Windsor area,
cause Detroit was right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, as, as the years in the nineties went
on, they definitely started, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I don't know if you want to like
what, what, you know, profiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you will, you know, had an image of
like what hippies looked like,
[SPEAKER_04]: or what herbs, smugglers looked like,
or what Ravers looked like, or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what each week, one of these
groups was likely to have on them or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always, I always tell people that,
you know, I, I kind of followed a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: mathematical equation for lack of better
terms, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The police know that what to look for,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If, um, if you're in this, in this
industry, so there's going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, 90% of our community is susceptible to
getting busted because of the way they
[SPEAKER_01]: look, the way they smell, the way they
walk or talk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 5% on either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 5% of the people in this, in the
movement or industry that never leave
[SPEAKER_01]: their house, they don't go to the pro shop
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They send somebody to send somebody to go
buy the fertilizer, go buy their seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: go buy what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that person, whoever purchased
this has no idea what, who the person is
[SPEAKER_01]: that place the order kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That person is never going to get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, I mean, it's going to be very
unlikely that they get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other 5% is where I fall in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand on the street corner with a
fucking six foot pot leaf with my dreads
[SPEAKER_01]: out in my Volkswagen going, I'm a fucking
pot guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they know who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 90% of the other people are out
there are susceptible to fill their quota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the fuck do we want to drag in the
dreadlock?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to have the newspapers there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, we'll leave him alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm in that 5% on the opposite side,
because I literally had a six foot pot
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf in my front window.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally did have pot plants growing in
my front window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a certain time, my whole front
window was full of fucking peyote in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Pedro's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't you also do stuff like call the
newspaper and they would run an article
[SPEAKER_03]: where you take them to like a cornfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, that was a, that was a like CBC and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought news agencies to my field,
my crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me throw out a question before I lose
the threat of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you met Kyle, did he have a
strawberry cough then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever hear any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry, the cough came out of
Connecticut, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those boys, do you know who they are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who those guys are?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I know of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you know, this is another thing
with Hank, douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cough, they named it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Kyle fucking said, you know,
it makes them cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like strawberries, whatever the
fucking deal was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kyle was with HT at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he met the cough guys when,
when I was still hanging around with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never got to meet them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually, I had a warrant out for my
arrest in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't going to go to Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: No reason to be hanging out in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's no reason to go to fucking
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I didn't find it was a speeding
ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was 145 mile per hour speeding
ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never, I never went back and I was
like, you know, whatever, but he told me
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed like a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I had strawberry diesel and I was
like, what, what strawberry are they
[SPEAKER_01]: using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, is, is it, did you give
them my strawberry by chance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, what, what, you know,
and I never really got down that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I never went down that rabbit hole to
figure out what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I understand from what Kyle
told me, he's just like, they hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: money shot with a fucking, uh,
with a plant that produced this fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: fire pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what was in the strawberry
diesel you were running at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, just because it was,
that was, it was brought to me as the
[SPEAKER_04]: cough itself did start in Connecticut and
I got introduced to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made its way out to Colorado through
people who went from Connecticut to
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Kyle has always been a little bit
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, he dances around origin
stories because it's like one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that because he worked for high
times, he got pretty well known for,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as he's tried to become like a
cannabis celebrity, some of the origin
[SPEAKER_04]: stories of the things that he's known for,
he's gotten pretty, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty vague.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, cause the fucking douchebag,
he sold the cough to fucking Hank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why he's the strawberry cough seed
was produced is because fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know if the Connecticut boys
got even a piece of it, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because, and like when, when Kyle and
I, when I dissolved my friendship with him
[SPEAKER_01]: was we were in Amsterdam in the middle of
one of these squares, me fucking screaming
[SPEAKER_01]: at him about, uh, him backstabbing me kind
of thing over a common story.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, what the fuck is
wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, you know, he's a fucking skinny
little Jewish kid from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from New York, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and I was like, I, I know you did
it to the cough boys, but you didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just some fucking kids that you
fucking met that called you because they
[SPEAKER_01]: have some fucking great fucking pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got, um, Kyle got famous because of the
Kyle special blend fucking pitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hell's the name of the photographer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the names of the
photographers from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I will remember for, for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a super fucking nice guy,
super great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that pissed me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, he tried to, um,
he tried to put like, I was finished my
[SPEAKER_01]: first tour in, in Switzerland and I was
contemplating if I should go back or not
[SPEAKER_01]: because Steve is a hard person to fucking
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want reds from this town,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he, I didn't know him when he lived
here, but I met him through Steve before
[SPEAKER_01]: legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know who I met first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think, I don't know if I met,
I don't know who I met them all around the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all out in Vancouver,
um, red and Jare, he called himself Kermit
[SPEAKER_01]: for awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brokers, uh, growers, not, not breeding.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legends started in Switzerland,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it started with the, uh, the Louie
and, um, and that was just a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a freak, um, thing that happened with the
Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but so anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is Steve Steve's fucking wick is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking this fucking long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he, if you, if he's pissed off,
like when we were in Amsterdam and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, Oh God, my fucking have to start work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My memory is fucked now, but, um.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the fast spear story?
[SPEAKER_01]: No fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spear is my fucking story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took my metal because of my fast fast
fatty was a strain that Hank threatened to
[SPEAKER_01]: Sue us over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he went by, Hank came through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland saw heard that we were going
to enter all these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, I worked on these
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went back to fucking Amsterdam and
registered all the fucking names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we showed up, he at the dinner
right before, uh, high times is all the,
[SPEAKER_01]: with all the people, he came up to our
table and said, Hey, listen, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about entering these strains,
uh, I'm going to Sue you unless you get,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so red had to go up and make a side
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay, we're going to give you a
percentage, but the fucking douche bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: he wrote down fast fatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys hated fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking didn't want anything to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all big fucking Indica fit
freaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't fucking work in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, red did a little bit,
but I was there for fucking months.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, popper bear came out there,
sat in the fucking hammock smoke joints
[SPEAKER_01]: and fucking w you know, waited and thought
he was the fucking the king that we,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we bred sweet tooth, um, strawberry
blonde, um, the Louie, we just basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a, uh, we had 30, maybe 600 Watts
in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly we're just doing cuttings because
the company is called Mr. Hemp that Steve
[SPEAKER_01]: was working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it was right after they
got busted for the selling pot to a minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still had the, uh, we still have
the facility in Lugano and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: we ended up, uh, just taking a male and
smacking it against the fan in the corner
[SPEAKER_01]: that it pollinated the whole, like he
couldn't barely see through the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so some of my seeds here
someplace called the blonde bastard and
[SPEAKER_01]: the blonde bastard was, uh, was a
strawberry blonde crossed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they didn't want to do anything
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up, uh, keeping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the, uh, strawberry blonde?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what was in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is what I remember with Steve is
he, he had a whole bunch of strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: were, were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like, um, this here is, uh,
uh, big funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is one of his strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, the strawberry, uh,
sorry, the sweet tooth number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure again, Steve would be
better to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of this is, um,
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it might be just my
interpretation of it, but I believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: he had a bunch of strains that were,
uh, or he had, he had one strain or he had
[SPEAKER_01]: a few strains that he thought were fucking
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found that fucking resonance
blueberry male.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crossed everything with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it was my understanding is when he got
the, um, the, the sweet pink grapefruit
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting California, two cuttings came up
to Vancouver Vic, who I'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the guy's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure he was didn't get the best
reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one cut and Steve got one cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you talking about Vic high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I don't know who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, he's no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I have a feeling, um,
Steve took that blueberry male and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet and the, the, the sweet pink
grapefruit and crossed everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crossed them and then grew out a bunch
of those different seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one became sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: One became big, big treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: One became, you know, this one's called
big funk, but that's not his original
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big treat was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, something, but, um, I know I haven't
seen someplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know where the fuck they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, I have a feeling that Steve
ended up with, um, a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos of that, those two strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what he started building his
catalog off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the sweet tooth,
which was one of his more favorite,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he wanted to back cross it,
um, maybe to that same blueberry or to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of took different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had the, uh, he had two different
shishkeberries, uh, the red line,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and the yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, so I don't know,
you know, did that come from a dip?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that, you know, he was pretty famous
for growing these big, huge, long fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: spears of shishkeberry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a picture of his wife holding them
and they're like fucking three feet long
[SPEAKER_01]: of just straight colas kind of that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I think, you know, so I have a
feeling that maybe the, um, the seeds were
[SPEAKER_01]: all from the same, uh, same crosses,
but just different phenotypes that he
[SPEAKER_01]: started creating new lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think the sweet tooth and the
shishkeberry were the ones that really
[SPEAKER_01]: stood out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the strawberry blonde, the big tree,
the plum bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plum bud that I just saw that it was,
uh, yeah, that was, uh, and I know I have
[SPEAKER_01]: that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I have all these fucking seeds
someplace, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blind as shit though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see plum crossed a mighty Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was West coast seeds, but where's the
plum bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: It described it a little bit saying that
it smelled very fruity, but it didn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: into detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gabriella Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be able to see that collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you have some cool stuff in there
that I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, cause I keep track of everything,
but I just write it down and not think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super sober days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like this pungent skunk from
legends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even fucking think we even sold
that strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just one of the genetics that,
you know, we grew out that we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is from Khmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cal's Cal's are colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali's are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, um, C four is like a Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see four.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't produce worth a shit,
but it fucking was good train.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Cali or something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you can't, if I even bring up
that name with Papa bear, forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a fucking it's like with red and
Steve, you just can't mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brothers, like fucking back here,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve, like, did you know him before you
got invited to go to the Alps?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I knew him before then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first time I did opium, I was in his
fucking at one of his places, fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking out in his hot tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I didn't know how the fuck I met him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was a pot guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear he was from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He probably got out there through Hillary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he, how did you get the invitation
to go to Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve's a picky guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you had to have done something to
leave an impression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I remember you told me that fucking
guy paid me $2,100 a week to fucking go
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it dropped down to, and then
fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Steve, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get paid that much fucking pot in
Switzerland as a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, you know, Oh,
fucking the industry is not what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if I can, I'm, I brought
all the fucking, uh, pot to Amsterdam from
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland for the, for the cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what kind of, you know, I'm a little
bent by it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I always have been, but they were
all Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not wanting, they didn't want
anything to do with the fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, um, fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all fast beer because I was in the
field every day working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't smoke Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking, it would puddle me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would, uh, I was all about the
fucking night queen and the fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now these strains are all strains
from, uh, Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These street seeds came from, uh,
little Eddie douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one, Eddie, Eddie, which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like Dutchman?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nobody likes him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, so the deal was he was hired by
Mr. Hemp at the same time that Steve was,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he brought all these seeds that never
old him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story was never old him, owed him a
bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of paying him, he found a
fucking box of seeds in the back of a
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he had to jump ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gave them to Ed as payment,
partial payment, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those seeds ended up in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ended up in the field and we had,
that's where the Neville, that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, the night queen, the fast fatty,
fast beer or Neville's haze probably goes
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, I don't think we had
Neville's haze in our field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never heard of, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they were, they were, they were a
box that Neville sold to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant to talk to Neville about this
before he passed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like five years ago,
six years ago, I had another, a new
[SPEAKER_01]: contact, um, through the Mr. Hemp seed
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I never got a chance to talk to
him about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to ask him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was more about the history of this
box of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what year was the box of seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could tell you that they were still
viable in, in, um, 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99 probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the story was that, um, somebody
ordered these seeds, never picked them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got forgotten about in the back of
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when time came, for him to thaw out
the freezer for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: he passed them on to Ed for again,
what I was told for an outstanding debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Ed brought them to Switzerland
and Steve planted, him and Steve planted
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Ed had a falling out with Peter,
with, with, with Mr. Hemp and he was gone
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was brought in to replace him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, they actually even gave me his
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still had his phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got there, which I think is one of
the reasons why, cause it was still in his
[SPEAKER_01]: name and I was calling Canada and all over
the fucking, I was sitting in a field in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle of the Swiss Alps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't particularly care for the guy
anyways.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so that's what, that's what I
heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you, uh, did you have any old,
um, early Pearl, early girl, silver Pearl
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the, back in the early days of
Sensi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then see, this is the other thing
that again, you know, we hear so many
[SPEAKER_01]: stories and, you know, regardless of who
the stories are from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we went out to dinner with the drunkards a
few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, Sativa sisters, um, God,
Jesus, beautiful girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hell she's out of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, she's still in the business a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Amsterdam seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they were out of Canada though,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Karen was a blonde and then big tit
with the black gray hair that sold
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I forget her name.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's kind of still in the big tit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got big titties.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was, uh, Karen's partner in the
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's infamous out, out in the,
in the, in the, uh, uh, seed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you going to say about the Pearl
and the, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back, back then, um, when it wasn't the
Sensi seed bank, it was just the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be where Neville sold his
stuff to Sensi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have been Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I thought it was a partnership between
Neville and Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, uh, that was after seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was, that's what brought
the end of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was that's when Sensi seed
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, well, it wasn't the bus that,
that, uh, made Neville sell to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it drunkers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that basically the story
almost, basically the story was told that
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville was the breeder for a Sensi seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did breed for them for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but you know, it was all of his
genetics that he was breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when, when the first, um, catalogs were
coming out of the Sensi seed bank,
[SPEAKER_01]: you had early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had silver Pearl in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We loved it because again, we were dealing
with genetics that were, um, from Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these were, these were the original
fucking strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, other than like the skunk
and the Northern lights, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were, um, Ooh, I just had the name too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, fuck that's damn it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's who entered?
[SPEAKER_01]: The sweet tooth, um, before Steve was like
gray area or someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluebird, bluebird, bluebird cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, who owned that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know cats who bird cats who
bluebird?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who owned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was bluebird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, that's the one that Steve
tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to fire bomb because,
uh, we're talking about like Steve's
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking temper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was Ariane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and Luke and everybody else that
was trying to, and the drunkards are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to calm him down because they
entered, it wasn't bluebird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They entered the can, they entered sweet
tooth in the cannabis cup and without
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve's knowledge or permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was, it was a coffee shop
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, no, it was a C he, it was both.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a coffee shop, see, but they were
also a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barney's farm, Barney's farm, Barney's
because Barney made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barney's sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still sell sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was Barney.
[SPEAKER_01]: But see the, the, the, uh, that guy's like
fucking from what we were told again,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the other guys, big fucking,
um, Netherlands mafia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, you got to tell them,
Steve, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go there, you know, he's going to
kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fucking you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never seen him fight, but I wouldn't
want to see him fight because he would
[SPEAKER_01]: fight in a fucking heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, so, um, but yeah,
fighting, fighting the mob is not like,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was going to go in there and literally
firebomb the fucking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was like fucking Gary sucks kind
of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so anyways, um, so again, this is,
I, again, we're, you know, we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're like fucking the elders,
uh, sitting in the teepee, trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: regurgitate stories and we kind of go by
what we're, what we hear and what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: told kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us get to witness it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us hear it regurgitated once or
twice and we never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I like with, like I say,
with those seats from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, this fast spear, this night queen,
you know, this fast fatty, these,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was a whole bunch of other
fucking strangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, I was, I was told this
story and it, it, anybody that I reach out
[SPEAKER_01]: to and, and hear pieces from, they kind of
connect a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of sound similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about them being seeds from Neville and
stuff like that, for the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: most stuff was based on his.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that Neville mentions a
bunch is that it seems like 90% of what he
[SPEAKER_04]: made, he never released in the sense that
he had strains that he liked that got put
[SPEAKER_04]: on the catalogs, but he'd make hybrids of
all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And only a tiny percentage of those things
ever got offered up an actual sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't, um, we wouldn't, uh,
breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't breed anything without somebody
else's permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless it was a publicly, you know,
um, uh, available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can buy seats from like,
you know, I would breathe and not think
[SPEAKER_01]: about now with Luke, I wouldn't do that
because, you know, he's very particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and he's, he was small and same as,
uh, um, you know, so the small one,
[SPEAKER_01]: same as Soma, um, I wouldn't, uh,
I wouldn't breed any of his stuff unless I
[SPEAKER_01]: would, you know, I kind of asked him kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with this, like with all my
genetics, my, my, uh, B 93, I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to say, I can't sell that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people, I was offered a lot of money
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working out a deal right now to trade
somebody for it, but it's going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just because I want, uh,
Sam skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, I have an opportunity to get the,
one of the original skunk one cuts back
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were, and Sean, you, I think you
in town with that fucking that epileptic
[SPEAKER_01]: asshole kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just this kid that,
um, Brills was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was brought to me by the TCC,
the Toronto compassion center,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, said, listen, we have this kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's, uh, he's a good grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but he's mixed up with the wrong
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get him out of this town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you take them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Got him and his mom and his sister to
London, set them up in an apartment,
[SPEAKER_01]: set up a garden, the whole bit turned out
to be a great gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it went to his head and then shift
course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that, that, that original story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never finished.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's still dwelling in that
reality where he was always a go super big
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of guy and then getting in business
with really bad people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would always go very, very,
very bad West.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as soon as he left here, because it
happened over and over and over,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and like, he would always be
like, like when, when he would get fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: destroyed, he'd be like, I'm never growing
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never growing again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he's like buying or he's involved
in these like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giant farm chicken coops filled,
you know, like it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I, when I met him, we, he was because
of his and his mom, I loved his mom and
[SPEAKER_01]: his sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they had no control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would, uh, we would grow,
he would grow a bunch of pot for the
[SPEAKER_01]: center.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give them a receipt and then I
would give them a certain amount every
[SPEAKER_01]: week or every month, because if I gave all
the money to Billy, which I did in a few
[SPEAKER_01]: times, he went out and literally bought
$200 with the candy home and come to his
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I was like, where's the
money you were supposed to pay your hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, he's literally had bags of
fucking candy and his mom, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just that, but I remember the dude
would be like stretches, long stretches of
[SPEAKER_03]: time where all he would eat is like
lobster dipped in butter or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he was just that type of guy that was
like, it was always extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was after me because I didn't allow
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he started hanging out with a egg
boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got fucking busted in my truck with
480 plants or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get sucked into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad got sucked into it because it was
his truck, you know, and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they drop off a vehicle because
we switched vehicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out to be stolen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm driving around in a stolen fucking
Jeep Cherokee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like really fucking douchebags,
but that's skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the whole reason, the story he
had, we had him growing the black Domino
[SPEAKER_01]: and the skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this skunk one, I had, again,
it just landed in my lap through all these
[SPEAKER_01]: connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine it would have came from
the early Sensi days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was that fucking real skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a fine Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, is his name Scott?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine Dutchman is Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eddie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was a common name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was supposed to be one of the
original skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sellers of the seas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he had like some of the more pure
genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: His were called the pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw that here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an old Sensi skunk one pack in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have the old pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you have the pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have an old pack up here myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not as old as yours though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so missed out on some of the seed
packs showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I just lose you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hit a button on my fucking
keyboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Black, actually black Domino was out of
anything that I personally popped from
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam, as far as seeds that were
available to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the nicest thing I personally
found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember the description?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, it would leave a man
feeling whipped and something like the
[SPEAKER_01]: description that the boys put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full blooded Indica with large brax will
soon have you on your knees and begging
[SPEAKER_00]: for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harsh, overpowering lady simply gushes
sticky resin to which most men seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a fatal attraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: A word of warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This powerful compact Indica has had
devastating effect on many a man,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving them apparently beaten and whipped
with a strange smile on their faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so usually looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: After he gets done with the conversations
with me though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we when Ron was doing the
Canadian cannabis cups here in town and we
[SPEAKER_01]: had the red devil, I kind of stole that
kind of mantra from from that to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: the red devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making up a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fucking fire strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bunch of bullshit that I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I saw a red devil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was greenhouse that came out
with that, or at least they were the first
[SPEAKER_04]: people to sell public seeds of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red devil I ended up getting was from
an alcoholic guy that was a good grower
[SPEAKER_01]: from around here.
But.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Red devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in your catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani Afghan scope.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've always wondered if if like Shanti
doesn't still we've I've never known it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like if if you know, if he tries to
sell a version of that based on,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, because he sells devil,
but they've never explained what the fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I heard that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about the devil, but I don't know
if it's and again, the red devil was a
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting brought to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it we just had a fucking great phenol
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was friends with fucking crazy Ron
that hidden jungle, which was a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company and one of the original seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it was before iron iron seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but yeah, we entered the red devil in
his canvas cup at one first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I fixed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you keep much Willie Jack stuff
around?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he was one that was doing like a lot
of early girl and black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was from around here, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did his breeding in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was from Ontario, but he is breeding in
Montreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's Willie Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Willie Jack.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever see Willie Jack how he did
his fucking breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know nothing about Willie Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of questions about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally, I did a lot with the
Quebec seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I can't remember his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did a cannabis cup there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Willie would basically in his backyard
along his fence line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is what I was told.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would grow a male and a female and then
five feet, 10 feet apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another a different male and different
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you buy a seed and his seed was 30
bucks for mixed packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was saying, oh, this is Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has no fucking clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have some of that in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be honest with the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only charging $30 a fucking 10
pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to make shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, fucking tell people that this is
what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I breed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only charging you 30 bucks,
you know, but I didn't I didn't like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think I thought he was kind of
dishonest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if that's if that's how he's doing
his shit, it's obvious that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the cross pollination is going
to occur, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's what are some of the posters
behind you before I forget?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is a chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying before that the the one chemo
and now I think it's the fuck I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one of them went pink and I'm
pretty sure it was the Ottawa cut that
[SPEAKER_01]: went pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be the UBC one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, the Ottawa one is probably
just a UBC that was pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a spice of life strain tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who the fuck Eric is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is so let me just get the seed
pack back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mind sending you a bunch of
these seeds if you want to fucking try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and a me and a good friend will try
reproducing any pop.
Happily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: UBC chemo or a chemo poster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a fucking centerfold and I
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to pick this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this here is where's the camera?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this here is the Berry Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and it actually says it in the upper
corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to try to get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this here is the chemo and might be the
Ottawa because it's pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, this is what I've
been told, but it's super nice because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's super pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have tons of fucking photos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I told people for years like
chemo sounded cool, but like and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: always said they liked it, but the name
always turned me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, the theory that the history
was like the G 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that it came out of California and
it was used for medical patients that were
[SPEAKER_01]: chemo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe the cut came out to be out
of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have been called something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to UBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using it maybe for medical for
chemo patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it got its name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was just told that, yeah,
it got its name from the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this also this was another centerfold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to see because of the glare.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also Barry Barry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't really see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe better that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was like it was a go to strain for
me for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it was just it was so one
thing I'll say about this chat is because
[SPEAKER_04]: it we wildly bounce around.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like all kinds of things that I
think of that I want to chat about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then by the time that I want to be
merged on to some different year,
[SPEAKER_04]: totally different people, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing in that regard because we're
covering so much ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you said you're friends with red,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's with the fast spear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in with his no shirt on this
fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He showed up to the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see if I can find a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take a picture of that later and
send it to me?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was Matt, there was this we I
used to go to these harvest festivals in
[SPEAKER_04]: the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was this guy, Matt knows who he
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was this guy, Chip, that started
Royal Gold, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had just been out to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was an O one maybe or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I remember the first time I saw
pictures like you were mentioning of those
[SPEAKER_04]: fields and hectares and huge greenhouses
and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came back with all these photos on his
computer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of all these people in Switzerland that
were just starting to blow it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time, it was the largest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they would do it under
aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had this is one of this is a field
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was for aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of that's harvesting some of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember way back then when you were out
there, somebody showed me a picture
[SPEAKER_03]: because you weren't around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was you sitting in an armchair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I had a flower up to your knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've seen in the frame was like
flower up to your knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the young people watching now that
are like in their in their 20s,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at this and they're.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had terracotta floors and we didn't
have enough place to hang it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the funniest thing is on the on the
table there, there's only two sets of
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what we we had to harvest
all the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went through the field, harvested
all the tops, brought them back and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, we can't even hang them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just laid them all terracotta and we
just went in and rotated them every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's me sitting in the chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for people like Matt was saying,
for people that are younger, I think
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland, for the most part,
was the first time that it was like us
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing like non land race type pictures
of, you know, people actually growing on
[SPEAKER_04]: that large of a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you see the grows so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people used to seeing big CBD grows
here is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people our age are used to seeing
these massive hemp grows and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people during that era, you would
never fucking see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really it was a really unique
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very special time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that era, like people in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing stuff like this was mind blowing at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a company in town called Novak's
and you're supposed to take your bag into
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts of the world and enter it
in a contest.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I basically got the most votes,
but they can't they because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got back in the boot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a do you know, Felix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is his field in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had such shooting plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His like his this is his his what his
field look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, have any of his stuff saved?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to supply so impossible to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so impossible to get in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: because he just never shipped here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is like and none of the
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so this is a sweet tooth garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we we sorry for the fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've seen that picture before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that I got some of this on your
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you got a bunch of pictures on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that one is there's there's a few
of the Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the skunk one on this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to and the other side is our
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a black story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dark picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has the black domino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before you offload that, let us know
so we can make sure that thing stays alive
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, I have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sending it right now to the guy for
the skunk one cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm giving him the the the B 98,
the widow 95 and the B 93 would be nice
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was our northern light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was my version of Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the size, that's a four
inch cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just like when you see the
the size of the nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I picture looking like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it was the best sea of green
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was and it was an owl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, was it a pure owl?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks a lot like what I would
picture the NL five cut looking like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was just, you know,
yeah, it was just a phenomenal cut kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another one of red fucking
boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's funny, dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would we had such this is in
Switzerland, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had such a fucking good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet that's when everybody loved
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he when that guy first showed up
to fucking Switzerland, fucking guy sees
[SPEAKER_01]: the field, he gets all excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes home and he shaves from his like
shoulder down to his wrist, back of his
[SPEAKER_01]: hands, shaved his entire arm, both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: He doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, dude, I'm running through the
field with my arms out and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted finger rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made it like fucking 10 feet,
20 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lost his breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't get a fucking quarter of a
fucking gram off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But his arm was shaved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you got to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: He literally did shave his fucking arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think you got a single fucking
gram of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ash kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made it about two hours in right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's so much more we can cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we could do a part two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was hoping actually that we could
have you back and we could we could see if
[SPEAKER_03]: we could get Kip back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or or maybe even Chris Clay also as an
option, because I know that we like I
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned before, there was about I don't
even know how many questions or how many
[SPEAKER_04]: follow ups I could think of while you were
talking about stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then we just tangent it off onto
something totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't have to apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have ADHD, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you read my book, like I can eat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can send you a copy if you need or I
need a signed copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a stream of consciousness,
which I liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, it was my book is written
that way because I wrote it as if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: having a conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to hire somebody to listen to
me, take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then try to put it in fucking order
chronologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in perfect order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at it going because I
smoked a lot of pop back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like that hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember it happening this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another story that crosses with
it doesn't line up perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, fuck, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did make a huge mistake in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't my mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a misprint, which says that I grew
a cannabis cup winning strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fast beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was my fucking not my strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I was the one that chose to enter it
in the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys didn't want anything to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I knew it was going to win because
the it was honor of the goddess,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was all the female judges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got hired by sativa sisters,
Karen.
[SPEAKER_01]: She flew me to Amsterdam just to be a
fucking gigolo.
[SPEAKER_01]: A guy slut because I fucking have a good
time and I like fucking females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when boy and I got laid a lot,
it's why that's why we relate so well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now we're now we're now speaking
Sean's language.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just smiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fucking it's because of that,
you know, all the growers out there now
[SPEAKER_03]: know that you can get laid and be a
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to cut off in two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sagamoth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still he brought this beautiful,
hot fucking yoga girl from Texas to work
[SPEAKER_01]: his booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was all stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's going to get some that
chick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took her home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took her back to my hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, I don't want to leave
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I got no place to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never made made my return flights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's like, oh, you can just stay with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what are you saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, oh, one of Tony's places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, do you think this guy who
flew you there paid for all your shit is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be OK with me coming to fuck you
in his place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony, Tony, you know, Tony's a rock star.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony's a fucking well, I'm the coolest,
cutest fucking Sebastian Bach wannabe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had like long hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very beautiful mane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I was like, and here comes
this fucking, you know, ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York dread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had fucking you saw the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pitchers, my dreads were not fucking
anything to write home about at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sleeping in a field for the last
fucking two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I was eating off of a dirt
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, and I was fucking
the hottest chicks kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a simple farm hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I do when I do talk, I I got down
different veins.
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, no, I wasn't I wasn't criticizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just simply saying that,
like, as you talk about a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: different stuff, there's like different
things I wanted to go off on and something
[SPEAKER_04]: totally else interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to take you got to take notes as
we're talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kept recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I want to talk about,
because I'm the same way.
