[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_03]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_03]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_03]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to take a quick moment
before we enter into this awesome,
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome episode with more members from the
Kana Command.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know our Blue Revolution is
in stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blueberry Incross that we've been
working on for five years now has finally
[SPEAKER_03]: added what I feel is a great completion
point for it, a true breeding line for
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry scents and flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was our most popular selling line on
the original release when we released the
[SPEAKER_03]: first Bluebonnet crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't make a whole lot of them because
I really wanted to explore what was in
[SPEAKER_03]: them before I did a major release.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were at that point, and it was
originally a DJ Short Blueberry from DJ
[SPEAKER_03]: Short's early, early work where he would
sell the seeds at different talks that he
[SPEAKER_03]: would do across California at collectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buddy Resenlung picked up some packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave them to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went through them and found the best
representative of what I thought the most
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful blueberry was like, but it
didn't have the exact scent that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I saw that in my mind's eye,
as I would look at it, I would picture
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful blueberry jam, turps,
and flavor, and scent, just all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made a mission the last five years to
make this a reality and something where
[SPEAKER_03]: you could pop a pack of seeds and it would
be almost identical for that turf profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are now released on RiotSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pre-order is over.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already shipping out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have something called the Modern
Blue that we didn't really release.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it on our Patreon, so definitely
check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our 50 tier Patreon ended up getting the
lion's share of these with their monthly
[SPEAKER_03]: package.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Mac Daddy across to Blueberry
Incross Mac Daddy from a company called
[SPEAKER_03]: Outhouse Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then my personal favorite out of the hype
strains, as it were, that we are merging
[SPEAKER_03]: with some of this blue stuff so that we
can bring it into the modern generation
[SPEAKER_03]: and get some of the new kids interested,
the Sherb Cream Pie, phenomenally
[SPEAKER_03]: resinous, great hash maker, great
yielding, nice long high for a sherb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberry Incross, which is my biggest
problem with sherb, crossed to our
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberry Incross, and we called that one
Blue Cocky, and yeah, triple entendre
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Blue Sphemi, because it's blast
for me to use something like Runts for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the white Runts, out of all the Runts
stuff I found to be the best Runts cross
[SPEAKER_03]: with the most potent high.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a Blueberry Incross cross to that,
bringing heavy, heavy Blueberry Jam turps
[SPEAKER_03]: to the white Runts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have Trotberry, which is the
Dossetrop, Tropic Cherry, I believe,
[SPEAKER_03]: crossed to the Dossy Dose, crossed to the
Blueberry Incross.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these are currently available on
our site.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're sold out, they're sold out,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to make sure you're all aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without any further ado, let's get into
our show and welcome Curbside and some of
[SPEAKER_03]: his homies from the Cabane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what else have we got going on with
the Cabane?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other future plans you could think of?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do lots of stuff with the
Cabane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do these Breeder Boxes,
where I'm going to call you up one day and
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, hey, Matt, I need you to donate a
bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: This amount of packs, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get a bunch of people to
donate seeds, and I'm going to try and put
[SPEAKER_01]: together some packs that are like 10 packs
or 20 packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're giving them supply that we can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then sell them for like 50 bucks,
100 bucks to members of the Cabane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, good genetics are getting out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at an affordable price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know these days, I see a lot of people
that don't want to spend money on
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That upsets me because I come from a place
where you pay to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: You support your homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy things, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't want to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when they do, there's so many options
that a thousand dollar pack of beans,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 10 years ago, a lot of people,
there were a lot of us that were
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in buying that these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't happening, Captain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a clone culture now, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of FOMO of people thinking
that they're going to go chase that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an elite, though, but they don't
realize that elite was selected from two
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in some dude's closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one person opinion and there's a
lot of hype as opposed to a bunch of real
[SPEAKER_03]: smokers saying, I agree, you agree,
we all agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some fucking game.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big difference now in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's artificial hype versus a bunch of
people agreeing that this was actually an
elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take much to be proven and
elite these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of good weed out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not hating on the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some good weed out there,
but man, weed's not hitting like it used
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all cookies based, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit has a 10 minute, 13 minute high
and it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what you call it, cookie,
sherb, lotto, it all ends in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all dead end breeding directions
unless you outcross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of these people are crossing inwards
and inbreeding cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't done anything super beneficial
for the breeding pool out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these exotics, super finicky.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that they call this shit exotics
blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we used to think exotics,
it would be like Nepalese or some wild
[SPEAKER_03]: Thai land racer or some Mexican you hadn't
heard of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exotics now means fucking normal shit you
could buy from any Tom, Dick, Stanley on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram pushing some purple frosty shit
related to cookies, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a trendy word that's being
picked around to hype up certain strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think out of everything that came from
the cookies generation, from all that,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously Skittles was an outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Skittles won the annual
contest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it won that cup, I remember everybody
was like, oh, we're going to just cross it
[SPEAKER_02]: to gelato, cookies or whatever to make it
pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this stuff is just some percentage of
gelato, some percentage of Skittles,
[SPEAKER_02]: some percentage of the old cookie cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Runts is basically just gelato,
S1 or whatever bag speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of all that, what are the keepers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gelato 33, 41 will probably always have a
place on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these poly hybrids of it, they're not
really bringing anything that new or
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are a little fruitier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are a little gassier,
but it's just in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, I've been out with
homies in Cali and we go and we smoke a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of joints and the old 33 cuts still
cuts through everything else and flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is just watered down
versions of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now people want the original Skittles all
of a sudden again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went back to where we were seven years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't keep the clone of that piece of
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people just recently paying
like 400 bucks an ounce for an ounce of
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just goes to show that right now,
Terps are king because no grower is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be like, oh man, I want to grow
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if they've grown real Skittles,
then they know they don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing I think new that
came out of a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The motor breath got crossed out to a
bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, anybody that's doing anything
interesting and breeding has been digging
[SPEAKER_02]: back into other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Land races have been everyone's thing and
claiming land race crosses when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not really that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could take any bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it on the ground at a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be a land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this in Thailand from fucking Cookie
Fam and it's in their bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a Thailand race.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think we need to evolve from where we
are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just anecdotally, about a year ago in
March of last year, I got to go to Morocco
[SPEAKER_02]: and I toured a bunch of hash farms there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a super dope experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even there, as soon as I got there,
I got these Moroccan guys that are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have the roots?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, of course, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing model lines in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA started doing all the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell you the whole DNA story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the inside scoop on what they did
there when I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just say first, in the last five
years, the American genetics have really
[SPEAKER_02]: blown up there everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain, Europe, if people want to grow all
the American cusps now, the Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't spin over.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened in Morocco, nobody's grown
land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone started getting all these new
problems, like cesium, hop slatin,
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew, because the strains
they've been growing for the last 1,000
[SPEAKER_02]: years are acclimated to their soil,
to their climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're having, they're like,
I don't know why I'm getting this stem
[SPEAKER_02]: rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting all this cesium,
losing whole plants that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: multi-pound plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand with DNA,
what happened there was through Crockett
[SPEAKER_02]: and those guys from the Tangy really blew
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went there and a lot of Moroccan
farmers are pretty rudimentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to those orange citrus turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really represents really well there
and cuts through in the hatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody just went crazy for Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangy turps down there and bombed Europe
with Tangy hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farmers are really successful from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in subsequent years, DNA went back
there and tried to sell Tangy F2s or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the follow-up lines are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't find that same percentage of
that Tangy orange vino in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the hash they were producing was
bunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have dirt-poor Moroccan farmers in the
mountains that couldn't sell their hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: that couldn't feed their kids,
end up committing suicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: People wanted to rip their heads off
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they just went there and sold
millions of seeds just profiteering and
[SPEAKER_02]: just didn't give a fuck about the farmers
or the people at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just spraying the land races that were
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which unfortunately, unless you go
really deep in the mountains, nobody's
[SPEAKER_02]: really grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the young guys there that I saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you'd have to be so lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw gushers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw all the breeders that we've been
talking about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how disappointed I would be if I
pulled up to Morocco and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at my field of gushers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was disappointing for me because when I
was 14, I got to spend the summer in
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was smoking hash there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all Moroccan hash and it all had
that church-incent, really ethnic kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: unique flavor that is rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: This turf profile that just doesn't really
exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything now is just the same version
of all the cookies, gelato, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles stuff we're just talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they're going citrus because you can't
really lose with citrus turps in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all that they're producing
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all like Italian and French mafia
guys controlling it down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Moroccan farmers are just like dirt
poor trying to get their hands on seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crazy scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this conversation with a lot of the
kids that have been maybe coming in the
[SPEAKER_03]: last 10 years and wanting to really get
into land races and trying to explain to
[SPEAKER_03]: them, dude, like you're going to have a
really hard time not only because they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't necessarily know what the land races
would look like as much as I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: because I've never been over there,
but I do know who has been over there and
[SPEAKER_03]: how often they sell seeds and the amount
of seeds that they sell over there each
[SPEAKER_03]: year in Morocco and how those get
distributed to Afghanistan and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And trying to explain to them,
you're a little bit late to the party to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to discern what's over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just absolutely hate hearing
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, no, really, this is what's
happened over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unfortunate, but we all miss the
boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really have to get tied in with the
right people to find something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really been preserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have asked me, I got some
buddies in Greece that have been able to
[SPEAKER_02]: link with like an old legendary grower in
the mountains there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been able to collect five land
race Greek genetics, including the famous
[SPEAKER_02]: Kalamata Red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've had it genetically tested with
like the whole phylos or whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal genomics galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust medicinal genomics over phylos for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's the same company now.
[SPEAKER_02]: One became the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically it's a genetic outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've asked me, what should we do
with the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to out-cross it to cookies
and all these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, the first thing you do if
you get a hold of seeds from somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's not legal yet that you know
where land race is like, just do a huge F2
[SPEAKER_02]: preservation lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Open pollinate, make like thousands more
of those seeds and give them out to people
[SPEAKER_02]: so that shit's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're trying to protect it and
not let it completely get out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you still got to give it to some homies
and trust it because so many things have
[SPEAKER_02]: been lost over the years because it's
still illegal in most of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if the Real Seed Co,
I know they sell a Kalamata Red from
[SPEAKER_03]: Greece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that's sourced from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I have some here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're expensive as fuck even on the
Real Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to get old heirloom Greek seeds would
be really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I rolled the dice, but I haven't popped
them because I just don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand about it is it
actually has a really awesome unique turf
[SPEAKER_02]: profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has really nice colors that express
from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just old school spear shaped
fluffy buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the flower density that the
market wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why people wanted to out-cross it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've crossed this to cookies,
the first thing that just bastardizes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A dead end breeding pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs something like old sensei hash
plant or old Afghani one or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: To bring some of that and keep the
diversity without bastardizing it with a
[SPEAKER_03]: poly-hybrid fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to really dominate the
turf profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to let that turf profile
express itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the problem with a lot of these
land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they were bred for just outdoor
growing, we bring them inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have longer flower times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these commercial facilities chop
it eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just the weed that we have now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it's going to herm, like bringing
outdoor to in usually has herm issues at
[SPEAKER_03]: the jump.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to acclimate it, select,
do all this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people don't want to put in
the time because it's got to be bang,
[SPEAKER_03]: bang, bang.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something new each month.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a new drop each month of 100
strains to keep your whole shit going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a different scene, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The art of breeding has really kind of
been lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and CSI talk about it a lot when
releasing new lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we put these out to be tested,
if we take the time to test these seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: now, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because other people are going to be
releasing six different drops and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to see we're releasing this and
working on it and just say they have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Release it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then while we're over here testing it
and doing the real work, it's already been
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea of it's been out there and done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now what we've done, even though it's
real, is no longer relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real bad kind of black hole getting
worse and worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed companies have really painted
themselves into a corner with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No testing shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the biggest
downfalls to seeds these days is there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of greed in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rush to the market, the rush to be
first, the rush to beat everybody as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to taking the time to do something
properly and right is painfully apparent
[SPEAKER_01]: with the offerings that are available out
on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: These days, but there's a few people I'm
interested to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know who is everybody's favorite
breeders are these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's go around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you at?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to say bloom right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've had real good luck with the
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we just ran the candy fumes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another phenome of black maple
that we really like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, yeah, he'd probably be my
favorite right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say Bloomco probably too,
because he's kind of a homie and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: grown a lot of his stuff over the last
several years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's hard to say because nothing has
been too impressive to me lately,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've had to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I deal with a lot of commercial
facilities, so I'm not in a super heady
[SPEAKER_02]: world right now, unfortunately,
but nothing really punches through for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm Bloomco, I guess,
by default right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to stack all you motherfuckers
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Kurt, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, Bloomco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Bloomco.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does amazing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, boom, Bloomco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds that I've bought personally lately,
I just got some stuff from people under
[SPEAKER_01]: the stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like everything that he's doing
with his sour stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He preserved a lot of old school res dog
shit that was fire and like a sour
[SPEAKER_01]: Saunders and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's another dude, boom, on the
cabana, like, get him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The relentless stuff, all the rotten stuff
and pretty much everything that I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't have any relentless gear,
but everything that I've seen from him is
[SPEAKER_01]: super fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got a bunch of stuff from Shahbud
after literally after your reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: After your podcast with him, I was trying
to get some cat piss seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even hit you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, man, I'm on his site.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not letting me order.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ordered them and then he intercepted
my order before it came out to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: super hooked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10 packs turned into 100 packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shah's amazing, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to do a big cat piss project
because he sent me a bunch of cat piss
[SPEAKER_01]: beans and cat piss is personal favorite of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the NorCal and the SoCal cat pisses
and every other piss variety that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: come across is not what I've been looking
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't the NorCal one that was like a
squatty indica, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that wasn't the one,
you know, I know what Curb's talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about, that like 2000, like straight,
like litter box in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost had a little sweetness to it
also.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say the SoCal cat piss came from
Paradise Seeds Mod, TK1.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a huge scammer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really interested to see how his
fake San Diego cat piss turns out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would save yourself the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already grown some San Diego cat piss
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really, after hearing Shah talk
about the cat piss, he actually had me
[SPEAKER_01]: hyped like, oh man, he might've been
smoking what I want, what I want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I truly hope it is, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I'm going to try do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been getting the, like when I do
a seed hunt, I buy beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the beans from everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so if I'm doing a sour diesel hunt,
I get sour diesel from everywhere that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can get sour diesel from and see what's
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a bunch of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some sour diesel from CSI,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspector sent some, so I didn't even.
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked me what I wanted, and I was like,
bro, you got too much stuff, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, geez, Ken Sowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And send me a bunch of TK stuff,
a bunch of chem stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, he does cool things that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he'll do a Chem D times Chem 91,
and then he'll do Chem 91 times Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: He reverses the reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's the same genetics,
the pollen is going to take differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants reverse differently and genetics
align differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love being able to grow things side
by side like that and see exactly what's
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he and he sent me some big bad wolf and
some big bad wolf, too, which is just just
[SPEAKER_01]: like the reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got some old Chem D Chem 91
from Canorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I want to pop all of that
together so I can see, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's what, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like inspecting a lot, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who I think are doing just like
really good things for seeds and culture
[SPEAKER_01]: in general are like the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like his podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Fletch is a man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and him, but head sometimes,
but I love Fletch, like from a real
[SPEAKER_03]: honest, like breeding perspective and how
passionate he is about collecting and
[SPEAKER_03]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a lot of love for that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we've had our issues as well,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hit him up and I was like,
look, man, you're a huge part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're OG on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to have you on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anything, any differences that we may
or may not have, let's just put them
[SPEAKER_01]: aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he hits me back and he's like,
yeah, we don't really have that many
[SPEAKER_01]: differences, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one one little thing,
one little issue that like spawned out and
[SPEAKER_01]: what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and we see we've seen each other,
you know, a hundred times over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always all all love and at events and
everything, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the good thing about the old school
events is you really got to know people,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, because there was kind of like a
circuit of people like we were all doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the events.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all had the booze.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all like, you know, we're going out to
eat afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything and I've missed those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to have some cabana events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I missed last weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to be at Canna Con in
Oklahoma with Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I flaked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I flaked on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to do some events at the
Hork at the Hork grow boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going to share some booze and
be around, always working together and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a curb there with me to clown on
all the new no name breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we do our can Illuminati events,
dude, I'll have you guys all invited out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's far.
[SPEAKER_03]: California's far.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys are all welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be careful who you even hate on
these days, man, because I'm a hater by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just naturally go to hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of these guys are putting
in work just because I'm old and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the same way, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just clowning over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I mean, I feel like even in
the old, old days, like we always had a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder or somebody that was like the butt
of the joke, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like back in the day, me and Red Dog were
at each other's throats all the time for
[SPEAKER_02]: like a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, or like it was cool to make fun
of Subcool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was easy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but, you know, every I mean,
even a broken clock is right twice a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and sometimes you got to give the
plants credit and what they're capable of
[SPEAKER_02]: over the humans that just interacted with
them because the plants has this amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to, you know, produce these terp
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like sometimes a breeder that's just
even fumbling around will stumble across
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you're going to,
you know, adhere it to their ego and make
[SPEAKER_02]: it about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like the plant has that ability
sometimes to like just you find a diamond
[SPEAKER_02]: in the rough and that's nothing against
any of the new breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, you can get really
lucky when you're working with good parent
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the example I've always
given is like if both your parents are
[SPEAKER_02]: professional tennis player, you're
probably going to be pretty good at
[SPEAKER_02]: tennis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we had we had to work with just
like, you know, in the early days,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we were just working with Dutch
genetics and whatever like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican bag seed we could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had to dig hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more work to find something like
truly noteworthy and memorable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, now it's like there's so
much out there between other people's
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, quote only genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can just grab something and start
crossing and playing around and stumble
[SPEAKER_02]: across something maybe not unique,
but but definitely fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, definitely a big shot at finding
HPLV if you're playing with fucking clones
[SPEAKER_03]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the availability of everything too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like back in the day, there was three or
four seed websites that were actually like
[SPEAKER_01]: legit that I trusted that I would order
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a new one every week,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's got a horror story from,
you know, a dealing that they've had with
[SPEAKER_01]: a seed vendor and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just become such a a shitty
business, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to I want the seed vendors to
know that I'm trying to I want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusive stuff at the Cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hook the community up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give good prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give the vendors good prices,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not I'll I'll work with you on vendor
pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make it worthwhile for everybody
to stock their gear at the Cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get ready for the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want people to be hyped to be
able to find rare stuff and new stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, all of these seed sites,
man, they got the same stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be in stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be out of stock, but it's all
the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to have different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise that if you're on the Cabana,
you will find different clones that you
[SPEAKER_01]: won't find anywhere that you might
actually someone might actually share them
[SPEAKER_01]: with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know our guys will all be a part of
it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our whole crew high and lonesome.
All of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to I'm I'm going to get I
got tons of seeds that I've made over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give seeds away to everybody
who you complete a grow log.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, I'll send you a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can refer some people, you want to
get three people referred and they make
[SPEAKER_01]: their little intro and say so and so
referred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you a pack of seeds for all the
referrals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I really want people to get up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start posting your process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, tell me what nutrients you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post the hits of, you know, let's get
these grow logs going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to bring the forms back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got we all do that needs community
involvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more the communities involved,
the more the breeders and the people
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the scenes, I can get them involved
and bring some people out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of people who
support the cabana that aren't on there
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like Bodie, he loves the cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a lot of busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not really on a lot of social media
these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've already talked to him like,
you know, he's down for he's down with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's we just got a lot of old school guys,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, breakfast with Katsu the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing some cool new projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's out in Oklahoma with me now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just quickly speaking to T.G.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people are going to fucking shit
their pants when they find out who owns T
[SPEAKER_03]: .G.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: and what's coming out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a resurgence of T.G.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out soon and it ain't no sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave a little drop a little dime there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little sneaky hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also old school to where if I don't
like you, I don't care if you got the best
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to buy your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone snitched on friends,
if someone's done anything like that
[SPEAKER_03]: snitch, I will not support them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I truly believe bad juju passes on,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sure I don't want good money going
to bad people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough good people in the industry
doing good work to not have to fuck with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you talk about breeders,
like without including myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I don't sound like an egotistical
bastard.
[SPEAKER_03]: CSI to me is heads and tails above doing
it better than me, doing it better than
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: High and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't know if you guys remember
high and lonesome from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poodle nuts, Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that Poodle nuts cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rocked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually some of the best weed I ever
had was Kenarata just handed me some Percy
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds he made that were like a fire OG BX
to the Poodle nuts cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like straight that dog waltz
terps, but with hard, nice OG golf balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was the problem with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poodle nuts cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grew like a, almost like a deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a bush fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With this little nugget in the middle of
all these leaves, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was like some of the most fire
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, like I wish I still,
I would have kept my mom at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that was still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got it back in the circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to cross that to an OG and find
that, you know, that like that with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Poodle nuts terps, but with the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: High end lonesome is one of my other
favorite breeders and not just because of
[SPEAKER_03]: his breeding, but like as a human,
he's made me be a better human.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we become friends, like he has a moral
code that like really is almost second to
[SPEAKER_03]: none as far as like how you treat people,
how you treat your customers, how you hold
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself as a man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the kinds of people I like
meeting, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: In our first Kana Kavana episode,
getting to speak to Howie and D-Man and
[SPEAKER_03]: Skitty, like I was intimidated by Optimus
Prime, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was kind of scared to talk to that
dude and getting to talk to him
[SPEAKER_03]: one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is one of the coolest motherfuckers
there are, you know, same with D-Man,
[SPEAKER_03]: like all those dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a great, it was great for a
lot of us that even been around for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time that have never really had a lot of
dealings with them because I was always
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of intimidated to really break that
ice, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some really, really cool
down to earth old school dudes that made a
[SPEAKER_03]: change in our scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, and I didn't get a really touch on it
too much, but like what Howie did with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Kavana and not even as much with the
Kavana, but what he did with the community
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Kavana, like it really was,
it was like, it was an honor and it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it felt cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were young, man, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, you know, to meet the old timers
and some of the people that we met over
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, Scoosh, NCGA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love NCGA.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's my, he gave me my first booth at
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the first old school dude that was
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everybody hates your ass,
but I'm going to bring you to my booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think Matt, that was the first
time I met you was when you had that
[SPEAKER_02]: booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alaska, Alaska Elliott was over there and
he was like, you know, introduced me to
[SPEAKER_02]: NCGA and I thought he had a booth chair
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, like 2015 Emerald Cup,
2014.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good year for the Emerald Cup,
but I think, I think you actually may have
[SPEAKER_03]: two people in a four foot space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like NCGA, if you know him,
he's like 10% Ron.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what he had told me is like,
yeah, just give me 10% of yourselves and
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll share a booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get back there and there are six
other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's sharing this four by four booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just basically set up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had clones behind me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody thought I was selling clones
of my gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I'm just the seed guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want your fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us some of those clones back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love Ron though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me a shot and take a chance on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the best parts about Howie
and Skitty is cause it gave us the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the automatic intro to like the old timers
and outside of Howie bro, like if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: an old timer, you didn't really fuck with
the younger generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no reason for you to,
you weren't trying to deal with any kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Howie always, man, man, here's,
here's my mom room, take whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go over there anytime,
you know, I had a project going on or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I needed new moms or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go over to Howie's and see what he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I knew he was going to have
something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was nice to, it was,
it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't realize how spoiled you are
until you know the struggles that like
[SPEAKER_01]: other people go through and you're like,
Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never had to deal with that shit too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like being in SoCal with the hogs breath
through, I was fed shit early on,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the pure cush when it came.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out fire OG, all that shit is clones,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What a drop, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Kent, one of the first people with Kim
D in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on you realize how many
people just didn't have it and how early
[SPEAKER_01]: you had it and how many people wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like how, like you just, you don't
appreciate things because, and I'm guilty
[SPEAKER_01]: of this cause I've had so many dope things
that I wish, damn, I wish I had this back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just thinking back on like just old
school cuts from like our little crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Southern charm from still too big,
like great cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to the abusive OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposedly some people are floating that
one around again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm skeptical when I hear that people got
abusive OG again, but I'd like to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it is shorelines back around though,
the old shoreline cuts back around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mean the chems, I think always
kind of stayed around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, that was, that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chem stay around, but we all rocked
chem four pretty, pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I ran nothing but chem four for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys ever get to run?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never ran chem one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw, uh, uh, inspect is doing some work
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did some, I'd be interested to see
what that's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it, what's the closest comparison
to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Super silver fucking Hayes bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an NL five Hayes dominant cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when we were able to realize,
okay, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we know chem four, wasn't just a bag
seeded the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is obviously an NL five Hayes cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's almost all mercy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's very obvious and had a lot
of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little teeling and turpentine
lean in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's got all the traits to NL five
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very strong, very strong breeds true
breeds true for 5% plus turpines though,
[SPEAKER_03]: for, uh, mercy, which is special in its
own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, and it's like only somebody like
inspector could come up with chem one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was a point where I probably
had 80 moms in my, uh, in my basement,
[SPEAKER_01]: my little condo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember, uh, my neighbors called
and snitched me out and I ended up getting
[SPEAKER_01]: raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, of course I called like all the
cabana guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, man, everybody come to my
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to break everything down right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cops gave me 48 hours before they came
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so I remember everybody was over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, it was a free for all,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a free for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was one of those things
where I had caregiver cards from patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cops showed up and they were just so
confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, is it illegal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they didn't want to mess with them,
but they knew, uh, they ended up getting
[SPEAKER_01]: me on building violations because I didn't
hold permits to do like my electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: upgrades and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of you guys ever come across free for
all the clone?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I never even heard of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I never grew it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it on Mr. Nice?
[SPEAKER_03]: The FFA was being passed around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think they were the ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was confusing it with cabana because it
was, uh, um, mass super skunk crossed to
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't remember what the second part
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you Woody Kush or something weird?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I always thought it was cabana,
but maybe it was Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, but it was funny because it was
called free for all because it's supposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to be free for everyone to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got immediately locked,
you know, in those situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris had probably the best sour diesel
cut of all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the East coast for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd you, where'd you source that in
CSD Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one I gave to Harry Palms
that he used in all his sour crosses for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for Bloomco for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had originally, when I first got to
Denver in 2009, I got it at a cam from
[SPEAKER_02]: Anna C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the Choco cut or ECSD Choco?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, honestly, I think it was a Fino from
Rez's, uh, sour D, uh, 3.0, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, was pretty representative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, over the years,
I grew the hell out of that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I perfected it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, people pass me the AJ cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: People pass me some like fish tour,
ECSD cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: People pass me like four or five other
sour diesels and nothing stood up to this
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once again, I'm not going to
like, you know, based on the breeder or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, but it's like that, that shit
was the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really fire sour diesel cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I said, Harry, Harry Palms
has been breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, I passed that to a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one, um, that came out of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may be not out of Colorado, but it was
passed by, you guys know Stacy J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the one who passed it to,
uh, it made its way to Caleb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one the CSI uses today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're used to come to a bunch of cabana
gatherings.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get him on the show sometime.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about it forever,
but that dude's got a history going back
[SPEAKER_03]: to the 77 crew and all of it, dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, he runs the overgrow
reunion page on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows all the old school guys,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude, legit motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really, really respect that dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw now that this is another cool thing
about the cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you know differently, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just mistaken, but, uh,
knucklehead just posted up that he spoke
[SPEAKER_01]: to Loran the other day and he's cancer
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was under the impression that Loran
had passed away in December, but no,
[SPEAKER_01]: Loran is alive and well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the type of things that you can
just randomly learn over on the cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I remember, uh, cause we got all
the old guys who actually talk to Loran
[SPEAKER_01]: still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I remember, uh, Chimera posted
at one point that Tom Hill had died,
[SPEAKER_03]: killed himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember eulogizing Tom Hill and
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here he is popping up again later
on like, Oh, is there anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia or something now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, he's, he's, he's up north in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's being Tom Hill is as Tommy as he
gets, he's going to be watching this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee he's always in the chat rooms
under the name Jay cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big daddy, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the, uh, 10 pound, uh, plant
threads from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were a real inspiration for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one, that one specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thread that in the Tom Hill forum,
like that 10 pound plant outdoor thread,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I had like this, a wealth of
knowledge, like, like probably a third of
[SPEAKER_02]: what I've learned total about outdoor
growing came from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Hill Hayes times everything,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd support, I'd hit that to everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just recently did a repro or had
someone do a repro of the top hill say,
[SPEAKER_03]: so there's more of it back out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how good the selection is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hard part when people try and
bring back the old school genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: like man, mother, you know, parental stock
is different and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel some about old school seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know climate change or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were better back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Phil, Phil's, he did a big pop of
it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To pick, pick the one that he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you the exact number.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a really good selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Tom Hill's Hayes, as much as I love
Tom Hill, that shit was grass,
[SPEAKER_03]: carrots, and hay.
[SPEAKER_03]: 99% of it that I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 100% of what I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know there's good shit in there
because I've seen other people come across
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I saw come from Tom Hill was
fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolute fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hayes is one of those things that you got
to do bigger numbers in, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor of love, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had said it back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's why he only had like a
couple of genetics of the breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on a IC mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were all preservation runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't like, you know, he wasn't trying
to breed for any specific trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just like, here's the whole
hodgepodge of Hayes DNA smashed together
[SPEAKER_02]: for you to keep smashing together and keep
finding things for eternity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that's really what he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all locked and hidden in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be like a 10 pack from
any other breeder where you might find a
[SPEAKER_02]: winner in 10 or 20 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was always really open that it would be
like 10% keepers, 90% move.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a long time, he sold them cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd even get them as freebies on seed
bay and like, you'd be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more Hayes seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never grow these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everybody wants them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how everything like goes around
in circles like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even worse was the Sam the Skunk Man Ty
Skunk Hayes, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people got 90,000 packs of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I still have some of those
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thunk or whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran some reefer man original Hayes and
that shit went for like 17 weeks bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't even start showing pistols for
like week five or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many breeders, like you get their gear
and then they end up doing something and
[SPEAKER_01]: you feel like, you feel like you're on the
Epstein list or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you got, he definitely got,
he definitely got on that list,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, he, uh, he split up me and Neville,
me and Neville were doing a project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, that was like a once in a
lifetime thing to be able to work with
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville, the guy who started it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, reefer man was playing real cool
with me and having Neville like source
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff for me, making promises.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get this from him?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, dude, he has a bad rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't sending him shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, I got it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he fucks you, I'll cover it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then reefer man slowly started telling
Neville, yeah, if you work with Matt,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to look poor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to look like a poor person
because he's not, he's not well loved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure enough, split it down the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and Neville never finished the projects
in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used some of the stuff that we didn't
do it together, you know, past that six
[SPEAKER_03]: months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then reefer man ripped them off and
bailed, you know, it's just like one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those things where it just, I can't change
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was some good shit in some of
his shit, you know, like the, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: butterscotch Hawaiian had some killer shit
in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I find out that was made by
scabby from white Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking mirrors everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you feel about how you feel about
people white label, white labeling seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've done it for, you know,
like that's when, when me and karma were
[SPEAKER_03]: friends, I would, I would make seats where
I let them white label them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think it's a necessity for some
breeders now and an only way for a good
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders to make some money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I do have issues with the people who
take those white label seeds and pretend
[SPEAKER_03]: to breed them and pretend that they're
doing something they're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have a lot of respect for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do realize that it's an important part
of the industry and it's always going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be there, but you know, like walking
around wearing lab coats, pretending
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing all this selection and
pictures and stuff, and then going to buy
[SPEAKER_03]: your CD to be selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a ton of respect for it,
but I realize it's a necessary evil,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in other ways, I don't fault the
breeders who do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's always going to be there and
I've done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the coast breeding for other people
so that they could get like this great
[SPEAKER_03]: reputation of being breeders, like karma,
you know, just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally I wouldn't even say their name,
you know, there's plenty more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that most people don't
know about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people don't know about it and don't
understand how often it happens and it
[SPEAKER_03]: just is part of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you think are the best seed vendors
these days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Vendors or breeders?
[SPEAKER_03]: Vendors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's only a few that I think really
go for the idea of quality over quantity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there are people that I like as
humans that run seed banks, like I like
[SPEAKER_03]: James Bean as a human.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate about 90% of the people he carries
because I know for a fact they're frauds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and like he pushes that
whole thing where it's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I vouch for everybody, you know,
shit like that bothers me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's good companies in
Australia called Gert by seeds is a good
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one here called lifted genetics
that really goes out of their way to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure everybody they carry actually breeds,
does hard work, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's few and far between.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so few and far between.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody who even knows what they're
carrying, most of the guys that don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: shit about the genetics are selling or the
people's doing the quote unquote work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I think what you're going
to do is going to be super fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are like, I haven't access
to things that are smaller projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're not meant for the
masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to, they're meant for,
they're bent for Cabana members.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have no respect for the
attitude, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just another market for frauds to
help frauds push the shit seed resellers,
[SPEAKER_03]: free marketing shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That isn't what they say it is that
they're buying in bulk repackaging under
[SPEAKER_01]: their different always literally just
sometimes I'll check out the attitude just
[SPEAKER_01]: for shits and giggles and the list of
breeders that I see on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always shocked at who I see on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always shocked at like,
who the fuck is this dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea who 80% of the breeders on
the attitude are these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was, you know, there was a company
called best coast genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at the other day and having
to giggle at, cause they were selling Ms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jill's stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were selling all these fake versions
of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a picture of, uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying it was chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go look at it in a straight
cookies, you know, like, like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it seats here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, dude, you should know better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just even by looking at this picture,
you should know that's not chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, and it even says chem 91
clone only.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, oh, that's fucking cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, ah, that's a chem 91 is an ugly
fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I get, I get, there's always going
to be a need that it's not anything I can
[SPEAKER_03]: do to make it go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with this show, I've done everything I
can to break down the myths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it ruins my reputation,
doing it, even if I am the villain for
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it, I'll never stop fucking doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten snitched on for doing what I
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Swat teams at my door for doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will keep doing it just because
someone's, someone's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I, hopefully I'm right all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just my perspective too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I can't always be right,
but I try to get it as right as I can
[SPEAKER_03]: before I say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually if I say something negative about
someone, it's someone I've had direct
[SPEAKER_03]: interaction and know enough about them to
say, yeah, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard these days, but, uh,
over at the cabana, we're all pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty friendly over there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to, I try to like keep that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to keep that kind of shit to my own
show and my own space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a whole new map these days,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to be a little nicer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hardest part for me too,
is I try and be nicer too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Oki and Chris will tell you,
I mean, I'm a nice guy, but I'm also an
[SPEAKER_01]: asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I can't snap out of asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen curb handle some negative
interactions on the cabana recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm reading what he says.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, like, bro, this is like the
Kirby that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very, you know, like diplomatic
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been very diplomatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying, I'm trying to be because the,
you know, Howie and D man and skitty,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, uh, as harsh as their rules were,
they listened, they would hear you out
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, they would listen to if somebody
wanted to talk to them about an issue or a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, like, you know, you know,
they heard it and, uh, I'm, I can't fix
[SPEAKER_01]: every problem and do everything that
everybody wants on the cabana,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I am trying and skitty is helping me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so he's doing pretty much all of my
technical stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I have a problem, I hit skitty
up and be like, Hey man, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody told me the backgrounds aren't
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't change their backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't know anything about
computers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want to set you guys up a discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have some sort of like,
uh, I think that they can work integrate
[SPEAKER_03]: really well to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for like an all time chat room verse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a live chat on the cabana that I
want people to start utilizing pop up in
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a live chat on the cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to go to an external
website.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my hold up on the store right
now is, um, I'm having an issue with
[SPEAKER_01]: credit card payment processors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be your hardest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's such a pain in the ass,
but one of the things is visa has sent out
[SPEAKER_03]: some major, major, or made major issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even if you can get a credit card
process or visa has hit two of the major
[SPEAKER_03]: seed banks with $250,000 fines per
transaction that they find people using
[SPEAKER_03]: visa to buy cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if the processor lets you run
through and do it, visa will come after
[SPEAKER_03]: your ass and come after you for 250 K per
transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little tips of the trades that I've been
gathering from so many people who vend
[SPEAKER_01]: their own seeds on their own websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking to everybody and,
uh, I used to be the king of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for, for 15 years, I was the only one
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say you, you were the first
one who always had your own site.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to, everybody hated my ass,
but man, that's the, you probably did
[SPEAKER_01]: better than everybody else because you
didn't have any middle man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you did half the volume,
you're making the same amount of money
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're doing it all yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had one credit card company that
worked with me for seven years and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made the mistake of telling one
person that I thought I trusted who I
[SPEAKER_03]: used, and then they fucked me over and
then turned me into the credit card
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I lost it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ever since then, and I started to go
back to look into using them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, a few of the big,
big seed banks got hit by visa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, there is no fucking way I
wouldn't blow my brains out after getting
[SPEAKER_03]: a $250,000 fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So until, until, until major banks are
willing to work with it, I would be very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very hesitant to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Bitcoin, there's pressure,
the other things you can use in the
[SPEAKER_03]: meantime and get around it before we get
involved with the visa, because they are a
[SPEAKER_03]: nightmare right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are literally chasing cannabis
seed sales specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have someone on that 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So funny how like, you know, they do the
farm bill and they say it's legal and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody kind of starts you know,
you see it really open up and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: banks are popping up and now people are,
you know, you got clones going every which
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but then they still don't,
you know, they're mad about the money
[SPEAKER_01]: still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they can find a way to fully get
their hands on that fucking money.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when it starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's not good for us,
but it's, we got to, we got to mint like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Savannah crypto token that we can use for
buying and selling feeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do like a bean for bean trading
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's get a thread up there where
it's like, man, I got this pack of beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it back to the days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trains where it's at trade up,
trade for what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone else gets what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you got cards, everything you know
about trading.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do a UFC card thing on there
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some people at a UFC cards,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, and like the week, you see those weed
cards that I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, there's a couple of breeders,
like small guys on the cabana and the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a breeder man, start a
thread in the breeders forum, show us what
[SPEAKER_01]: you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some, there's a couple of guys
over there who are selling packs that come
[SPEAKER_01]: with like a pack of weed cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the collectible aspect of that,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, because you know what these days,
man, so many of these people, and I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: hating on seed collectors, cause I'm a
huge seed collector.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a ton that I'm not going to pop,
but a lot of these guys just collect seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and they want like baseball cards and they
want the ones with the dopest packaging
[SPEAKER_01]: with the, you know, the limited run
something or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want that and I'm not fought them
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're buying my, I appreciate it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the genetics match the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That big fucking uncut sheet of cards from
the inline 1994 series.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of people don't know those
things existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mill, Frank, Rob Clark, they took all
those pictures in the seventies and
[SPEAKER_03]: eighties of Panama red, silver Pearl,
all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're in this old, it's called the
inline hemp series cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my homie went to a storage space of
some dude and picked up the uncut fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: sheets, which in the card collecting
world, that is rare as fuck to get an
[SPEAKER_03]: uncut sheet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he picked up like 20 of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to be handing those out to
some of the homies, you know, probably
[SPEAKER_03]: worth a few grand, but yeah, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are awesome to have stuff like that,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, Bobby O gave me a bunch of old,
old seed catalogs, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just moved and I don't know where
they're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to dig them up and I want
pictures of all of them in case the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that don't have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post them up in your threads in your
forum over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's some cool stuff in it and
just the history and seeing where we were
[SPEAKER_01]: to where we're at in the genetics game.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's also so important of learning
about what's in your current day genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those catalogs have opened up a world for
me, absolute world of understanding what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working with, what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville did a great job of describing and
documenting his stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, like on, on a,
on our breeder syndicate discord,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have all those catalogs up for everyone
to see, you know, the joins and and I put
[SPEAKER_03]: them up for free on the command as well,
because I think it's important to share
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're on it, even playing field so that
there's no, you know, information being
[SPEAKER_03]: secret scrolled away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything like that should be seen so we
can all learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all bullshit we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: As close as we can get to facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, back in the day, they actually,
they wanted to tell you what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these days, like, I'm so skeptical of
when people even say, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, this is runs or lemon cherry gelato or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what cut are you doing this with?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all gelato looks the same,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you could pass off whatever is
whatever the dead end breeding section,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's so many gelato crosses
and S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, do you really are you really
rocking this to G 33 or G, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: gelato 41 or what does this really cross
to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think there's a fair
majority of the market out there where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, they have a nice cut of
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not faulting them, but is it really
the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know most of the market won't know
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the fuck do they care?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shortcut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collecting is it's a, it's a thing in
itself that takes time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to make relationships,
earn trust from people to get some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these rare old cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these guys just don't get
that because they didn't have the forum
[SPEAKER_03]: experience, which is why I like,
I, I impressed so hard on some of this
[SPEAKER_03]: next generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a chance to be, to learn what we
went through during our era by joining the
[SPEAKER_03]: Kavana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interacting there, you get some of
that forum experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get to learn some of the ins and outs,
the do's and don'ts, what stepping on toes
[SPEAKER_03]: really means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's all there to be learned,
like learn it, learn the culture,
[SPEAKER_03]: keep the culture alive for us,
you know, and you got to respect the clone
[SPEAKER_01]: or the seed or whatever, because you'll
see real quick, like on the cabana,
[SPEAKER_01]: like news, we might not have that much
traffic, but news spreads like wild fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you did, you know, something to
somebody or, you know, they're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be on the do not, do not send clone
lists real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old black list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a damn sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a damn sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy to get on the,
we'll help you out list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's even easier to get on the,
we don't fuck with you list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cause as much as, as much as the
industry and the community's grown,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still a pretty small club,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone kind of still knows
everybody, you know, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: like young crews that are really like
making motion on their own that aren't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, falling on the back,
standing on the backs of giants,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we're all still connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're just sitting here trading
stories that we were all bumping elbows 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, and if you're still in it now and
the plan on being in it for the next 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years, you're going to, you know,
you're going to bump into people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've always said that,
like you can't, you can't burn bridges in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry because it comes back around
real easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some, some people are just here to
make a quick buck, I guess, and get out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's, I don't think that's any of us
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've all got issues with being obsessed
with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had dreams about it, like close your eyes
and that's what you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you, you know,
eat, live, sleep, whatever, all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, I got this old original,
I don't know if you can see here,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's the old original Hayes cosmic
boogie poster probably spent fucking way
[SPEAKER_03]: more than I'd ever care to admit on that
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's because I live dreams,
sleep strains, you know, the marketing,
[SPEAKER_03]: the history, the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know all you guys do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the most you ever spent on a pack
of seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a few grand, like realistically
on some old Cali mist, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few grand when seed money was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't good no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to, man, I was a sniper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the sniper on seed bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the most you ever spent?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a few grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: On what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a Rez sour diesel of some
kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he'd always do limited drops and
then auctions and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I first got into seeds,
like buying seeds, Rez was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he was the new generation kind
of like top dog at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his gear was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I'm on some anti Rez shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no questions there, but his gear was
fire back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he was using legitimate shit,
using the real Chem D using real sour to
[SPEAKER_03]: do what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way it wasn't ahead of its
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish he was a lot nicer and you
know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't like swerve worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were both on the cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny Rez actually hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like about forums and he's like,
how do you get a forum on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was just like, yeah,
I just picked the homies and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not going to have a forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, you know, like, you know,
I don't have any hate towards the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's he's been cordial to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the snitch thing for me after
being not even after being snitched.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never like snitched, but like after
dealing with what I dealt with the past
[SPEAKER_03]: two years, getting attacked by,
you know, his was such a big deal at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It scared a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember deleting all of my pictures on
ICMAG and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to pack all the evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour DIBL and that was his contribution to
the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like like I remember going
through packs and packs when he did his
[SPEAKER_02]: chem DIBL and I had all the chem cut,
you know, and I was like, these are all
[SPEAKER_02]: just like leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: His PX2 was way better than the IBL.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have some.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he when he worked with the chem,
I didn't think he did anything amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I think I think JJ had the
chem in a much better place back then than
[SPEAKER_02]: than Rez did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rez got lucky with the sour and was
able to, you know, get that in a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good representation in seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was his contribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he went down, he did
everybody dirty and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that showed his true colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just never nice to begin with,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was always a fucking dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like always a dick, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would spend so much money on seeds and
trying to ask a question and like get
[SPEAKER_01]: ignored for months and then get the word
reply of like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he had a lot of troll accounts
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was he got a high end loan system
removed from IC mag for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll never forget that shit either.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's my boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was trying to get to the bottom of
the chem story before anybody else was.
[SPEAKER_03]: He started to get one on one thread.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a lot of people off him
trying to get to the bottom of that story
[SPEAKER_03]: because nothing was making fucking sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, now we know a lot more than we
did then and still pissing people off with
[SPEAKER_03]: that info.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people never give up and they'll
always have their own versions of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I go with what makes the most sense to
me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like after after being able to
ask one, a lot of these plants go through
[SPEAKER_03]: their populations, seeing what lies in
them, out crossing them, seeing what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're getting in the outcrosses tells the
real story of what's in these plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: just knowing other lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being able to see what was in their
room, get a good idea, run those lines,
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find out Chem 91 is the pure one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem Sys, the original Chem Sys,
not Chem A, which was the second Chem Sys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original Chem Sys was probably a
sister of Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything else is a hybrid or a hybrid of
a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get to the Chem 1 through 4,
which is like an NL5 haze Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chem D would be like a Chem 91 mass
super scout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that became very true and easy
to see after some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't like those stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are not stories that help their
situations, even though like they were in
[SPEAKER_03]: their teens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I get why they would say what they
did and did what they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, no blame there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Chem Dog Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's always been so cool to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know, plants don't lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it's always turned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people are just ignorant,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not ignorant, just,
you know, unconsciously ignorant to what,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you get a plant and
it's not like you get a piece of paper
[SPEAKER_01]: with a, you know, a carfax on this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you got to take it, you got to take
it for what it is and what you can make
[SPEAKER_01]: off of it and then see what happens with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point, Chem Dog said, anything that
comes from me is Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the first telling
things, you know, and then certainly as
[SPEAKER_03]: over the years, as people started getting
different Chem D clones that came directly
[SPEAKER_03]: from him and comparing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all find out nine Chem Ds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all kind of similar, but not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when things like really started
hitting the fan and it became very obvious
[SPEAKER_03]: something different had happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem D is so recognizable, you know,
if you've grown it, you can spot it
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we had the real Chem D back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was probably, that was probably
all, you know, hops late and also before
[SPEAKER_02]: we knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that high maintenance like need for
the plant, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, last time I talked to Canorado,
he was still growing all the same Chem
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuts that I passed him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was like years ago on the
forum with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was just a tent grower before he
was a breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just was just begging for like a
legit Chem Cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember people was like,
oh, you're just a tent grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt bad for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I had this warehouse and,
you know, I was like, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, you're right down the street for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just meet you at this gas station.
[SPEAKER_02]: I taught them the 91, the four and the D,
you know, and I think he's still the same
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts he has till this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if his are legit, mine were legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was, that was the cuts we all
had from the crew that all was like from
[SPEAKER_02]: Hallie, from the Cabana, everybody that
was on the Cabana then had the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still rocking them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So is Canorado still rocking them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm no girl right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I'll get back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything we can ever do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let me know too.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll, we'll jump up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be jumping back on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple of things in the works
for the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, I've been, you know,
stuck in the, in the corporate matrix of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a, it's been, you know,
just a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's nice to have these
conversations about the old days and like
[SPEAKER_02]: still know that there's people that care
about not just the history, but genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves about the plant, the quality,
you know, like, cause it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the piece that's really missing,
you know, everything can't just be sales
[SPEAKER_02]: and marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's no substance to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're losing a piece of that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the, the pendulum will swing in
the industry the other way in a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years, but you got a whole new generation
of, of young smokers, consumers that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, they don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to be educated, you know,
and they, they don't know what's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I forgot who was it just posted it on
blacklist or something on, on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: like in the last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone in the comments was like,
Oh, all weed came from cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, and people were making
memes about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, we do from cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like, you know,
but that's, that's because that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: the information, there's no good data,
like neutral information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing there is this place is like
the cabana because everything else has a
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing spin and agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, there's a lack of purity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what was beautiful about those
old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we were all just excited to
just have it and be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what some people don't realize about
the cabana is it was an invite only like
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody had to invite you, you had to get
approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really like limited, like the stock
of people that we had were already top
[SPEAKER_01]: tier, you know, and the, you know,
all these breeders that we talk about and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, they were all members of the cabana
at some point, you know, they got invited,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were on there for, you know,
and they were part of the special
[SPEAKER_01]: community because it was special to be
part of something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody could be on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody could be on the cabana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them do even know command existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, it was invisible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could Google it and nothing would come
up unless you typed in the exact web
[SPEAKER_01]: address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exact web address up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would never find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was by design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been, it's been crazy doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, it's been crazy trying to
adjust to the new modern times and try and
[SPEAKER_01]: make the cabana feel that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's still kind of exclusive,
but open to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's been the hardest part,
but it, I think people are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more visitors averaging online
every day now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're any given time there's,
you know, close to a hundred visitors on
[SPEAKER_01]: online now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are small numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about, you know,
THC farmer and IC mag, but they've been
[SPEAKER_03]: open 20 years to the public quality over
quantity, brother quality over quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so come, come over to the cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody to register.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need people to register.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the driving force.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start commenting, get some threads up
there and website scrolling across the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom here again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there should be no confusion about how
to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no fucking excuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fellas and ladies, more ladies would be
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we got ideas to do anything,
you know, you guys can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys got an idea for the forums,
I think the seed store is going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: most vital thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we've talked about it, you know,
having something that's free of all this
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing and hype bullshit, something
that's like a neutral territory for people
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy, sell, trade genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's huge because I mean,
even Matt said it, like there's no real
[SPEAKER_02]: domestic seed vendors that are even doing
it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everything is just pumping hype and
marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you just have like this neutral
playing ground, you know, and in addition
[SPEAKER_02]: to that, it's basically where we can have
open discourse and discussion about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but just the neutral, you know,
marketplace of, of, of seeds were,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, any breeder can go up there and
just list it, but you're not, you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: getting extra hype over anybody else
because you're paying more because like
[SPEAKER_02]: every breeder is just on that even playing
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's about the genetics and like,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we're in 2024 and we still don't have
an online seed vendor that exists that
[SPEAKER_02]: that can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really truly believe there needs to be
some vetting too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's going to be people,
of course, that don't have big followings
[SPEAKER_03]: that should be on there because we know
that they've been making seats forever and
[SPEAKER_03]: are good people, but there are just so
many shitbags that'll sign up that are
[SPEAKER_03]: just going to exploit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a hard part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the forum is for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So complete, complete ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's you grow this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're somebody that we've
never heard of that can show and prove
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, of course you're not going to be
a vendor on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily we got enough vendors that can
show and prove that I've been doing this a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time that are trustworthy that I got
no problem making people wait until they
[SPEAKER_01]: can, until they can show and prove.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to, you got to go through the
process and prove yourself and then boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and you know, most scammers
won't go through the process of doing that
[SPEAKER_03]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of weeds them out pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be some work you want to,
you want to be able to offer seeds on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some work, but that's
through the actual store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want people to know that on the cabana
right now, just as the general community,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an open market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome to talk to people and if
they have things that you're interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're willing to tell pictures of my
feet, you know, just get it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that there's a couple of people
on there that might be into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you never know what kind of market you
might find.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, man, trade some seeds,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a, you know, let's get some garden
picks up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let people know what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, it's always been a community of
sharing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want people to know that it's,
you know, boom, share, get on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually got a long ass episode,
which is fucking perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably going to cut it into two,
but I want to see any of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with Oki.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me some last shout outs and things
you want to get out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any certain ideas you want to come across
or you want to get across overall this
[SPEAKER_03]: episode?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm just, uh, happy to be invited
here and show some support for,
[SPEAKER_05]: for curb and, uh, the cabana and,
uh, you know, like, uh, like curb had
[SPEAKER_05]: said, uh, uh, the can of cabana times and
the barbecue days were really like,
[SPEAKER_05]: probably one of the most fun and special
times of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you know, I, uh, I hope that,
uh, curb has, uh, success in bringing that
[SPEAKER_05]: to, uh, you know, a new generation and a
much wider, uh, you know, mass of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to give Oki some promo because I
don't think he's going to do it for
[SPEAKER_01]: himself, but, uh, go to his Instagram,
Borneo bud, Borneo bud Brian, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, check out this facility that he just
built down in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's state of the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got, uh, he's doing phenol hunts of
different seeds all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some great genetics and they're
crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the, they're the number one brand
down in Mississippi right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me an address.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the, on the cabana, send me an address
to send you some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Chris, what you've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, man, this is, uh, we got to cover a
lot of bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, I got to say a lot of things
I wanted to say, you know, little things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just a can of con in Oklahoma city
last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people came out that were
homies and there's still, there's still
[SPEAKER_02]: community out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still feel blessed to be in this
industry, even though it's morphed and
[SPEAKER_02]: changed that I got in almost every legal
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got people that I consider, you know,
good friends that come out that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, so there's still a lot of
like, like positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all kind of went down a little bit of a
negative wormhole about different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of things that suck,
but we're calling them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, I just, you know,
want to end it on a positive note and say
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that it's still a beautiful time to
be alive and be doing this and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: and be talking about a plant that gets as
high, you know, and, and be making a
[SPEAKER_02]: living off of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so let me just say that, um,
of course I got to say thank you to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to hort grow, you know, if you guys need
cocoa, like I said, cleanest, best quality
[SPEAKER_02]: cocoa building a whole story around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I got some other things in the
pipeline coming soon, possibly a nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: line that I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, of course, supporting Kirby with the
cabana with everything, just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: grateful for my time in California,
grateful for my time in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: grateful for my time, even in Oklahoma,
even Bakersfield, Arden, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, like there's so many places that I
feel at home at, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that cannabis that this plant has
brought me to, like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been around the world to four
continents, thanks to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like literally, you know,
Columbia, Morocco, Spain, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam, all over all four time zones of
the U S so, um, just, uh, just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of gratitude for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still think there's a lot of future,
um, for people that are, are really
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on, on quality and working with
good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being a good person, I don't think you
have to sell your soul to make a living in
[SPEAKER_02]: this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's just the trend right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll say this about Chris is,
uh, he's the guy I always call when I got
[SPEAKER_01]: a question, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and I'm going to give you way too
technical of an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell him every time I'm like,
dumb it down for me, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to me like I'm stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he knows how to explain it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he, he, he will give you the buy
the book answer on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I appreciate being able to calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can take your, um, nutrient lines and
reverse engineer them, help you with dry
[SPEAKER_01]: salt formulas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did great things, uh, for me out in
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he helped Oki down in Mississippi
as well with, uh, some dry salt stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who's got questions with that
hit them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got people off Athena.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all essentially the same thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can, uh, he can get you guys dialed in
and, um, he's got a help desk for Hort
[SPEAKER_01]: grow on the cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you got any questions, uh,
you can hit them up on the cabana,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, right on his forum, post your
questions, get a, you know, a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public conversation going about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got the Hort grow discount for the
cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to their forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the cabana code, get 15% off a
Hort grow order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you, Kirby?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I appreciate the opportunity to win
skiddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had kind of tossed it out to demon
or a optimist a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: About, you know, let me do something with
the cabana and try something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, uh, the right time came and they
gave me the opportunity to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate them so much,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know it meant a lot to all three
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a big deal to let me do
something totally different with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked to Howie all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to D man all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He helps me on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, uh, everything site related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and skiddy does all the technical
stuff for me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been great to, I talked to
them on a way more frequent, regular basis
[SPEAKER_01]: now since taking over the cabana than I
had for a couple of years there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been nice just to have regular
communication with those guys and for them
[SPEAKER_01]: to trust me to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great that I got so many homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homies that want to be involved that I've
met over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it's slow, everybody's
still involved in pushing for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just need to get it popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we can have something that's
super cool and unique, different than
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram and different than, uh,
the other sites, you know, be kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more modernized and yeah,
I want, you know, cool kids again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get these registrations up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate all the support from
everybody, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope people take advantages of the
new things that they can do on the cabana
[SPEAKER_01]: and the history that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's make some new history,
post some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole new generation of strains
and clones and information that's
[SPEAKER_01]: underrepresented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so let's get some new information up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: From everybody, you know, and it's super
easy to, you can take your posts from
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram and just copy the link and put
them in your posts, um, uh, in the cabana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the reply thread, just copy the link
from Instagram, put it in there and boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll put that picture right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super easy to upload pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, everything should be a lot more user
friendly with the new platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully people are figuring out any
questions, holla at me, D man,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody I'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I appreciate the support from
everybody, Matt, for having us on here and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing multiple shows and listening to us
jabber about stuff that I thought only me
[SPEAKER_01]: and Chris and Oki cared about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's funny, dude, in doing the
syndicate, when I first started doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this, like it was an Instagram live feed,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there would be like 20 people in there
listening to yap about genetics and
[SPEAKER_03]: slowly, but surely ended up being,
you know, 300, 400 people watching live.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and at no time did I think it would
ever surpass that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually it was just people trying to
egg me on to talk shit about stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I brought it onto YouTube and
realized now we've got this discord of 500
[SPEAKER_03]: people and they're all super interested in
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them from the next generation and
it's given me a lot of hope because I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't have a lot of hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: For any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just goes to show, like you put in
the work, it'll fucking happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you stick with it, you put in the work,
it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can all make a big fucking change.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can re re reignite this culture
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you, that's been the hardest thing
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm actually like, I mentioned it
before, like I'm a natural hater,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm really trying to embrace the,
the new generation, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to give them a lot more credit
than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'd naturally want to hate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate on some of these guys, but then
sometimes I see what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, you know, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, never forget that you can learn
something from the young guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: A prime example of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're going super long here,
but a prime example of learning from the
[SPEAKER_01]: young guys, big Willie man out in NorCal
Willie's garden and greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a young kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known him for forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he grinds harder than anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works nonstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always like, like grinding hard and
he's learning new tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he taught me a ton of stuff over the
years, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always listen to the young guys,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a good crew of young ones in our
close circle to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It blows my mind that there are young guys
that give a fuck about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, it gives me a lot of
hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, uh, even this episode,
people fucking loved it the last episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to love this episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more, more often we do this,
the more we integrate, the more,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more change we can make together guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to see that seed site pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think that'll be a big difference
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate you guys for carrying that
fucking torch, uh, keeping the forums
[SPEAKER_03]: alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to all of us that were
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's important to share the
culture with the younger guys who were and
[SPEAKER_03]: give them an opportunity to get part of
what we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's make it our own again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram's not our friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fucking not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's easy and it's accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's what everybody does,
but man, it's a dying medium and your shit
[SPEAKER_03]: can be gone overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden you're not connected
to anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is someone else's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not yours anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come on over the Cabana man,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you having us, uh,
anytime man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate all you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure talking to all you guys
face to face and let's do this again soon
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it's just a fuck around table,
shooting the shit about where we think,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the culture's going, you know,
anything topical news.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fellas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that salute you guys,
we'll be back again next week and
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully we can get some of these fellas
on again very soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to take a quick moment and
thank everyone for showing up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kirby and all the homies from,
from the Cabana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they're always amazing episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are real passionate through
seed collectors and what they're doing at
[SPEAKER_03]: the Cabana.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really supportive of again,
the can of Cabana.com is where you go to
[SPEAKER_03]: sign up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can also go to riotseeds.com
again, to pick up our blueberry and cross
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.

announce on four 18, we got the high and
[SPEAKER_03]: lonesome's new mango Hayes drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we finally have Matt elites,
uh, different chem D I 95 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Been working on it for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are in my opinion, the best chem 91
regular seeds where you can reliably pick
[SPEAKER_03]: out like amplified chem 91 Terps,
along with a bunch of really true breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: through OG Kush seed lines and regular
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can make your own OG Kush seed
lines with the mills from this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Matt elite stuff is above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why I've hounded him for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only going to be a few packs
available of each.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to, he doesn't think there's
going to be a lot of interest because he's
[SPEAKER_03]: missed the seed market the last,
I don't know, four or five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please go check that out at riotseeds

blueberry and cross out to Australia,
