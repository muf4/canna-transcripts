[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_04]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_04]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_04]: seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_04]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_04]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_04]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_04]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew here with my co-host,
Thousandfold, and today we're going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about outdoor growing from
beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And go ahead, Thousand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, we're going to be talking
about beginning to end of flowering,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we welcome back Booze, Kush of the
Giants, Little Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each of them have featured before on their
various respective episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll try to remember to add links to
each of those in the description.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so today we are talking about
flowering outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, we have Kush of the Giants
in Little Hill, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got Booze actually from
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be an interesting contrast,
for one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, to kick things off,
I thought we could just go around and each
[SPEAKER_03]: of you give a brief outline of what you're
outdoor growing situation is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: your respective area, and what you've
grown this season, I should say,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to start things off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can start with Little Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what I'm growing this season or
where I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Southern Trinity, 3,200 feet
elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a mountain valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a rare thing up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very mountainous territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a whole lot of valley,
flat sort of level valley areas up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of lucky in that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,200 feet coastal range, like deep,
deep in the coastal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my season is shorter than
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, we get freezes into June
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll definitely start freezing at some
point in October, usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't happened yet, but we've gotten
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've actually got some good
weather right now coming up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: forecast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've gotten a lot of rain this year
so far, more than usual, which we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely made me speed things
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as what I'm growing, I think we
covered a lot of what I used to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors in the last episode that I was
on, Betsy and Heart Attack and Pineapple
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that, Purple Rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of stopped growing outdoor
for a few years as legalization kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: moved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I transitioned to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I had was in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was depping everything, basically,
and then replanting for a second run,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually under full-term sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, this past season, I've got to
expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cheapest way to expand is just
building some outdoor beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only six inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the native soil underneath them
is all tilled and amended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I've got 10 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like loose soil between the native
soil on the bottom and potting soil on
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the potting soil is
all amended with dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried a bunch of different strains,
kind of like every strain I had on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of gave it a bed just to see what's
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is all new genetics for me in
the outdoor environment, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some things don't matter, like
finishing time and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on outdoor full-term, it absolutely
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's going to mold?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can withstand the rain?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can withstand the cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: What yields still like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the final product look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it marketable as an outdoor plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also planted very small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each 5 by 96 bed is a row of three with
like 50 to 50 five rows of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like whatever that is,
170 plants in each bed or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give or take, like the numbers vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're only like at most, say,
six foot tall plants, single colas for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part, very tightly grown in very
tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not giants because plant numbers
mean nothing at this point with
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strains, I'm running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of see my garden from the
window here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some compound genetics, none of
which I'm not stoked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jokers, grapple pie, and carbon fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my cut of T1000 triangle from CSI
that I selected several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just done killer so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ice cream cake, papaya bomb, and OG Kush
S1 from CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different selected phenos of 707 Kush
and 707 OG from 707 Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I'm forgetting something,
but I can't think of it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so just a huge variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually grow that many different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, it'll be like three or four
strains in that whole area instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mishmash.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the reasons why I wanted to get
three of you specifically, the three of
[SPEAKER_03]: you, is because each of you are actually
growing on a very different scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's going to be really
interesting to get to later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other reason that I really wanted
the three of you on, because each of you
[SPEAKER_03]: has a great Instagram, in all honesty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each of you are actually, in my
opinion, really, really good archivists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way you document your grows and
all that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think both Little Hill and Booz,
you guys both do really nice running
[SPEAKER_03]: commentaries on what you're doing on
audio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Kush does these really cool
write-ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, that's just kind of extending
the intro a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, thank you so much for that,
Little Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we go to Kush next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about your general outdoor growing
situation and what you've been growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so for me, it's real similar to
Little Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just opposite county of him across the
valley, about 3,400 elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, similar with I have a little
valley on the side of the mountain where
[SPEAKER_01]: generally, we don't get a lot of flat
ground to grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the benefits of that and being right
next to a little creek up in the mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: too, it helps a lot with what I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my growing situation now is,
it started with wanting to get weed
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started growing,
that was my initial goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I eventually got some customers
and grew enough and people wanted some.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it turned into growing weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then around 2018 or 2019, people just
stopped buying weight so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just started turning to what I
liked and not only what I liked,
[SPEAKER_01]: but started popping stuff that I've never
had the chance to grow before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to see what performed
well out in my area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been an explorative journey since
about 2018, mostly popping stuff through
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI and his unreal vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: You order a little bit of seeds from him
and you end up with more than you can pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what I've been doing
now is just going through old populations
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff that people talked about in the
past, stuff that I used to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: but never got a chance to grow myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been really fun exploring and
testing the limits of these strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the mold and the mildew and
the late season strength of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as what I'm growing this year,
it's the biggest variety of plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever grown this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's for more seed, more guys from the
syndicate and a wider variety of breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: than I've ever messed with this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Pax ATW Hybrid, that are just
absolutely gorgeous, pure tealing with all
[SPEAKER_01]: those berry flavors coming in behind them,
which is really cool for the tealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that Blue Resin Kush from Matt
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a little late, but man, she smells
amazing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing some, what else are we
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, the Sweet 16 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I don't know, shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was laid into the seed and then CSI hit
me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Hey man, I got some of these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow these out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, it's pretty late,
man, but they look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried the Sweet 16 before, so let's give
it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, I'm just blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got six different Sweet 16 hybrids and
each of them are completely just
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful, frosty, all the unique smells,
turf profiles that I've never encountered
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just strange stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the Blackberry wine had its own
uniqueness that you've never smelled
[SPEAKER_01]: before in the Sweet 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing some Appy stuff from High and
Lonesome, all the mangoey goodness that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really impressed with how those
perform outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structures there, the resins there,
the outdoor hardiness is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing a lot of the green crack
influence from the Appalachia that just
[SPEAKER_01]: holds up those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else are we running this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some of the Snitch Free Sour D from
our buddy Lush and his buddy, that plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a volatile fricking chemical lime
smell that's just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for her to finish up and see
what else we got on deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some of that cream, some of the 2016
bag seed cream that she's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's getting hit pretty hard by the mold,
but it makes sense when her buds are
[SPEAKER_01]: fricking decided.
[SPEAKER_01]: The size of softballs, you know,
they look like old Salmon Creek Big Bud
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane how big she's getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, other than that, not much else
that's growing in the garden this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that Isn't She Lovely from our buddy
Ananaki Genetics up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty impressive strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't expecting much out of it at
first, but she really blew me away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mixture of grape and pining,
which I've always had the two separated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had grape and pining share a
compound before, which it's really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really taken me by surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that plant a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, grape and pining together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I got my nose and I was
like, what the, that's those two,
[SPEAKER_01]: two I haven't smelled before together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool also that you, both you and
Little Hill seem to be dealing with more
[SPEAKER_03]: variety this season maybe than,
than normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll touch on that again later
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can go to booze.
[SPEAKER_03]: So booze obviously in Australia,
different timings.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, booze, tell us a bit about your,
your general situation growing outdoors
[SPEAKER_03]: there and what you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year I'm doing a little bit of a
scale back approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm planning on moving down south in
like five months or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't want to go away with doing
anything too crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan to move is to be able to do a lot
larger outdoor pops because somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: where land's a bit cheaper, be able to set
up some poly tunnels and get away with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, man, I've pretty much always
grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only started cultivating indoors last
year with about eight years of outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: experience prior to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's my love, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm pretty tall dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like being cramped inside a little
small tent space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't have a room or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just got a couple of tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm outdoors, I'm in my element.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything, bird song, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are all three of you big?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like all three of you are like
pretty big guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, man, I'm this year, I've just
got a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in a rental.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like a three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that in feet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like a 10 foot by 10 foot greenhouse
out the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm doing, what have I got at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some stuff from crybaby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, I've got a seed of throne,
which is a rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another friend of ours grew some of that
out and look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Afghan skunk from Mr. Nice
cross to like cheese, sour lemon tie,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Jesus onto that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting some, some really cool
plants out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just running clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a Yeager S1 from CSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ran a pack out of those last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the, what I kept out of that,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the most potent knock you on your
ass thing, but it's flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal for me, it's really medicinal
plants and helping a lot with nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuff like that indigestion,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the flavor on a man that like
licorice, mango, a little bit of like
[SPEAKER_02]: rotten garlic sort of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really complex, super terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else have I got?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've popped some, a friend of mine from
the forums back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't know him now, obviously I'm
young dude, but from the Mr. Nice forums,
[SPEAKER_02]: buckle bongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a guy on there and I linked up with
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got me in touch with a few Aussie
breeders who I've got on the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got some seeds of bazooka Joe,
which is like a fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: A soft bubble gum thing crossed to mocks,
which is the Mullum, O'Hark and NL five
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got like five of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a five of them going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some stone eight from high and
lonesome, which is the GG four cross to
[SPEAKER_02]: Appy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else have I got?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some, Oh, and I've just done a whole
pack of a five blue dream crossed to a
[SPEAKER_02]: five BC one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's from doc D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got 12 of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I said, a bit of a scale back
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I like to utilize my long season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where I am, I'm in a Queensland,
so pretty similar climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess parts of Hawaii, like I'm
fairly coastal, a lot of humidity,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much just year round.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we'll have about an hour and a half of
devency in, um, in daylight, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: hours come summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say like 14 and a half in summer,
11 and a half in winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a little bit of a variance,
but for the most part, man, you can crop
[SPEAKER_02]: like all year round, like I've got clones
out there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's starting to, you know,
obviously the daylight's changing
[SPEAKER_02]: daylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting longer now and nothing's
really re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will probably be able to run its
course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like what little hill was saying
with the light debt, that's what I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get into in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm too sketched at the moment,
like fucking getting out there at night
[SPEAKER_02]: and pulling a tarp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even when I was doing like
supplemental light in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just sketchy man, fucking neighbors
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like no fences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, one day, like once I get my,
my property, when I'm aiming at down
[SPEAKER_02]: south, that's what I want to get into
doing full season and light debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flaring shit out in summer, like unless
I'm going to be doing like some Colombians
[SPEAKER_02]: or like some of this, like Wally,
Wally duck gear or white Buffalo,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, flowering out like some indicators in
summer, it's just fucking mold man,
[SPEAKER_02]: mold city a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to get a run done in winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, mostly what I'm doing this year
outside and my little situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely going to be talking about
mold today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, thank you everyone for this
little intro, a little icebreaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought now we could kind of pivot
towards the topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, uh, this episode, like I'll be
pretty light touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to get you guys started,
but you know, I think feel free to start
[SPEAKER_03]: asking each other questions as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I'll prod you along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so again, today we're talking about
transitioning to flower and, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and really all of flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so maybe if we think about it from
like a chronological point of view,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, you know, you're at the end of veg,
you're aware that like things are about to
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons about to turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where does your mind go first in terms
of like what you're concerned about or
[SPEAKER_03]: what you might need to prepare,
you know, at this like late, maybe at the
[SPEAKER_03]: point of like late veg, early stretch,
um, can go back to little help decide us
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like into July, moving into
August, your, your plants have been out
[SPEAKER_00]: for a month or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, by that point, you know, if you're,
if you're planning like early June,
[SPEAKER_00]: give or take, um, so, I mean, just the way
I grow, I don't really think too much
[SPEAKER_00]: about nutrition because it's all in the
soil that I mixed in, in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, at least I shouldn't have to think
about nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if something's out of whack or
something and in which case, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but um, before that stretch happens,
um, if you're using trellis netting for
[SPEAKER_00]: support, um, you got, you got to get it on
early so that the plants can kind of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: through it, you know, as they begin to
really, I mean, they just explode in
[SPEAKER_00]: August between, you know, August 1st and
August 31st, like the amount of growth you
[SPEAKER_00]: get is, is, is, it's the most growth
you're going to see in the whole season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you got to have your support ready
so the plant can grow through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, or you're going to break stems
and it's just a hassle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that goes for any type of support,
whether it's like a fence, a fence or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, a cage, um, or, or trellis
netting or, or whatever it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bamboo stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd say that's the, that's the one
thing you need to, you need to get on if
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't done it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, other than that, like if you want to
boost them with nutrients and capture as
[SPEAKER_00]: much growth as you can, you can maybe
supplement with a little extra,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, nitrogen to really capture all that
stretch and get all that size you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll eat it up, um, if you give it to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point, like back off and,
and, and give them maybe a boost of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus towards the end.
August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm, I'm, I'm a big proponent of
giving, if, if your liquid feeding is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is high phosphorus early, early on in
flower, if not before right before flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, and then backing off and it's
transitioning to something higher in
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium, um, middle, middle of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just from everything I've learned and
been told and seen, that's, that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: you, that's how you crank them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but many years I, I won't feed
anything and I'll just adjust my soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mixes the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I feel it needs a different mixture,
um, everything's in the soil and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: try and make it available with teas and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I mean, yeah, that's,
that's August.
[SPEAKER_00]: The days are super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, making sure they're getting
watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're going to be at peak water
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm sure one thing I did want to ask
you, and this is kind of like even from
[SPEAKER_03]: your episode with Matt, that I was like
really curious about what is like a
[SPEAKER_03]: typical day for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like, you know, what time do you get
up and like, you know, what is the shape
[SPEAKER_03]: of a day and is, does that change much?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, in August, like we're
talking outdoor, but like I've got debt
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses being harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, usually maybe harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like in the middle of a depth
harvest, um, early, early August or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or at the tail end of it, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so like if we're still pulling tarps,
um, it's day starts at seven with pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: tarps, um, seven AM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's a great time to start
working because it's nice and cool
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so unless we're doing like harvesting,
which might happen all day, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we, we, we work from like seven to,
to lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we'll, we'll get in a good
chunk of work in the, in the, so those
[SPEAKER_00]: morning hours and then, um, quit,
quit at lunch, take a long lunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a break in the middle of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause unless there's stuff that absolutely
needs to happen, or it can happen indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's just, it's just so hot that
like, you're just going to be spinning
[SPEAKER_00]: your wheels and it's hard to do that every
day to, to work through, through.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do on that lunch break?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a nap or like, if I need a
nap, I'll take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, do something inside, like with
legalization, I have shit to do on the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, sometimes people run to the
river and, and go and just go to the river
[SPEAKER_00]: for three, four hours in the middle of the
day, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's really refreshing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, just regular household chores,
like doing laundry and shit like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like it's a, it's a good time in the
middle of the day to like, take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: your own personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, besides like eating or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, you know, you'd want to be
inside or in the shade and, and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if we have to work through the
heat, we will, but, um, if you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to, and you can come back at, like three
or four o'clock and work for another three
[SPEAKER_00]: hours or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, I just think it's way
more efficient, um, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for it's a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not a sprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta like not wear yourself out
and, uh, keep it sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sometimes there's indoor,
maybe you got bucking to do inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's all air conditioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's not as bad, but, uh,
or whatever the case may be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, um, yeah, I would say that's sort
of a typical day now on a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a harvest day, you know,
we'll just, we'll probably work and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: just take an hour lunch and just work
through it just to get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it just depends on kind of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is any need to rush or anything
like that, or, or whatever the case may
[SPEAKER_00]: be, but you know, um, a lot of days I've
got to leave the farm and, and go to town
[SPEAKER_00]: and do logistics and get supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so far out that that takes all
day, um, to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other times, like maybe I'm running
product to town, to distribution or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or picking up or, or whatever the case may
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, it could, it,
it, it varies a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other days is just, uh, like do a
morning walkthrough, which is my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And figure out like your priorities for
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is there a big transplanting that
needs to be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is there anything that needs that is
immediate need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the something in the water system
need to get fixed, you know, or plants
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to get watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be like a higher priority thing
that needs to get fixed right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I mean, it's, it's farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I could be a plumber one day and
electrician the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one day I might actually
get to like 10 to my plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's always kind of like what needs
to happen first, you know, and then like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's nothing else like crazy going
on or nothing broke, then you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: like tend to your plants and, and,
and do that, that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm glad to hear about this because I
think sometimes we get into these,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, uh, you know, more technical
discussions and it's easy to lose sight
[SPEAKER_03]: of, uh, the more human side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what it's like to work on this
stuff throughout the day and like what
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like to deal with human stuff and
life stuff alongside at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so sorry, not, I'm going off my own
script really, but I, I did, that was,
[SPEAKER_03]: that was cool to hear about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Kush, how about you, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, where do your thoughts go?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say transition to flower,
um, you know, just initially, and then
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe you could tell us a bit about what a
typical day looks like for you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my thoughts are when I, so August 1st,
generally everybody's thinking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stretch is either in full swing
or your plants are starting to push,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, push stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see them, see them doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's, uh, the first thing I'm
looking at is do I put up a second cage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I always internal cage my plants
because if I don't, um, with like two or
[SPEAKER_01]: four inch, um, cage fencing with,
with big, big squares in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if I don't, my plants get eaten
alive by deer that they will get chomped
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way down to the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so, so when I'm looking at that
stretch phase about to happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the plants that are going
to grow out and wider than those 65 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to need that external arm
structure, cause their natural inclinity
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be to go out and up and having
that second dairy cage out for the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't have their own vigor to hold up
their weight at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cage makes things so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and there are some telltale signs
and in structure and in branch vigor that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can tell if a plant is going to need
that, that secondary set of support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and once, uh, once stretch is in and
it's either going into one or two of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cages, my main goal is training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, what I like to do is,
uh, the branches natural inclinity will be
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick a square of the cage to go
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'll do is I'll work it either
one or two rungs lower than the hole that
[SPEAKER_01]: that branch wants to stick out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that keeps everything down and
separated and allows for more
[SPEAKER_01]: breathability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I do get a little bit of
rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, I deal with 20 to 30 mile an hour
winds on a, on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least once a week, I get an updraft up
the mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so with the cages, there's some
downsides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a little bit of rubbish and
anytime you have necrotic or dead
[SPEAKER_01]: material, it could promote mold under the
right, right conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the cages, it's a, it's a must
have for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried the trestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just, I've been complacent with
what's worked for me in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, right after stretch,
I'm not thinking about food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm practically just add water.
[SPEAKER_01]: My soil has all my pre-amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, uh, if I see the ladies asking for
a little more nitrogen, I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I brew a tea and I reactivate what's in
the soil and make it more readily
[SPEAKER_01]: available for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so transitionally for me,
I'm not thinking about anything different
[SPEAKER_01]: with food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still just, I'm still just adding
water and playing, playing water truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think right around that time,
I'm also, and you guys have seen this,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you, you check out my G is I'm
balancing my, uh, my cropping method
[SPEAKER_01]: between rocks and hay and trying to get a
decent medium to where the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: drinking the salt, the water out of the
pots at, at a, at a rate where they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: being evaporated out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually end, end of July.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through August and the start of September
is when my plants are drinking the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to, if I don't get out there and
water them before like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like nine or 10 AM, they're going to,
I'm going to notice the little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: droop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to notice them saying,
Hey man, I'm, I'm fucking thirsty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where's, where's my water at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, and, and that changes drastically
too, as we, as we move on further into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower to where, I mean, I'll have plants
that won't drink for three to five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if we have a heavy rainstorm,
it feels like even longer than that
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm paying it right after stretch is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying attention to the water
retention, how much the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause I, I hand water everything each,
each, each pod is, is hand watered with a
[SPEAKER_01]: hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I adjust a little bit here and
there to what, to what everybody's asking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in terms of like a typical day for
you, what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, early morning, um, it's two,
it's a, it's a two day visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't grow at where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to drive to the property where I
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have a separate piece of property
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was tedious at first, but the more I,
the more I weigh the benefits of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, I actually prefer doing it
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my indoor stuff I do at my house,
but, uh, it, um, it's, it's one visit in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes like, uh, when I know that
there's work that needs to be done,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a visit in the evening,
usually two to two, three, four hour
[SPEAKER_01]: visits in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, spent time just, you know,
it just, just like little hill said,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it's, it's very subjective when I walk
and when I, when I take that quarter mile
[SPEAKER_01]: walk and a quarter mile, it's like eighth
of a mile walk down through the valley and
[SPEAKER_01]: into my little jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I do is I look at the
plants and say, all right, who needs help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who needs what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's a general assessment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an open ended question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I walk into my little,
my little patch down in the valley,
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that image a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could take the quad down sometimes,
but like, I like walking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it's kind of like, uh,
intuition from hunting my whole life,
[SPEAKER_01]: like looking at track and seeing what's
been walking through what deer,
[SPEAKER_01]: what bear been coming through,
like getting boots on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, yeah, it's like a ritual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very ritualistic, very, very,
uh, meditative each morning, walking down,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just spending time with the plants,
but the journey that it takes to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, that's a little bit of a remote
hike.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Maddy booze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get jealous as fuck looking to push his
feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this path and it looks like there's a
river and shit serene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like three steps out my back door to
the shitty little plastic green house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get into my current
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, not what's ideal for me, because
obviously like my biggest concern right
[SPEAKER_02]: now is just running numbers and looking
for, for decent clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm cropping is just whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've got a daytime job, like ideally
one day I'd like to be able to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating whatever, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, legality is the way they are,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, like I grow everything in
fucking 10 or 15 gallons or maybe even
[SPEAKER_02]: fives.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm trying to like cram a few extra
plants in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start everything off in small
pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, almost let them get root bound a
little bit with the more sativa stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: then just transplant them into like a two
gallon to start off with until I can see
[SPEAKER_02]: sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, I can't really be putting
in real estate like three or four into a
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 gallon and get two dudes or three
dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sex and everything first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I'll transplant to my big
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got 15 gallon, 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I don't really have a set method,
like, uh, deviate between using like
[SPEAKER_02]: bagged soil that I'll add amendments and
stuff to what is making my own shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they get into making compost and stuff
like that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really when the flowering starts,
I'm just going to make sure that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: ain't going to stretch out of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so when I was growing outdoors,
so not in the greenhouse, just in the open
[SPEAKER_02]: air, it wasn't as much of a concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much just transplant shit to the
beds that, you know, a couple of nodes and
[SPEAKER_02]: then just let it stretch out and sort of
have fun with it from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, at the moment I,
I grow multiple plants in single
[SPEAKER_02]: containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sometimes, uh, can, can lead to some
pretty shitty results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, something will be under watered and
over watered, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from the same, uh, same packet
of seeds, it ends up like not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, man, that's the ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the current situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, um, yeah, a day for me,
uh, just getting up my indoor shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause it's so hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much run indoors just at
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'll get up at, you know,
five sometimes when the lights are still
[SPEAKER_02]: on, get in there, feed whatever needs to
be fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then get outdoors and I love being
out there in the early morning or at
[SPEAKER_02]: night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got like in my rental,
I've got fuck all fences and I back onto
[SPEAKER_02]: like a nature reserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like hiking trails and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So often I've been out there at like nine
or 10 at night doing foliar and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wow, it's when, you know, people can't
see me or just like bringing plants in and
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the greenhouse for pruning or this,
that, and the other, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, I don't have as big of a sit
just the boys, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a big part of my day growing
in soil as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I can go like a day or two
without even going in there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I know nothing needs to be watered
and, and that, but yeah, man, that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's mostly it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so each of you actually touched on
like, you know, different aspects of
[SPEAKER_03]: growing and do you have any questions for
each other?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like regarding what you just heard,
like, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: if not, you know, one thing I'd maybe
extend to you all, um, is like in general
[SPEAKER_03]: with flowering, you know, what do you,
what do you like the most about this
[SPEAKER_03]: entire stage relative to, you know,
vegetation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I, I got one for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, once the plants have resin,
they have smells, you know, so you can say
[SPEAKER_03]: what that's when you start becoming like
increasingly obsessed with them,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least for me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you, when you're growing
from seed or you're growing a new strain
[SPEAKER_00]: or something that you don't know quite
what it's going to smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and smell does change over time
as it develops, but like, for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, like you can start getting a picture
of what that plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once it gets a little bit of resin and
the first resin is usually on those pre
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll rub pre flowers, you know,
waiting for, to get some type of smell
[SPEAKER_00]: that isn't just, um, chlorophyll or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's, I mean, that's,
that's, I like, I like that the most about
[SPEAKER_00]: them to starting to develop flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, is, is you get to smell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, that's a huge part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I follow my nose, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: My nose has gotten me gotten, gotten more
things right than it's gotten wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the first bit of identity that
really stands out amongst these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: post veg is that that first bit of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's structure, but I mean,
when you first get that introduction of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the compound and you start either
relating it to other plants or you relate
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the, the parents of the hybrid or,
or, uh, you know, you, you just get a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get an identity for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that to me is like, that's one
of my favorite parts of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the magic of growing these
plants is that it's at that point where
[SPEAKER_03]: they stop becoming, sorry, where they're,
they're no longer as much of a black box
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're actually starting to see like
what they've got to offer you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, these are the puzzle to come together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause with a rose, like I've got,
I've got a bunch of roses.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when a new rose pops up,
I always stick my nose in and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nice thing to start the day,
but it's always the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why with flowering plants,
man, it's just a mystery every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reveals itself a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even like the structure of the flower,
if you'll grow a packet of seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll start to see that diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing's stopping the stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to throw out some reasonable
size fucking puff balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, oh shit, this thing ain't even
ticked over yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still stretching.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's barely even thrown pistol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's like, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just every day they seem to change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said before, like, I,
I don't think I've encountered another
[SPEAKER_01]: plant or any organic species that carries
as many smell profiles, like in one single
[SPEAKER_01]: species, it has an almost uncountable
amount of compounds that, and not only
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but a lot of those compounds are
subjective to each individual person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so when, and that was something that
at the party, man, we're passing around
[SPEAKER_01]: jars and people are picking up different
notes out of the same jar and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: finding similarities, but we're also
defining them by completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I don't know, I've never ran into
something so complex for the olfactory
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just adds to the reason why I think
some of us love it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring people down into the garden and
I'll be like, man, I smell, I smell
[SPEAKER_01]: menthol and blueberries and, and all this
complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people will just go, man,
I just smell weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, well then our noses
are different, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, I can hand Brynn like straight up
blueberry bud and have her smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she'll say, Ooh, peppery.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people just smell things
totally different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, that, that actually leads me to
want to ask you guys another question,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is like, and again, this is more on
the human side of things, but how many
[SPEAKER_03]: people do you get to share this with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how many people in your lives get to
witness, you know, what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be more tight-lipped about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all my friends, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, I keep a pretty low profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have like too many people in my
circle or whatever, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_02]: my friends haven't had exposure to this
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like my one buddy that came to
Amsterdam with me, that was his first time
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing anything except like, you know,
compact bullshit, the PGR, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the brick sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was his first exposure to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so every time I bring something new,
he's just stoked man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for most people that, you know,
you're showing them shit that they've
[SPEAKER_02]: never even seen or smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll, I love variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm not really cropping the
same clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time it's something new and you
know, friends will get a couple of bags of
[SPEAKER_02]: different seed plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a trip and I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it when you can get that
correlation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you smell something, I'll like
with my missus, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll always give her a bag and be like,
what do you smell?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if she, you know, says the same thing
as me, it's always like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you confirm and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep hearing a boost about PGR and I
feel like it's, it's, it's so it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's like a, it's a pretty good issue
down in Australia right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's less now less of a concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not really for the medical
market, but one thing that actually the
[SPEAKER_02]: good that's come of it is people are
getting all this stuff from the chemists
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So less people are having to go to the
streets to get weed, but man for the
[SPEAKER_02]: longest time, like I don't know if it was
a clone that was passed around like all of
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the theory was most of it was grown
by like Vietnamese gangs, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a lot of it come from like,
um, biker sort of circles as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure where it was being
cultivated, but yeah, man, it was a trip
[SPEAKER_02]: like 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd find the same weed, like the same
smell, same look, same like shitty effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was just grown with these
blood blasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like every device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing cannabis market goes through
that phase for a while where you get maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: like the less scrupulous growers,
um, who are really just in it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: money, uh, kind of blowing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, of course they, they PGR the
shit out of everything so they can yield
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it's the quality is so
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the market sort of like we had
Canada doing that and that all came down
[SPEAKER_00]: this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people were doing it here in
probably the early two thousands into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of like the market got,
well, for one, you have like, you did have
[SPEAKER_00]: like the regulated market testing for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you started having medical
dispensaries testing for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of helped, but like also the
market just realized that look with less
[SPEAKER_00]: resin, but a huge bud, super dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that great a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it looked better than the Mexican
brick they were getting before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's people just realized it wasn't
that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it started to not have the value for
the people doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like every market's kind of
gone through that PGR phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't know, I just,
it's just interesting to hear it down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I think that's an interesting
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that it's like,
um, almost like a stepping stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: For every developing market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that people are like
apathetic towards it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know people that actually like
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people that will still buy it week in
week out just because of the price because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the availability or it's what they're
used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause most people are like, it's the only
weed they've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So depressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can show them some of yours and
probably blow their mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, man, sometimes it's,
yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people just get, get used to that
sort of effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Micro butanol, whatever's going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a side note.
[SPEAKER_03]: We showed it to, I, we showed a picture to
Matt on the, uh, cannabis around the world
[SPEAKER_03]: episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was pretty funny, trying to
describe what it looks like little hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like, you know how when nugs,
like when it's grown super bad,
[SPEAKER_04]: like it's all nothing but hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like that, but even worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a Jim Henson puppet,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the bee sters we used to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super PGR.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to, maybe in the private chat,
I can find, uh, I'll find a picture for
[SPEAKER_03]: you little hill later on, like,
um, as we go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was certainly stages of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I was getting some,
at some stage that was like little hill
[SPEAKER_02]: talks about just big old chunks,
like half ounce fucking buds, big compact
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were less hairy, but still they were
like gray, like fuck all resin glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, yeah, there was like,
sometimes people would come around with
[SPEAKER_02]: the stuff that was full on like,
yeah, little dingleberries, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: like little stamped on, you know,
hairy fucking red and gray balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm putting a link in the chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, that's not a link.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a link.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll, I'll try to get that to you at
some point in this chat, but Chris,
[SPEAKER_03]: did you do anything to add on the PGR
note?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, no, I don't have anything to add
onto that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cause the other thing I want to ask
you guys again, broadly, before we start,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I'm going to start prompting y'all to
kind of start drilling into like mold and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, but before we get there,
and it's probably a natural segue to mold,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what are the things that y'all dislike
about the stage or like, what do you,
[SPEAKER_03]: what concerns you or worries you,
or, you know, what are the downsides for
[SPEAKER_03]: you when you're getting into flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, downsides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that there are any,
um, maybe downsides is a bad term,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like, what things do you start to
worry about maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I want to encourage it,
but I know it's going to stank like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I got a neighbor like two meters
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't have those concerns
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm, I'm sort of like wrapped up in
depth harvest and that, and that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: takes priority and attention, um,
from things going on in the other garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as like work load and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, back in the day, just the same
shit, like I still wasn't worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, but I mean, helicopters and,
and what's going on, um, up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they usually do bus in like,
um, late July, August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so sort of just like where they are
that day, where, where the, whatever the,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the task force or whoever it is
rolling around the convoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, on the roads, uh, other than that,
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just, everything's fixing to
get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I know, I know later on in
flower, like when you get into like mid to
[SPEAKER_00]: late September, um, and everything's too
early to chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, you're just like hanging
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost nothing to do on the plants
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hitting your watering,
but like, there's enough on the vine to
[SPEAKER_00]: like, for thieves to come and they'll
still, they'll still take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you can't shop for like
another three weeks, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing else you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, in September, you've got
all this, like, I almost feel like there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always needed a September project to do
something, to take up my time or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: to take up the cruise time because like
there was really nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depth's already down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out the door, um, you can't start
harvesting yet, but you know, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: this huge workload ahead, but you can't,
you can't get started early on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kind of nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deal with the paranoia and just,
and just maybe do it, do a September
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've done things over the years,
like build a tree house or, or,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, maybe work on a new space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're expanding the next year or
working on a fence or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, um, that's, that's, that's how I
kind of take up that extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, for you, I guess one of the
problems is also just thinking what you
[SPEAKER_03]: would do with that free time when you have
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, that's, um, are you guys lolly
popping and shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are you stripping a lot of the
lowers off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely lower branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I don't, I don't lolly pop a whole
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it, it, it, it, that the time it
takes is enormous at this scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I don't feel like I'm not totally
convinced in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very strange to strain for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I'm not totally convinced how much
it helps outdoors because I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the sun moves over the sky,
you know, and hits the plants from both
[SPEAKER_00]: sides, um, over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those smaller buds at the bottom,
like I can sell those too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if they're dense at all, like they're
still, they're still worth something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, as long as the bottom branches
aren't laying in the soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trim those up, um, make sure they're not
in the way of like, if I'm using sprayers,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure nothing's in the way of the
spray or spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, over the circumference of the
pot, but lolly popping just takes a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do do leafing, um, in, in my depth
greenhouses and just to defoil late as
[SPEAKER_00]: they call it now, but I just call it
leafing or big leafing, um, just to,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get better light penetration on
certain strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, nah, not a whole lot of lolly
popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not lolly popping either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the most growth cleanup that I'll do
is if I'm looking through the internal
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of a plant and I can't like
stick my hand through it without like it
[SPEAKER_01]: turning into a jungle or hitting every
branch and leaf on the way in,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'm going to do a little bit of
cleaning up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if she's breathing just fine,
like if a big gust of wind comes through
[SPEAKER_01]: and I could see that it exchanges air on
every node all the way up, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, I'm not going to clean off any of the
inner growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to take what people call the
suckers or those little branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'll leave all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can, if I can see a plant choking
itself out, if I can see like actual fan
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves, like decaying on the internal
growth because of partial cannibalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also a complete lack of sunshine,
then I'll clean up some of that inner
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, the cream bag seed that I popped
this year had some inbred mutant stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: going on and she had some internal jungly
growth that no matter how much I trained
[SPEAKER_01]: her outwards, there was still internal
growth that was in shade almost all,
[SPEAKER_01]: all day, all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's strain strain dependent on
whether or not if I'm doing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning up on the, uh, on the fan leaves
or the internal growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just open up the center of the plant
similar to like cherry tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like you said, as long as I've
got, I don't know if I've got four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: like main colors, as long as there's a
nice gap in the center where air can sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of move around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cool with that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the breathability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't grow something like I've seen
pictures of Urkel and like deep chunk and
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble where they grow like a ball leaves
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't grow something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mostly like the long flower and shit in
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top your deep chunk plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those varieties you just named are
notorious for having just tons of nodes
[SPEAKER_00]: and tons of larv on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not growing anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, besides maybe some pool nuts,
which is kind of similar, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, if that was the case, yeah,
I'd have to rethink it because they've
[SPEAKER_00]: just got, you know, a node every,
you know, inch or so on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just so much extra foliage and
they larv up so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that much extra is
definitely going to rob from your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your top buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you know, when, when your nodes
are further apart, it, man, I just look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it as like, there's a whole smalls market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, everything that's not big enough to go
in your bag of like a buds goes in the B
[SPEAKER_00]: buds or smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, there's, you know, they're easy
to machine trim and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them for you, sell them for less,
but you can still sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and your machine trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not really paying a trimming
costs like, like you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I just look at it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was still Matt over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 2004, whatever in Cali,
like a little old guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all those tiny little buds on the
bottom of the stand, click that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good era to be in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it'd be nice, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we kind of got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we were talking about like,
uh, light and air penetration and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's talk about PM mold, but try
this, you know, all those things get into
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'm, I'm guessing me and,
and thousand fuller kind of in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: boat where we have pretty dry,
dry climates and good wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I've got pretty good wind at my spot
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you mean Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and like, it's pretty constant,
you know, uh, medium to heavy wind and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, I mean, that's great for all
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know people closer to the coast,
um, do do a bit more lollipopping and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning in the inside of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really get PM outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, something about the UV from
the sun really suppresses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will see later on in the season,
um, on the north side of a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might see some PM starting,
but by that point you've, you've usually
[SPEAKER_00]: already started harvest and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just see it forming on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to do anything else with
at that point, besides chop it down and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe chop it up or burn it or whatever
you do with your stems, um, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see PM and, and, and, and it's just
part of our routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're foiler feeding with minerals or,
or, uh, you know, some type of like zine
[SPEAKER_00]: product or phosphorus product,
um, that usually suppresses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good for me, um, without like
specifically spraying for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I found over the year to sprain
anything helps with PM honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, I don't know something about
the UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think really, really does that work for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never, and like I said, we're not
that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're basically just on the opposite side
of the valleys of each other with very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar, similar locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I, the only thing that's the only
time I've ever had to deal with PM was
[SPEAKER_01]: because nearby, uh, wisteria bushes were
like over hydrated and we're just dripping
[SPEAKER_01]: water on, on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had they not been overhung by them,
then there wouldn't have been any PM to be
[SPEAKER_01]: created on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it, I, I've always described my area
as like almost desert high, high desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a very arid, very dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very windy until it's not like the
second mid September hits, it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes, it's, it's almost always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a rainstorm, there's a day
where it's an inch of rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my little, my little side of the
mountain up here, we have a perfect little
[SPEAKER_01]: storm of that Southern, the Southern cold
winds blowing up the valley mixing or the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the hot Southern winds blowing up the
valley, mixing in with the cold air that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes down off the foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I live right at that congruence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it makes for amazing thunderstorms and
62nd, 120 second long rolling thunder,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also brings with it some crazy
storms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, PM is not something that I
battle with, uh, generally, but the mold
[SPEAKER_01]: when, when I'm start getting those days
where, you know, plants have absorbed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, an inch of rain over like a six
hour, eight hour, 12 hour period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I'm, I'm going out the next
day and I'm shaking down every plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get as much moisture off of them
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause I, cause I know what's going to
come if you leave enough moisture and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I'm no expert in dealing with gray
mold or, or boisterous, but from my
[SPEAKER_01]: observations, I notice it grows best and
initially off of necrotic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is a dead plant cell,
even if it's tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the right moisture with the right,
um, lack of, of UV contact, it seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: just create itself instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then the last couple of years,
I've tried changing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I notice, um, when I'm defoliating,
uh, dead cannibalized fan leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: normally I'll just hand pluck them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll grab it by the leaf and I'll just rip
down or I'll rip up and I'll pluck it
[SPEAKER_01]: right off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll come back, uh, in late
flower and that exact node where I plucked
[SPEAKER_01]: off that family is right where the
boisterous, the gray mold has started is
[SPEAKER_01]: where, where I plucked that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two years ago, instead of hand
plucking, I started taking the scissors
[SPEAKER_01]: and just snipping the end of those,
those leaf, uh, branches off and stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: plucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that those boisterous,
the gray mold areas where it would
[SPEAKER_01]: normally be attacked, where there was dead
necrotic material, it wasn't happening
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly as often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing or at least observing what I've
seen in my garden, um, how it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it likes to attack the necrotic and dead
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've, it's changed how I defoliate,
um, my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's, that's right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've noticed similar stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, yeah, it does like those dead
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a dead bud leaf or a,
or a parched one, devoid of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it'll like to start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I don't do a whole lot for mold
besides try and grow strains that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to mold before they finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, like strains like sour
diesel don't mold, but they go so late
[SPEAKER_00]: that I feel like they can't finish very
well where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to run something past
Halloween or even up to Halloween,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, October 31st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just too late for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually every day, every night for them
really to finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they don't mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, they go through storms and
they just don't fricking mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I, I've never had a big mold
problem up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always ran strains that finish up
before the mold is going to come in before
[SPEAKER_00]: the, before that next storm comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like clockwork every year we get
a storm in late September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, and it's too early for,
for mold to really set in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it washes the plants off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like it, honestly, it keeps the
dust down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, you know, it makes everything smell
fresh and new and it really feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest time when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, generally I take all my tops
first anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once the fat second growth is,
it's not those fat colas, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, they don't, they're not going to
mold up as easy, but, um, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this year we're getting a ton of rain
for September and October more than
[SPEAKER_00]: normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I'm running all new strains that I
don't know what they do or how they
[SPEAKER_00]: perform or even when they were going to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have seen more mold than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's a combination of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running strains that aren't tried and true
and more rain than usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had, yeah, I mean, we've had more
rain already in October than probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: last, you know, two, three years combined,
honestly, at least for the first half of
[SPEAKER_00]: October.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I kind of already decided
what I didn't want to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was a lot of those super,
super center, big giant center Cola fat
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, but kind of just like meh on the
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: From compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those things are bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are bred, you know,
indoors in salts, you know, with probably
[SPEAKER_00]: with led lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not like that kind of
breeding constantly is just taking
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics a certain way where even though a
lot of our genetics are, we're bred
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like you do another selection
when you move outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you figure out, okay, this is what
I like, but let's see what works for me in
[SPEAKER_00]: this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do selections off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might do breeding off of that other
breeders up here, especially like 707 seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's really bred for like NorCal
outdoor, um, climate and a lot of his
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, um, do well, do well in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing a lot of his strains,
but like, I know he's done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, I do my selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I'd rather run, run a bunch of
clones and figure out which ones work for
[SPEAKER_00]: me and which ones don't and just select,
select, you know, clones that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely want us to return to
particular plants or individual lines or
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals that, um, have and have not
done well for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but maybe we'll let booze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk finish first about, um, whether he
has to deal with PM and mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not PM and I, I may be off base,
but I think PM is more of like a cooler
[SPEAKER_02]: climate thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like cool temperament coast or cause
I'm in the subtropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have those cool nights in
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've ever seen PM on
cannabis, except perhaps once when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: growing a cucumber in the same bed,
which I just want to make that mistake
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, as long as you're in veg,
super fucking easy to deal with just like
[SPEAKER_02]: lactobacillus or even like a milk spray or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, boitress is a big,
big concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the photo that's in my little DP,
that was that year that we had monsoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the weather has just fucked man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally we can assume that in March,
um, which is, I guess your September,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, we're going to have say like autumn,
you know, we're going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it always rains at Easter time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but this year was particularly bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had roughly 95% humidity and just
torrential downpours for like two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, two thirds of the way through
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, big fucking hand grenade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like in that picture there,
there's a massive tarp over that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was out there most days,
or even when it was raining really bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sort of standing under there with
like a broom every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just fucking pushed the tarp up man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucked like never seen rain like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had thousands of houses destroyed
floods and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that, it was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost like a half a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like, you know, a 10th of that
crop went to malt in the bin and the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of it made it through, which was good,
but that was the genetics too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like that sweet skunk,
uh, S one crossed the diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, um, yeah, it was good for the,
for the conditions, but yeah, I've,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, one mistake that I'd made,
I always assume that our climate was the
[SPEAKER_02]: same as California, but you guys don't get
a lot of rain in summer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly like wintertime or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a, we're a Mediterranean climate
here in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really all of California,
which is a West coast phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you guys do have a
Mediterranean climate in Perth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like that's, you know,
the only places that happens is wet on
[SPEAKER_00]: West coast, like West coast of South
America around Chile, um, Perth,
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, and then I forget where in
Africa they get it, but Africa has that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then obviously the Mediterranean area up
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, that means warm,
warm, dry summers, and then mild winters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where could we have a similar climate
to in the States, like Oregon or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they get a lot of rain in the
summertime or still not really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they don't have, they,
they don't, I mean, maybe even further
[SPEAKER_00]: North, um, you might be more like an East
coast climate because they get,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a lot of humidity and then they
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity just builds and builds and
builds, and then they get a thunderstorm
[SPEAKER_02]: like Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably even more like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never lived out there, so I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're, if you're humid and,
and, and get a lot of rain in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summer, like I think that's more of
like an East coast type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be rough at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some years we'll get a good year,
but yeah, I mostly prefer like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start my shit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll love to have things finishing
around the May period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously for you guys, it's too late
snowing and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: By then, but I, if I can stretch it,
so starting things off, say like November,
[SPEAKER_02]: December, instead of like September,
it gives me just an extra few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm flowering when it's a little bit
drier and cooler and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in the greenhouse.
Wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would your May be equivalent to
for them in terms of months?
[SPEAKER_02]: One before June.
[SPEAKER_02]: So May is like November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like the beginning of winter
really for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, cause when I was buying seeds
initially, I do a few packs of stuff from
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a old Betsy cross to the push
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to them,
but I was, I've seen those grown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's good stuff in there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got two packs, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some that's, that's on top of the list for
when I get the new spots sorted.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some Betsy cross to Appy from
high loans from as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I got some of that sitting in
front of me right now, cured and ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke down right after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn smell of vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pine citrus, a little bit of mango,
not heavy mango and like a little cream,
[SPEAKER_01]: little creaminess in it, but lots of pine
and lots of mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause yeah, that one sounds like it'd be a
mango bomb with the GC and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Betsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have done notoriously well in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the Cush cleaner as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I don't know, like tons of that's
been grown up here and it's just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the plants, the finishing
time, the look of the nuggets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield, the quality of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those are big, like popular
commercial producers up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking I'm going to get some skunk
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've seen, um, gray skull in Hawaii
with the skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that apparently seems to do really
well with humidity, similar thing to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they definitely have humidity out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a good thing to,
uh, to look for is like, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for the most part, they're
breeding outdoors out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like, I would assume most of them
are growing some type of depth or short
[SPEAKER_00]: season plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that would be, yeah, sourcing some
of their genetics, Joey weed, or is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it Joe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they might be indoors as well,
but I think, yeah, yeah, totally,
[SPEAKER_00]: totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That those would be good genetics to look
into for, for what might work well for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got, and dude, and their weed
out there is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got, I mean, you know,
just the quality of their, their growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and, and what they're doing out
there, especially those people is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, it's the highest quality pot
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even from the canon Bible, like HP 13 and
like the sour pea and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always looked really good stuff to get
something like that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I had some Molokai frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the TK man.
[SPEAKER_02]: A friend of mine grew from Ochi,
um, goat and monkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, yeah, reversed TK onto that
Molokai frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was some good smoke, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like, yeah, I wouldn't say it's
gunky, but like certainly like rotten
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you make your own scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I've, um, mostly just looking for
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got some advice early on,
like, you know, just get a bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: library going first, which, um,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will be, once I've got the space,
definitely like doing more preservations,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm doing my first little project at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a, I tried to reverse a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it's, um, thread cutter from CB.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a rubber city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem D Afghani cross to diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this one's pretty rank.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stacks rather hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a, it's pretty hardy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's been in the room of things that
have like got some might damage and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just chugs along.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, really rank knows super cerebral
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to reverse that onto a couple
of the sativas that I've got just to try
[SPEAKER_02]: and find a plant that'll throw down some
chunks outdoors and have some nice tank to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like my first little thing that
I'm doing, but never really made seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a perfect segue by the way,
cause I was going to prompt y'all to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about like, yeah, like I was saying
earlier, lines or individual plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: have typically done well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but also maybe you guys could talk
about individuals that did particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: poorly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, kind of already there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So open open to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kush, I noticed you grew some,
some train wreck hybrids this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I I've grown a few myself over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the biggest yielding plant I've
ever had is a train wreck to West coast
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the size of the colas weren't
that, I mean, they were as long as my arm
[SPEAKER_00]: just dense all the way, just the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see on the screen, but like the
length of my arm is like the cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it branches off and goes into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, by far the biggest yielding plants
I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the quality was just like,
man, it, it was like big, dense,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, West coast dog nugs, not quite as
dense as West coast dog with like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of train wreck smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it was that turpentine sort of
smell, um, super meds, but total mold
[SPEAKER_00]: bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, like molded up like nobody's
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown West coast dog out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it finishes early, so mold's not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it smells like hay, but it looks
beautiful in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's just matter of if you
can sell it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, um, that's, that's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown train wreck and I've grown,
uh, train wreck back crosses out here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'll do great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they really need a lot of support
though, cause they're basically rubber,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, rubber stemmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, yeah, they bend over and
twist like without, like, like five or
[SPEAKER_01]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they're just, yeah, you can be
that's, and I think that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, of all the train wreck stories,
I don't know what's true or what's not
[SPEAKER_00]: true, but like of all the train wreck
stories I've heard, um, the fact that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could grow a big plant outdoors and have
it just basically laying on the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like a mess, like a train wreck,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that's where it got its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you don't support those things
and way back in the day, like when train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck first came around, or at least first
got out there, that's like, you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: like late nineties and nobody was growing,
you know, 99 in full sun at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, you know, they're,
they're growing up, you know, under a tree
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere and like not, you know,
setting up cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trellis netting and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, those plants are looking
like absolute train wrecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're laying flat on the ground
without a broken stem on them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just laying, basically just laying on
the ground, growing like a, like a ground
[SPEAKER_00]: cover, I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it's got its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to agree out of all the names
that are the reasons I've heard the names,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like people pick the names and
all the wild shit people said,
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems really obvious to me that that's
probably the Genesis of at least that name
[SPEAKER_04]: for it, because it does look like a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's considered creeper style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you see Neville's old catalog and
he talks about the creeper phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's supposedly what that look is where
the apical bud grows like lower than the
[SPEAKER_04]: other buds, you know, just kind of like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, and that's kind of like that
mother shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so was talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also mentioned in the Canada Bible,
I never saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was always interested to see it just
cause of how it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That always held my a fascination too.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one knows what the train wreck is,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I spoke to Pac and he said he thinks
it has tie in it, but would anyone have
[SPEAKER_02]: any idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just a tie Afghan that someone kept?
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured if Caleb doesn't know,
then probably no one's going to really
[SPEAKER_04]: have a good grasp on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he's had it for so long and really
searched out the history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it predate, does it predate all of the
seed bank shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's from like the eighties,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are eighties.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we don't even know the tree
Genesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we know the, I mean,
the first I heard of it was probably
[SPEAKER_00]: around 99 or 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means even if it makes its way
down to the Bay area where I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: south of the Emerald triangle,
that's like the first named weed I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much different than what else
was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was, you know, there was still
good weed out there, but, um, so like if
[SPEAKER_00]: it took that long to get to me,
like when I'm like 17, 18 years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I'm guessing it, I guess it had been
around since at least the mid nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more likely before that, even just
before it, like it gets released or gets
[SPEAKER_00]: off of that Hill, wherever it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the, the turps on it,
like train wreck turps or Jack turps or
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine or whatever that may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, that's super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all those sort of like, like narrowly
varieties, maybe not so much the tie,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like definitely some of the Panama,
definitely some of the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like the look of it, I haven't
seen anything that, that looks quite like
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, those specifically the large
conical shaped buds, the way that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they perf, they're not triangular,
but they have cone, they're almost a cone
[SPEAKER_01]: shape at the base that goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, yeah, it's funny you mentioned
that because the, the out-crosses of train
[SPEAKER_01]: wreck that I see seem to get like a
giganticism, like when it, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the train wreck on its own, it has decent,
it has decent sized buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I saw it cross to Calio,
um, two years ago, and when I saw it cross
[SPEAKER_01]: to Salmon Creek big bud about five or six
years ago, that's that I grew,
[SPEAKER_01]: they both were soda can, like mad dog,
like 40 ounce soda can colas that were
[SPEAKER_01]: obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just, it seems that when,
when you, when you cross her out to
[SPEAKER_01]: something, she, she just takes off with
that, that genetic and you can see it in
[SPEAKER_01]: her.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it across multi, like the
second I popped that Calio to train wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: from CSI, I was looking at this and I was
like, man, my brain says train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the way these buds are
forming and.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, it, it just like to achieve
followed in with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I see those same things,
um, from packs ATW.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through CSI is hybrids and the S one
all the way over to what, um, what pack
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's the similarity of that
conical shaped, um, just like it has,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has that, that recognizable pattern to
it that I don't see in a lot of other
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any, like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sense that you guys associate with
something that will be more resistant PM
[SPEAKER_04]: PM or more resistant either or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, I think it's more like blood
structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so the one thing I did, I've seen hold
true so far is strawberry tends to like
[SPEAKER_04]: even stuff from herb beer herb beer is
known to be super, super, uh, molten PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: Resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it was built out in
Switzerland where it's really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really humid and it needs to finish fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, you know, all the way to
strawberry cough stuff, it breeds true
[SPEAKER_04]: for, uh, all sorts of PM and mold
resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always wondered if that was like,
because it carries so heavy with
[SPEAKER_04]: strawberry, if there were other sense that
may also kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't noticed anything set related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't, I can't make correlations
with, I can make correlations with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, peppery and, and, uh, with,
uh, really spicy plants that have,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've grown a couple of different ones
that smell like black ground pepper or
[SPEAKER_01]: white pepper, and they are almost
untouched by, by insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that, that girl scout cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Savage purple that you and Brian,
uh, Brian tried, um, that smelled like
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, when I microscoped it and when
I'm, I'm taking a closer look at it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing it a single bug,
no, no, uh, no exoskeletons, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no frass, you know, left behind for any
wings or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, they just don't, don't even
want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find something gopher proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've been fighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, I got these, this pole thing called
a gopher hawk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys ever seen this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's I'm battling these mothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're tearing my yard up and I want to
play and I can't dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so caddy shack right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that man is like quietly growing
outdoors, but no one really knows that
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I saw those cherry
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were growing some for the auto out
there or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even, I don't count my outdoor
because I suck it outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't count this as growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not my, it's not my specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning curves to everything,
especially in a brutal climate like
[SPEAKER_00]: Bakersfield, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've even just talking to little
Hills taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was trying to bring in the indoor
method to outdoor and just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course I'm going to put it in a five
gallon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck wouldn't I?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not like realistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're putting it out at the beginning
of the season in a five gallon pot and
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking you're going to get dank,
like, and I'm bottle feeding out,
[SPEAKER_04]: like there's so many things I'm doing
backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been a learning learning curve for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're trying to grow
anything, if you're putting in the black
[SPEAKER_00]: pot on cement or something, it's like,
it's 150 degrees at the root ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had them right next to us, a brick wall
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my neighbor couldn't see anything on
cement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was just cooking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's so many common sense things I
didn't take into account, but that aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: common sense for indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been so indoor centric for so
long, like none of it was checking out
[SPEAKER_04]: until like after a season of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going, Oh my God, it's such an
idiot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, most of this episode,
I'm just tuning in and listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I don't really have much of a place
to speak here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would plant late, honestly, um,
put, put them out at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: August in, and then pot them up into,
into whatever size you want them to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, if you veg them up in six
inch pots, you know, pot them up into like
[SPEAKER_00]: a 10 gallon in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, like it won't really get
root bound too bad or, or, or if it does
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, it'll be, you'll be well into
flower already because you want those
[SPEAKER_00]: roots to be able to stretch as they,
as the plant stretches, you want the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to stretch as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so not, not going too small on
pot size was also helps regulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and not having it on cement
or, or, uh, shading the pot with
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leading a board up or against up all
the pots or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but like, I like the lat, the late
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's no reason to get out at like,
you know, solstice or bright before
[SPEAKER_00]: solstice in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you, if you don't have to,
like back in the day when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow big plants up here, cause plant
numbers was such an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, you want to maximize all your
veg time and try and get 10 pounds on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on a plant, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, nowadays, like it's a misdemeanor
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put out a thousand if you were like,
you know, and you'll do fine or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's just so hard to keep it happy
that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if you're not going to go all
out and put it in a 300 gallon pot or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, then you might as
well just wait till later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you're going to get like the
quality or buds going to be way nicer than
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be off a 10 pound plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just throw a little half ounce plant
or excuse me, a half pound plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the case, whatever the case may
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm growing like smaller plants
in a, in my outdoor is, is, is one because
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a smaller stem and I want it to
look more like depth or more like indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also like, it just works perfectly
with my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're busy planning my greenhouses
and April and may, and then like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess even into June, we're still
planting greenhouses sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once those are planted,
then we can work on the outdoor crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: get the next wave of plants like cloned
and grown up and plant the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm in no rush to get in the
outdoor, like at the same time as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get into everything else,
because I got to get into my greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: early to pull off two crops and take
advantage of like the sort of season
[SPEAKER_00]: extension a greenhouse gives you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I just, once you lose sun,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it just works
perfectly into my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then I kind of get the best
of both worlds in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, just for me that that's
that works super well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I'm sure people that have
been growing like this a lot sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If plant numbers were never an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same reason I didn't go
super deep on my beds, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: six inches of potting soil with like
another three or four inches of amended
[SPEAKER_00]: native soil underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they don't, they don't need 18
inches of soil, of potting soil to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to stretch their roots out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they, they, they, they do fill those
beds out by the end of it, but I want
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe the roots will start going
deeper to find extra water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, that's all they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them to, well, I guess the
other side of this is a root bound plants
[SPEAKER_00]: going to trigger and start flowering
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that can be to your advantage,
but like usually, usually not because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're fighting this uphill battle
at that point to keep the plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: enough nutrients and watering it four
times a day or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more with like 114.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be drying that pot out super
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's just like manipulating
certain things to, to your advantage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not letting them be the variable that
really like ruins your season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, trying to grow up a full
term plant in a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you're going to be fighting
uphill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I see people, I mean, people,
you'd be surprised how many people do
[SPEAKER_00]: this, not really realize it thinking that
45 gallon pot they planted in June is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not like, unless you want to
feed it four times a day and, and have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pump it full of salts because you know,
there's, there's not enough nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have all these things
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had friends do this over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched them and it's like,
they never listened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then they go through one
season, you know, on their backyard grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they realized what I was talking
about, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't vet your plants out to six feet tall
in February and then put them out in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hundred gallon pot thinking you're
going to end up with a 50 pound plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up with a shitty ass
plant that grows ugly bud because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants sick the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be better off waiting till June and
put out like a one foot tall plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that you've edged for a month or
whatever, or maybe less and you'll end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with more and it'll be better weed at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to play mostly the game.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I have a Snoopy neighbor and like,
I wanted to be able to move the plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, move, keep them moving
essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So wherever it like, cause he likes to get
up on ladders and look or just be a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like to keep them moving and you
can't really do that in smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was trying to play the indoor game of
being stealth outdoor when realistically
[SPEAKER_04]: just the smells in the morning alone,
like ruin all stealth for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you got them vegged out all
summer, like that's more time for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: for him to see him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if it's like one, like there's
nothing until August and then all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden there's like a little screen over
your patio or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're going to flower out and
you're going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to, you know, they're going
to be done by, by then, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard of a guy, I've never seen it
myself, but he told me about it a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would root a clone upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the branch, you know how the
branches want to come up like this off the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he would root it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he could, so it would come like this
and he could bend it horizontally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rooted upside down and then it's
easier to bend those branches and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: going horizontally along a fence and keep
them low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to bend them, you know, that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have them split.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did the roots grow that way?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, did they try to grow down and around
the top of the plug when it was hanging?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he hang them upside down and have the
tray upside down to root them?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think he just turned the clone
upside down to root instead of rooting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, like he didn't have a top
on the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he just turned it upside down,
left a bunch of, a bunch of stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's hard to say left a bunch of
stem on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: To root that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, and then the branches were
already coming out this way, but then they
[SPEAKER_00]: easily go horizontal instead of a regular
plant with the branches like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then trying to bend them back down
where they'll split.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did all of that to trellis it along
a fence so his neighbors couldn't see.
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially what you're saying is like,
it's a normal growing plant like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He cuts the top off, cuts this off right
here, flips that bitch upside down and
[SPEAKER_04]: roots this part without the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots the top stem with the two branches
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two branches over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to, just to bend them horizontally
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, like it's, it's a novel idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out of the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that one, but I've heard
like all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my, um, mate's dad, who was like one
of my best mates and taught me growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he used to grow a lot of like
Southeast Asian sort of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing super crazy, but it was just,
he imported from, you know, seventies,
[SPEAKER_02]: eighties, nineties, because he's in his
sixties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then just the remnant seed,
they just, you know, pull seed out of each
[SPEAKER_02]: bud each year and just keep it in a,
in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was basically like some sort of OP,
but nothing too great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, because he had like pretty small
fences, he would do all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like layerage where you're getting like
branches and burying the branches in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground to get like more, um, more roots
and stuff on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're getting like more water.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd do the almost grow like a grape vine,
have like a single store and then just
[SPEAKER_02]: like grow it sideways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would have been advantageous doing
the clones like, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to a grape vine, you know,
you'll get like, it'll be three meters
[SPEAKER_02]: long and only like a meter tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's also a giant pumpkin,
uh, technique to grow your, grow your
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkin plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously you're chopping off
all the other pumpkins except your one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you bury the vine again to grow
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let it come back up so that
you've got this huge root system for this
[SPEAKER_00]: one pumpkin on this giant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the pump, the big pumpkin growers,
they have these plants that take up like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a thousand square feet or 2000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one pumpkin plant, but it's got vines
that have been continuously buried to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: roots and all that energy just ends up at
one growth site.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: CSI wants to jump in on the pumpkin
growing scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has he talked to you about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never talked to him about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to do some, some, some funny games
back in the day with, uh, guess how much
[SPEAKER_00]: this bed will weigh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, uh, the record just got broken
for, uh, for the giant pumpkin down in a
[SPEAKER_00]: half moon day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 2,700 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, uh, it's, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, it's, it's, and they're just,
it's just organic, like super pumping
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants, tons of microbes,
tons of rich earth, tons of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know what else they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure the guys have a lot of
tricks, but like that's, that's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them that, that is just super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gourd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that booze did gesture towards
that I wanted him to talk about a bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: is actually some of the NLD leaning stuff
that he likes to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell us a bit more about what you've
experienced so far with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's more of just the climatic
concern for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like, I appreciate the high more
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, um, when I was in Amsterdam,
that was mostly what I was buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the sativas and the various
Hayes crosses and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's my preference in terms of smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, it just happens to grow well
here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So generally, yeah, man, um, my best
success, I guess, is probably that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the death in Venice that I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the sweet skunk S1 across to
the diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that was that sort of super
turpinoline bombs, hazy effects that I
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, aside from that, man,
I'm, uh, working on getting into some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the more NLD stuff from white Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've got a shitload of packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're one of the people that I
distribute through the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got a shitload of packs from them,
just like seeds, man, Hayes across the
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian black, like a bunch of Nepalese
stuff, all sorts of different things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've done a few indoors, like I grew a
bandaid Hayes plant indoors and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, a Harlem dreams as well, which is like
a 11 weaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like blue dream crossed to a PIFS
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they did pretty well indoors,
but throwing them outdoors, man is you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: see that that's where they want to thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's some going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try and move into like doing
some outdoor breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't really hear about it too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the only time I've heard anyone sort
of talk about it is breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve said that he used to do like a
selection or two, like a round or two of
[SPEAKER_02]: selection outdoors and then bring them
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that I'm interested in
because like, um, little hill,
[SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned that shard has a lot of
outdoor breeding and obviously,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, mean gene as well as like outdoor
stuff, but are there a lot of breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding outdoor seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people are taking them indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is this a concern that indoor
growers have that people will breed?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do whatever you want with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of what growers are growing is
just, if you're an outdoor grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to make combined
outdoor plants that you think would go
[SPEAKER_00]: good together that work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if both mothers or both lines do well
outdoors, then Hey, put them together and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe something cool happened out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you want to take like one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like very hyped up, but it's like,
you know, whatever the market's like
[SPEAKER_00]: really wanting like a gelato or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least they were wanting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, and then, you know,
combining it with like blue dream or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever outdoor stranger running that,
that, that maybe breed good stuff for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like green crack or the Appalachia,
like those are just, those are just super
[SPEAKER_00]: winter outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you can always take them back
indoors, but it just seems like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: already like indoors is like controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems easier to take breeders that
are exclusively breeding, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor to out in rock wall under LEDs to
just run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those genetics are probably going to do
what you want as opposed to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors and strains being bred for their
outdoor qualities, doing what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's not like you're not going to
find something from the outdoor varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to work great for you
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they were all outdoor varieties
eventually or originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they went indoors and indoors
bred for something specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went back from indoors to
outdoors and oh, what works well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it wasn't that Dutch
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the stuff they already had growing
in the Hills here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people would run the same
strain indoors in their warehouse that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were growing outdoors and under the
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, it's such a mix, but like you
just got to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if I was going to look for
strains to run in a warehouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I wouldn't necessarily go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards my outdoor genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd look for what's like what the market
wants out of, out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but if, you know, for my environment,
if I'm looking for what's going to work
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, like I got to remember what the
market wants, but like, I also got to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that, like, I just grew out a
bunch of stuff from compound and none of
[SPEAKER_00]: it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are, and these are, you know,
these aren't like seeds on pop and these
[SPEAKER_00]: are like selected phenotypes that were
selected in an outdoor depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still not that high on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still not stoked on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I see, but I have other better stuff
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think, you know, when you're
selecting genetics, you should think about
[SPEAKER_00]: what your environment is and where these,
where these selections came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the most important
things is like looking at your environment
[SPEAKER_04]: and choosing genetics based on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect example.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll cite CSI on this because this is his
more his area, but when he was talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about the purple Hindu Kush, this is a
plant grown exclusively, mostly out in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon or NorCal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does real well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have a lot of intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when you bring anything indoors
and breed with it, it's constant herms
[SPEAKER_04]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what he's been telling me is that you
can almost always take indoor stuff out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's herm prone, it's, it's going
to herm less outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll still might herm a little bit,
but when you bring outdoor bred stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor, it's a lot more variable on how
well it will take sexually and stress
[SPEAKER_04]: wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the other consideration I take into
outdoor breeding is depending on where
[SPEAKER_04]: you're at, if a lot of people around you
like Mendocino Humboldt are also growing
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors, there's a, it's a lot harder to
control pollen contamination and Paul
[SPEAKER_04]: we've learned pollen travels miles if it
wants to, it's lighter than air.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the only other things I would
take into consideration, but you're dead
[SPEAKER_04]: on bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people should really be considering
their environment and what genetics are
[SPEAKER_04]: known to work best for their environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of trying to force stuff into
holes that it doesn't necessarily fit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that hermy thing is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like poodle nuts is a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nuts all over the place indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it can be, it can be
suppressed and, and, but it can get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've had her for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but like I've never seen one
hermy paw and sack on a, uh, on a poodle
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown it in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, full, full term plants,
like nothing, nothing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, yeah, that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like generally you can take indoor
genetics and that might have hermy issues
[SPEAKER_00]: or might not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not, you won't see them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see them under the sun really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause even in depth, you won't see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you do a selection out there
and then bring it inside, you might've
[SPEAKER_00]: selected something that, that Hermes all
over the place indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason, I don't know why,
but that's always held true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Jager S1 does that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw down, like it'll throw down big
chunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that shit indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herm's like a bitch like early and late
week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, at like week seven,
you want to run with indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't blow out the whole tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know genetics of the Jager?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jager is purple Hindu Kush, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they claim.
Yeah.
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know anything about that,
but that is bullshit to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, yeah, the, the Jager as far as we
know is Millerville's, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what's supposed to be what
they say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no one's ever really seen the Anis to
even other than not so in a few other
[SPEAKER_04]: people to compare it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know that he's grown Jager to
compare it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just say for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ones, I love it as a smoke,
the S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not, it's got like a little bit
of a cushy flavor to it too, but mostly,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, it's multifaceted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone that's got has been like,
damn, the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a unique one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I wonder if you could like
acclimate the clone indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you have a selection that does
Herm, if you can keep running it indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: and in, you know, time after time after
time again, if it will ever acclimate to
[SPEAKER_04]: not, I don't know, maybe sort of bond with
your room over time and how you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower too, though, like the flower
threw out these real spindly little buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the most skinny buds I've ever seen,
like little fucking pinkies, but then
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor it throws like chunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got it out at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like these big thumbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I saw that a lot with,
um, early on when I was buying seeds from
[SPEAKER_04]: like, like Canada, when I'd see purple
stuff, cause it was at the time it was so
[SPEAKER_04]: rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Oh, it is purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be safe, may say that it's a little
like outdoor, but what the fuck do I know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd order it and indoor, it would be
complete trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Hermi trashed, it was all airy,
but outdoor it's solid as a rock and
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was another thing that I
experienced that like indoor lights don't
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily dense up larpy bud at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like sometimes it just does the opposite
for certain strains that are geared to
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't know what the variable
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is it intensity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it room temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have no idea what that variable is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost seems like indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you've got someone that's like
immunocompromised, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you take them outdoors and they're
fucking eating dirt and worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grower out here that,
that is always, and I've kind of seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he, he kind of like preaches to take
your mom's outside and let them,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them get some of that midsummer sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just sort of revitalize them before
you take them back indoors again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's always preached that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes perfect sense to me because
I mean, the plant really does want that
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum and whatever it is in the
sun, you know, that's not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated well enough indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it really, it really cranks them and,
uh, and it can bring back their health for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor, some sunshine therapy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it, I've always said it's like,
it's impossible to match the spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming off of that burning ball of
helium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's probably factors there
that we can't even quantify that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how he called it a burning ball of
helium.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even consider the sun was helium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly, mostly helium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just noticing that we've maybe got another
like 15, 20 minutes until we hit the two
[SPEAKER_03]: hour mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, one thing I wanted to ask you all
is there's anything changed towards late
[SPEAKER_03]: flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think, okay, today we're probably
not going to get to like harvest and
[SPEAKER_03]: post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that would make a good next
installment to harvest and post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, what about like late flower
specifically?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any other considerations or,
you know, changes in like what you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: have to do day to day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say one, one easy mistake is if
you use timers, which I've always used
[SPEAKER_00]: timers and on valves to, to do,
um, irrigation, um, at a certain point on
[SPEAKER_00]: my outdoor, it's on a timer and it's,
it's whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they get watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when the temperatures drop in,
whether it be September or October,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you reduce the watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're not overwatering plants now
that aren't using as much water because
[SPEAKER_00]: the night temperatures usually cool down
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it takes, you know, it takes more
time in the middle of the day for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant sort of wake up and start drinking
water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's, that's one thing I think
mistakes people make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially on those longer flowering
strains, you could end up overwatering
[SPEAKER_00]: them all of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I'm sure that just leads to
petritis issues and, and, and just not not
[SPEAKER_00]: capturing the, the, uh, the best part or
the most important part of the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's, that's, that would be my
little tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush, anything about late flowering comes
to mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, man, it used to be a big concern for
me, like, you know, super cropping the
[SPEAKER_01]: black cherry soda where I was mostly
worried about weight, but like the late C
[SPEAKER_01]: it, like a lot of, a lot of big concerns
don't crop up for me anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I get a plant that I can see is
susceptible to mold and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like five or seven or eight of her colas
are, are being attacked by it out of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 50 or 60, there was a point
where I would look at that and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, you know, I want to harvest this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stop it before it happens any
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as my, as my goals change
and as my needs for, for what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: growing changed, uh, to just supplying
myself and having enough for some friends
[SPEAKER_01]: and some family to hand out care packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I look at those things and
now I'm not so concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's more like, well, how much can
I push this plant or how, like one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite things to do is after I harvest a
plant, I leave on about an ounce of mids
[SPEAKER_01]: and little sprinkles, uh, just left on the
stem and I'll leave it out there all
[SPEAKER_01]: season until the snow's come and I'll
check on it and I'll see, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: what got really attacked by mold?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what, what's out here way beyond
Amber trichomes where stuff will naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: decay and still doesn't have mold on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, it allows me to experience harsher
conditions with some of these plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they can really stand up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did a living dead girl from CSI two
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Pakistani chitral Kush, Urkel and Girl
Scout cookies, um, mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left a bunch of, I bet I left some larf
and some littles on it and I came out like
[SPEAKER_01]: a month and a half later and I'm looking
at flowers that have no mold on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the other skeletal structures of,
um, some of the Urkel, some of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: half Urkel strains that had basically
baseball sized cult baseball bat colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that stuff is molded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top to bottom turning brown already
decaying past the point of, of life being
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm looking at this other
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, bring on more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what's mold, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it turpinoline?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it was a, it was another,
um, it was the pine tart, not pine tart,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, living dead girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That specific one was the peppery hashing
one that, um, when you ground it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: once you got past the, the initial smells,
then a little bit of fruitiness came out
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the nose, pepper, pepper,
like, uh, spices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was the one that was very,
um, pest resistant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mold as well as pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and she got put to the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was sitting in, you know, she sat
through a couple of snow storms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, she, you know, she endured some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another, another really crazy one that
endured as much wet weather as it could
[SPEAKER_01]: have was the, uh, bubble gum to the Albert
Walker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had that bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: After here in CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about his huge outdoor bubble run
where 80% of it just endured those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those rainstorms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, shit, I'll put it to the
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had it outdoors last year till
October 9th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got hit with five inches of
snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was such a big plant that every
ball, like the way I tie my branches to my
[SPEAKER_01]: cages, it created fulcrums and every
branch broke right where it was tied to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking, I was like,
man, I didn't want to pull this plant down
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to see how far she could really
go in the late season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, she can't do nothing about
snap branches like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the real quick, the blue resin is
flowering super late, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it started late.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it started late and it's flowering
late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, um, I'm looking, I was looking
at it this morning and I'm looking like at
[SPEAKER_01]: another, another two, two and a half weeks
before she's, yeah, it's crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's, she's taking her sweet time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, what do you, what causes that late
flowering trigger?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we even know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard for me to nail it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I moved my garden from,
I moved it like 150 yards down further
[SPEAKER_01]: into a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a little bit light difference
and it's a little bit more of a corridor
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not getting as, as full sunlight
as I was in the spot before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two or three plants that I
expect August 1st by August 1st or August
[SPEAKER_01]: 7th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should see, I'm expecting plants that
are, I can obviously tell they're
[SPEAKER_01]: stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, some of them, it wasn't until
the second or third week of August where I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, oh yeah, this, this lady is like
really reaching out there for the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that, that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's fricking, I was on top of a
six foot tall ladder the other day and I
[SPEAKER_01]: still couldn't get to the top of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unreal how, how tall she is and just
that skinny, super tall profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very interested in the mold part of
that too, because the bonnet's been
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely mold resistant, but Kush is
known for being a mold magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking over this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only saw one little bit of decay and it
was on a lower nug and it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was basically the sugar leaf,
not even a fan leaf or an internal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just an external little bit that
probably came from a caterpillar shitting
[SPEAKER_01]: on it or some other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, it wasn't like, yeah,
it wasn't actual mold created from its own
[SPEAKER_01]: plant decay on itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was external.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good test for it too,
for me, like to have it be so late season
[SPEAKER_04]: up in your area to see how it'll finish
for mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was last year, the plant
wouldn't have last, it's October 17th
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at the weather and like,
we don't even really have a big storm
[SPEAKER_01]: coming on the horizon in the next seven to
10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's all smooth sailing for the
rest of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bubble gum or sorry to get back to
that bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brought out to humble and it was
grown on the coast for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if you can grow on the Humboldt
coast, like you're definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mold resistant in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it was, it was brought from
like Indiana or Michigan or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys did great with it on the,
on the coast, which, which just means it's
[SPEAKER_00]: mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's interesting to hear about
it doing well at higher elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already, it also finishes early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown it myself and I haven't
grown any hybrids of it, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: all I hear is good things about it
outdoors for just a good bulletproof
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, somewhat early finishing,
extreme mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great flavor.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm really sad about is the bubble
gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ballpark bubble gum turps rarely
ever transfer over to the final flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll smell it all the way through,
but when you go to smoke it, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, I wish that bazooka bubble gum was
still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, yeah, that's rough on that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some of the sweet 16 to bubble gum
that I didn't pop this year, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: given this year from CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think because all the sweet 16 so
far has this candy, sweet, rosy things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering if that bubble gum to the
sweet 16 doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lock it in and keep it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause man, all these sweet 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hybrids, dude, it's just like,
it's like walking into a candy shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous how, how good these plants
smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: My money's on turpentine, turning it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only time I've ever experienced pink
bubble gum flavors was with the old sensei
[SPEAKER_04]: star, the superstar from Delta nine labs
that they called the 95 sensei star.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a specific expression in there
that's pink bubble gum and turpentine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for whatever reason, it translates to
flavor super well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do have a bunch of the Durbin bubble
gums from CSI that I'm probably going to
[SPEAKER_04]: run this next year just to see how that
does, you know, how well that translates.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of anise, a little bit of
turpentine right on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be good.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousand you ran the bubble berry indoors,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran it over summer and no
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would normally have expected some
botrytis under those conditions,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was flawless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty chunky, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was chunky too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it did finish early too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your photos, your photos kind of got me
wanting to pop them for next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some from Matt at the party and I'm
like, Ooh, I want to do that outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kill it outdoors, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kill it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some to an Aussie guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sold a few packs of yours,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an out this good actually creep show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is one of the craziest fucking growers
of it I've seen, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful looking plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm looking forward to running it
outdoors too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll be a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the blue sour last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was those mystery seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I did that outdoors and that was
the same, like, uh, really, really fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hot conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess like one 15, one 20 Fahrenheit,
uh, high humidity and like not a click of
[SPEAKER_02]: mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now some good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff was killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some more.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And guys, yeah, this has been a great
chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to touch on like lots and lots
of different aspects of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like I mentioned, we'll probably get
to come back and talk about harvest and
[SPEAKER_03]: post-harvest because that will be kind of
an interesting topic in the end of itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for now was there anything else that
you guys, you know, wanted to mention
[SPEAKER_03]: before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing before we wrap it up,
um, if anybody has any comments,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, about outdoor growing or any tips,
anything we didn't cover that you want us
[SPEAKER_04]: to hear, be sure to leave a comment below
because, uh, yeah, we're always interested
[SPEAKER_04]: and we've been getting amazing comments,
um, from everyone watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be sure to leave a comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else from any of you,
uh, that you wanted to mention?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a good chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked, I feel like there's so much more
we can cover too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like another episode definitely
got to be on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest, harvest, post-harvest,
uh, topics and that, and that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that would be interesting to,
uh, to see how other people are doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like dealing with, dealing with a lot
of harvest at once is always been the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all that you have some crazy stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, one thing is you learn to be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've seen people drop the ball on
getting their harvest rooms ready or
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up some giant legal grow with
consultants, but then not understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their, their plants are going to do a lot
better in Southern Oregon than they did in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have 10 times as much
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and now you've got nowhere to
dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grew all this weed and it basically
just rots on the vine because you got so
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people do that in Mendo too,
where like, you know, you're trying to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up another carport to dry in and that's
already not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, what were you thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how, how do you not think about dry
space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most growers will be like,
Oh man, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to dry it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how are we going to dry it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's like, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the trailer for, for next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next installment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, any shout outs from any of you or
anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise we'll shout you guys out,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to you boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for organizing a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming together and sharing the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this has been really fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, we're getting a really good
response from both the outdoor growing and
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor growing episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, maybe at some point you guys have to
have a dance fight off against each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, but no, it's actually been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had really good engagement on these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it also gives me and Matt like more
time to look at like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: codex episodes or like strain history
episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it all works out really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of like having a really good
balance of content at the moment.
