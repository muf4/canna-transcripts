[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again from all of us at the
Breeders Syndicate family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_02]: the first person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie,
[SPEAKER_02]: not so dog Breeder and grow from Mendocino
to speak on these subjects and sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_02]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start writing some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the hard parts is people
desperately want to hear real stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're trying to figure out like,
well, what's not going to cause too much
[SPEAKER_06]: controversy?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to piss people off?
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just have gotten to the point where
I just say the truth is I know it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to, if you want to,
you know, converse or argue with me
[SPEAKER_06]: politely about it, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm even willing to be convinced,
you know, I got a wife and four daughters,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I hear that I'm wrong a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that we didn't talk about either
that we could talk about at some point,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I don't know if it ties into something
you don't want to talk about, Madjag,
[SPEAKER_06]: but like what made you after like three or
four years of successful growing in those
[SPEAKER_06]: canyons stop?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because like a lot of times like
in Mendo, where I'm at, like people get
[SPEAKER_06]: bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
until, you know, something stops them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like whether it's whether it's
they get wealthy enough that they just
[SPEAKER_06]: decide to go on and do something else or
they get pinched or they get divorced and
[SPEAKER_06]: something blows up in their life or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was stuff, too, when you were
talking about going and visiting the
[SPEAKER_06]: cartels where I had like all kinds of
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was like, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a delicate one to walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so, you know, but yeah,
it because I've had a bunch of friends up
[SPEAKER_06]: here that, you know, they get one
property, they get two properties,
[SPEAKER_06]: they get bigger, they go bigger,
this happens, that happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of a sudden, something changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that part of their life is done for a
bit in that those spots they left,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, because the neighbor got pissed
off or the law enforcement came in or
[SPEAKER_06]: something weird happened and all of a
sudden all that infrastructure and all
[SPEAKER_06]: that time and effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some people just, you know,
they just cashed out and were happy and
[SPEAKER_06]: went on and did something different.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like it fueled some next part of
their life or something, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I I after the last year in Magic
Canyon and making a good amount of money
[SPEAKER_05]: that year, I bought a ranch.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was way beyond my means.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I and my concept was that after one
year before one year before the next
[SPEAKER_05]: payment came to, I would sell a piece of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was an amazing place, had a year
round river stream going through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like five miles of dead end road that it
was at the end of it down in a canyon of
[SPEAKER_05]: its own along the Mogollon Rim.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was incredible, not far from Zane Gray
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't I wasn't able to sell a piece and
I lost the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was it was like, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when I more or less got into
the Mexican import instead, because my
[SPEAKER_05]: friend that I the truck driver,
helicopter pilot, pilot pilot,
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that moved, he could drive it,
fly it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: He plugged us into that whole area in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: And interestingly enough, the strip that
we used was you would drive by it to get
[SPEAKER_05]: to this ranch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was six miles beyond.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was in the same basic zone and
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was easy for me to study and go
investigate and look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we used it three times.
[SPEAKER_05]: For weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they started wanting to do the
other white marching powder, the disco
[SPEAKER_05]: powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we weren't interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I lost touch with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I read about it in the news more or
less later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I wasn't in that area anymore,
I didn't have that ranch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ranch costs a half a million.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I put 50,000 down and lost it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's so I decided to get into something
else that was a little easier,
[SPEAKER_05]: seemed easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was it was for a few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when he when we walked away from him,
we simultaneously through another friend,
[SPEAKER_05]: met a guy in Tucson area who would front
us anywhere from one hundred seventy five
[SPEAKER_05]: to two hundred and fifty pounds of Mexican
Sinsemea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we started sending to the
Rastafarians and in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the that was the best of all,
because we can never send them enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: They whatever we could send them,
because the the sources from Jamaica were
[SPEAKER_05]: very difficult at that point in the early
80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had, you know, it wasn't like the
early days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were using Jamaica as a bounce
from Colombia at that point for cocaine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the the pilots and people who came in
there were not interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And flying some weed from Jamaica up to
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Florida was hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, anything coming into
Florida or that direction was pretty much
[SPEAKER_05]: in trouble by the early 80s, late or mid
80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one one thing I've definitely known
about about cannabis people is if you
[SPEAKER_06]: consider like weed at casino, you could
you could make the score of your life and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're waking up and you're like,
I should take all my money and put it all
[SPEAKER_06]: into chips and go back at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like it's very,
very common with weed people where you're
[SPEAKER_06]: like, this was the most successful year of
my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to throw it all on the table
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that works until it doesn't,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very common in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That risk risk taking is definitely part
of the game for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also don't think humans are very good at
realizing that, like, this could be the
[SPEAKER_06]: the best five years of my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: They think, well, this is my new floor and
only it's I'm on the way up from here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like this could be this could be
a high point and I could be I could be
[SPEAKER_06]: downward sloping it pretty fast in the
next couple.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's part of human nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: We always think that, like, OK,
this is my new floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some instances, you look back and
you're like, wow, that was like really a
[SPEAKER_06]: golden era for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like things were great, you know,
and I didn't I didn't appreciate it quite
[SPEAKER_06]: as much as I should have at the time that
these but that's like youth, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like youth, you know, youth, you have all
this exuberance and very little
[SPEAKER_06]: experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but and sometimes, you know,
that's what, you know, youth, youth makes
[SPEAKER_06]: you do a bunch of shit that an older
person would be too conservative to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're young and dumb and you're just
like, well, let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you guys ready to ready to
light the light, the fuse on this thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first episode, we briefly touched
on your introduction to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: your first time getting high, your first
time kind of the strains that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing around that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there were a lot of Colombians,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was that was the majority of
what we smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was bought off the street,
you know, high school kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, let's talk a little bit
more into the how you got into a more
[SPEAKER_02]: serious side of cannabis, where you
started getting not just into,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, collecting a seed here or there
from this thing, but kind of breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: being more serious about collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, my first like we talked
about in the first episode, I think my
[SPEAKER_00]: first time trying to pop seeds didn't end
too well, came back the next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I believe would have been 1980.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that year we had I had a great place
to grow with a couple of buddies of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a collection of of what turned out
to be killer seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that time, I'd had a lot of time to
research and read about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: research growing and prepare for the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, I started right off doing
hydroponics outdoors in five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets with a medium, which was peat
moss, bagged cow shit, pearlite,
[SPEAKER_00]: and vermiculite using eco grow dry
hydroponic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you get the recipe for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, high times was whatever high
times was selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing they're really good at is
selling rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advertisements back then, it was
basically between Dynagro and and eco
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dynagro was the slicker looking ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked eco grow, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a two part, two part mix of
granular stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I remember mixing up my my
soil mix in the backyard of my parents'
[SPEAKER_00]: house on a big plastic sheet, you know,
breaking down everything and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lifting up one side and another to make it
roll and tumble and mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, somewhere in the house,
my parents were probably watching me
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, what the hell are we going to do
about this kid?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they never they never
stopped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were just kind of marveling
at, you know, the daringness of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, yeah, that that season we had we
had a Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had we had that that Maui that I told
you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a red bud, what I call red bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was one of those rare times when
you kind of leapfrog that the dude that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been buying weed from for a year or
so and you've gotten to know suddenly lets
[SPEAKER_00]: you in on something at a higher level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in this case, the dude needed
somebody to drive him to pick up a load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess all of his usual people
weren't available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or maybe he just needed somebody that
was that was disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was under 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if we got busted,
you know, probably nothing was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to me too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had a he had a nineteen seventy
nine smokey in the bandit black trans am
[SPEAKER_00]: the you know, the four hundred cubic inch
big block in there with the golden eagle
[SPEAKER_00]: on the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy let me drive his car down
down this these gravel roads and into the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just nothing but farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, are there weed people out
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we went down this kind of
this gravel road along the fence along the
[SPEAKER_00]: fence line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a farmhouse at the end of
the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy the guy said, OK, here,
let's change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drive now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to stop me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to come back here and you're
going to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to wait 15 minutes and then
turn around, come back and pick me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, OK, you know, I can follow those
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, driving this car was was just
dream come true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, amazing ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I followed instructions,
came back a little while later,
[SPEAKER_00]: scared, but, you know, excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went back, you know, he came in
through something in the back and off we
[SPEAKER_00]: went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned out it was the you know,
it was what we called red bud back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could have been Colombian red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been Panama red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have I'll never really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these things, these buds were fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was used to getting stuff that was
pressed into bricks by a hydraulic press,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that by the time you got it and
broke apart, you know, went through a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very dense, you know, seeds smashed and,
you know, the leaves and flowers and stems
[SPEAKER_00]: all pressed together into into kind of
when you broke it apart, you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really tell what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this stuff, it was loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was uncompressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single bud in the in the in the
in the in the bags was like the tip of
[SPEAKER_00]: your finger, about an inch and a quarter
inch and a half long, spongy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was dark, dark red, like like blood
that had dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like a scab almost color.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were they were roundish,
like the tip of your finger, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark, dark red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, this stuff, when you smoked it,
you know, the effect was very sedative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was hashy and the taste
was, you know, dark, like dark wood and
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like like you would
imagine if you could smoke ebony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably wouldn't recommend that,
you know, for kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you could, you know, had that dark
wood like like like some sort of charred
[SPEAKER_00]: oak barrel used for bourbon or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like mahogany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mahogany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it tasted like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it fermented at all, do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was it was like fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no moldy, no sort of funk to it
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this shit had been had been allowed
to mature past peak on the plant in a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where weather wasn't wasn't wasn't
destroying the plants at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it must have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was gorgeous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had that I found seeds and that he
gave me he gave me like a half ounce for
[SPEAKER_00]: being his wheel man, which I was like,
man, I want to do that every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I never never got the
chance to do that again for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it was I had we had that
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a few from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Mexican I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess if it was I was 17,
17.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had like a collection of these
different things that we would all kill
[SPEAKER_00]: for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All growing that red weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's that you don't even really see
pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anymore in magazines or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody not that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that farmhouse that we went to,
you know, that's kind of the way stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it was some sort of biker
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'd been I went to a couple
of places that were either biker places or
[SPEAKER_00]: actually famous people places that I'm not
going to I can't really say because it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: give away too much info about,
you know, who and where.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's funny, you know,
like rock and roll group type thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, houses associated with with
Southern rock bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They smoked a lot of fucking weed in the
Southern rock bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that that season started off
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got him up to about about six,
seven feet tall and a huge storm came
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that red bud plant, which I don't
know, you've got a picture of it actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can put that up or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that was unique
about it, first of all, the weeds were
[SPEAKER_00]: very wide for, you know, what we call a
sativa, you know, highly, highly serrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the distinctive things about
that plant was that the nodes on the on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant were were zigzag, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of instead of the axles where
the petioles come off the stem being
[SPEAKER_00]: symmetrical and coming off in pairs of
two, you know, yeah, it would it started
[SPEAKER_00]: zigzagging very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that leads to a structure
on the plant where the flowers kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stack offset from each other when it goes
into flower and they fill in all the gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see that sometimes with ohes today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see plants that have that same kind of
zigzag, you know, branching pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know exactly what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, get on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the storm hits and it breaks,
it breaks that plant over right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, today, I'd be like,
well, OK, let's just make one big giant
[SPEAKER_00]: clone of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it would have been it
would have been 100 clones off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, but me and my me and my
teenage partners were just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, no, you know, it's dead, Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we were all we lost that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we moved we moved all these plants
through the woods, five gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, seven, seven foot tall in five
gallon buckets through the woods,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of hundred yards to a better
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were afraid for some security
scare at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tie plant went, you know,
to the new spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hawaiian, the Maui went to the new
spot, the Mexican went to the new spot.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so everything else we grew to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were there were two of the tie
plants and there's there's a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: that one of the ties in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture there is what wound up being
the purple tie that we grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, from from an appearance
standpoint, people are really you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll hear a lot of people talking with
great certainty about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, tie plants have, you know,
wide, highly serrated leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's often described as being the
alligator tail leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also tie plants which
are, you know, have extremely narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and and have a completely different
kind of serration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other distinctive leaf traits,
which I don't really like to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's kind of my clue to know
whether somebody has the real thing or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, stuff like that's important
to keep back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't realize that,
like, there's certain traits and in
[SPEAKER_02]: certain lines that, like, you don't really
want to say openly because of people who,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, manipulate shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when they do when they do when
they release information about,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, this isn't my real house,
it's more Matt's.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when they release information about,
like, murders and stuff like that and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're looking for they're looking for
help, they actually put in details
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes that are slightly not correct so
that they can weed through the hundreds of
[SPEAKER_06]: tips that they get when people are like,
oh, yeah, this, this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh, no, that was that
was actually part of the fake that we put
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because, yeah, people will as
soon as you say it, people will find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll have stories about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a real it's an interesting part
of, like, talking about history or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever is are those kind of little keys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any good examples of a
broadleaf tie before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a true like in its in its in nature,
not just saying this is a tie,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like an actual broadleaf tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the book by Lawrence Cherniak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great books of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm perfectly willing to believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all I know is I bought the the
first version of great books of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: like just like volume one, whatever that
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in, you know, early 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that book, there's a picture of of
a patch of tieweed growing under some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of canopy in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all have that that wide leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're definitely wide leaf,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the tie that I was growing came
from sticks that one of my partner's older
[SPEAKER_00]: brother brought back home in a tie and
some tie stick he got at University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, Denver, Boulder, wherever the
hell he was going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came back home to be with his
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my my buddy found his stash on a tray
under his bed and stole the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to smoke a little bit, but,
you know, he was pretty stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pretty stingy with the stuff he had
stolen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I'm sure that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more narrowly the stuff that you
guys grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like back to that point,
you know, about the information about
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive traits that, you know,
releasing it and not so when I were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, as much as I want
to share everything that I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I what my fear is that things that things
that you don't I've never heard anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else talking about on forums that are,
you know, unique tie traits that that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, were very distinctive for me
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm just afraid that if I say
it, then the next thing you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be, you know,
10 guys on Instagram selling old school
[SPEAKER_00]: tie heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just going to have this bullet
points of whatever I say here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a legitimate fear, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I we we definitely talk
about that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it's one of the things that like
the entire second generation of like of
[SPEAKER_06]: like Amsterdam breeders just decided to be
absolutely completely vague with lineage
[SPEAKER_06]: because they got so tired of competitors
stealing the exact ad copy and being like,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, it's this, you know, and they got
very secretive on what it was and where it
[SPEAKER_06]: came from and how to this and how to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we we see it now on IG even with
certain names of strains and different
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it's kind of a catch 22.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you want to get the information
out there, but it also feeds people that
[SPEAKER_06]: want to fake stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it definitely does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you say it on this show,
I can almost guarantee that someone will
[SPEAKER_02]: have it up tomorrow for sale somehow in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like you said, like little bullet
points, it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the other side of it and
you know, this is what we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the other day is that it's like,
well, you know, Thailand is just reopened,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from for legal legal production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, even even over there,
I mean, there's just so much happening
[SPEAKER_00]: right now that maybe if, you know,
the information that I have might be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful to somebody the next thing,
you know, better selections are made and
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff actually does become available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's it's a it's a bit of a
it's a bit of a conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to hold back on some of
those details right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that that particular we
grew two of those type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was green in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other was purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purple one was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll just I'll go ahead and talk
about the effects of Thai versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as opposed to, you know,
selection, things that would be help
[SPEAKER_00]: people earlier on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the effects of it,
I sat down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got in trouble in high school a lot,
right, mostly because because I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: give a crap about the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd come in every morning and,
you know, get get really high before
[SPEAKER_00]: school walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, just kind of chill
there until lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: After lunchtime, the buzz was wearing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd come back and and fall asleep in the
next class right afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, you know, all I really cared
about was weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd fallen in love with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my my first great love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's never really ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I I would sit there and I'd
got in trouble for like whatever absences
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever and get get in school
suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that was a challenge to get
really, really high because you're sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there in in in a classroom with a bunch of
other delinquents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're forced to sit there
and be silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're supposed to you're supposed to
be doing schoolwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was already not doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wasn't going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically would sit there and I
started writing, describing inspired by R.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I would sit down and describe the
effects of the high that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was describing that the effect of
the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote like a page and a half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still remember it, even though this
other kid that was in class liked what I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: written so much, they asked if he could
keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you know, the effects of
the high were very different from
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian of the day or Mexican or even,
you know, what we you know, what we know
[SPEAKER_00]: today is the Hayes high in that it was it
was totally introspective.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hayes and Colombians can make
you feel connected with things around you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the tieweed was totally introspective
instead of being connected with things
[SPEAKER_00]: around you, other people, nature,
whatever, it was all in the head and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was all and it felt like waves.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where and your thoughts were kind of going
from, you know, smoothly connecting from
[SPEAKER_00]: one thought to another kind of,
you know, ebbing and flowing as as as you
[SPEAKER_00]: as you kind of go through these musings of
different things inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in that way, very, very
different from from the Colombian that we
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, was our normal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you would you say that it would lead
you closer to paranoia because it was so
[SPEAKER_02]: introspective like an ego crusher?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or would you say it was more freeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was luxurious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was smooth like like a tide,
you know, coming and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was not it didn't have that that
electrically charged anxiety that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: feel sometimes with with, you know,
a particular particular phenos of Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was very much kind of,
you know, had a bit of a dreamy aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you were very, very awake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you associate the clear headed high
that you described with tie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had the same experience with
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hayes is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's very, very different.
[SPEAKER_06]: That leads me to a thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Raho, you and and and Madjag could
talk like when you guys were all consuming
[SPEAKER_06]: this stuff, you know, basically pure and
like not not all mixed together like we
[SPEAKER_06]: got it way later or like hints of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What, you know, you just touched on it a
little bit, but like what were the big
[SPEAKER_06]: differences you noticed between like,
say, smoking pure Mexican, pure Thai and
[SPEAKER_06]: pure Colombian?
[SPEAKER_06]: You kind of just talked about that a
little bit in terms of Thai versus
[SPEAKER_06]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what, you know, you know, were there
other distinct differences you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: noticed in the highs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have preferences of what you
really liked one versus the other because
[SPEAKER_06]: of was it consistent or did it just vary
from plant to plant a bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me Madjag, let me just keep going on
this for just a second because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have much to say about Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a rare, rare thing where we
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when it showed up,
it was unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it didn't have the sedative kind
of knock it knocked down power of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was light, uplifting,
tasted great, energetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, it didn't have the
depth of effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed a little superficial to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was very limited experience that
I had with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm just not an expert on
Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it, grew some of the seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They matured way early compared to the
Colombians, so much so that I actually let
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff go over mature past peak,
you know, resin development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm pretty sure that I lost
some potency off letting it go too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the the tie was just
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so special that, you know,
I only sold like one bag of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that I sold it to, you know,
wanted more immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guarantee if we could find him right
now, he would still tell you that that he
[SPEAKER_00]: remembered that smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was probably maybe the best weed
he'd ever smoked in his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it was that that unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Colombian, we're lucky today
because we have so much good example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so much of what was available in
the Colombian, you know, in the breadth of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian weed back in the day has been
captured somewhere in the Hayes genome and
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible through anybody who's wanted to
put in the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's that's it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got mad, Jag, as far as your
high experiences between Thai,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican, Hawaiian, even things that have
acclimated to Hawaii, Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would say that he summarized it
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombians, when they showed up,
they were just so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them were so overwhelming couch
lock that you hear stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my friend from Colombia had this weed
that was truly wacky weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who first wrote about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was R who discussed it,
having gotten something city and.
[SPEAKER_05]: People, you know, would fall down stairs,
they would throw up, they would their
[SPEAKER_05]: sense of balance would go off so bad that
they would fall down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mexican was not like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexican was more all the ones I smoked,
even the ones that were really strong were
[SPEAKER_05]: still like social and uplifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't smoke like my friends who,
you know, would roll hash joints all all
[SPEAKER_05]: day and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a different level of of on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were they needed testers like myself
that were with smoke one to twice a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was some of those early Colombian
Mexicans that my friend who was the dealer
[SPEAKER_05]: in Tempe got were just outstanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when people tried them, you were
talking about green weed earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Raja was or maybe it was not so.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, once they saw it and tried
it, it was they didn't care the color.
[SPEAKER_05]: But most people were used to the
compressed brick weed, brown weeds and
[SPEAKER_05]: even lots of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this once it switched over to the
seedless since the Mia coming over from
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michoacan, particularly will Hawkin and
Guerrero.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those three zones were each one was
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: The smoke was different, but they were all
uplifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that they couldn't paralyze you
because sativas can be get on the racy
[SPEAKER_05]: side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know what you're talking about,
the paranoia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I was paranoid or just
actually knew someone was after me,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through that a few times with
smoking Thai weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a small window of period that I
even saw Thai weed on the market or people
[SPEAKER_05]: selling it like sixty nine to maybe
seventy four.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never saw it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard stories about it and never saw it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was ahead of all the other sativas when
it hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's a bunch of articles in old
high times that are writes about,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's talking about like the
disappearance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can almost like document like the
years, the disappearance of Colombian for
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit, the disappearance of Thai
for a while, the resurgence of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much you can learn just by
reading just his articles in high times
[SPEAKER_02]: during those years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you taken the time to scan those
articles and we could compile,
[SPEAKER_05]: compile just an R book?
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: You did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have every single one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From from when did he stop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think eighty four, eighty five is
the last step I see from our.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think about eighty five he bounced
from high times and then continued his
[SPEAKER_02]: career writing about Adolf Hitler,
like the history of Adolf Hitler and Nazi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a lot of very extreme opinions,
political opinions, but not not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily like he wasn't an extremist by
any stretch of the imagination.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he quit writing about weed and he's
still very well known.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear from him sometimes
since he's still with us on this side of
[SPEAKER_02]: the shadow realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I think is curious, I heard it
from both Raho and Madjag is that because
[SPEAKER_06]: in modern times, so I want to follow up on
it just real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: In modern times, we kind of consider
sativa to be thin leafed, uplifting,
[SPEAKER_06]: paranoia, trippy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has these various effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you guys were both mentioning that
there was some pure sativas that were
[SPEAKER_06]: couch locky.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say like modern people today,
everybody thinks that if if you get couch
[SPEAKER_06]: locked, it's the Indica something coming
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like people don't associate couch lock at
all with any kind of pure sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just heard both Raho and you mention
that some of the pure sativas you smoked
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of were like, you know, couch lock.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they were the Colombian sativas
to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mexican sativas were very powerful,
but you still wanted to go do something,
[SPEAKER_05]: go hiking, go climbing, you know,
go bowling even.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Colombians, the couch locky Colombians
were just so overwhelmingly powerful and
[SPEAKER_05]: they were pure sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard people talk about Colombian
Indicas and I don't I don't think that's
[SPEAKER_05]: correct unless they were introduced,
you know, to Colombia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where genetics have spread, it's possible,
but not native to the jungles.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also think there's a part of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead, Raho.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to comment on the couch lock
and the Indica from Colombia, the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica and Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, the couch lock piece
of it, it must be, you know, it's just so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to get a Colombian to reach maturity
in outdoors in the kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes that most of us live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, part of it may be that we just
never really get it there to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where those those those those effects
become, you know, come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also Colombia, you know, as a country,
it's just got such a diverse kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: breadth of different kinds of wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, from, you know,
from the from the gold up Santa Marta,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interesting that, you know,
people talk about Indica in Colombia
[SPEAKER_00]: because Santa Marta, you know,
the times that I had it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: legit from Florida, from my one of my
buddies, Deadhead Sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this stuff was fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pressed, but it was bright,
bright yellow gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, it was it was moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the moisture level throughout
this stuff was very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the calyxes, large golden
calyxes kind of throughout these these
[SPEAKER_00]: little chips of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there was gold and a little
bit of green in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we smoked it, the taste was,
you know, it had a lot in common with with
[SPEAKER_00]: what we think of as Indica today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it had that same kind of
hashiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had some citrus elements to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was there was also something
that you just don't really find in in
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a sandalwood taste in there,
which was was unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but it's funny that there was so
much in common with Indica, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of that gold while being,
you know, probably something completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that at some point there was
some pharmaceutical company that was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, you know, took genetics down to
Colombia and did some work down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the details of it,
but I'm not throwing out a theory that
[SPEAKER_00]: that had anything to do with Santa Marta
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just just what I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest issue I would have with
Indica's making their way down to Colombia
[SPEAKER_06]: is that they would just flower at like,
you know, at shin height or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you really have to breed
them heavily into the native stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: because, you know, it's it's Colombian is
basically equatorial.
[SPEAKER_06]: The equator runs right through Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, if you put out pure
Indica there, they would literally flower
[SPEAKER_06]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Within a matter of days, they would start
putting on they would start putting on
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's interesting that,
like, we've accepted that wide leaf is
[SPEAKER_06]: always means that there's Indica heritage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thin leaf always leans towards sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sativas have this certain set of highs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Indica's have this other set of
highs and the two don't overlap.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically what you guys are talking
about right now is that there's a range of
[SPEAKER_06]: leaf with and there's a range of highs
that maybe they do overlap some more than
[SPEAKER_06]: people thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my experience with Mexicans was
that they were kind of rushy and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of the effect, you know,
was uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was head rushy, but the duration
of the effect was not that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your audio is clipping a little bit,
buddy.
OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: The duration of which was sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The duration of the the duration of the
Max was was not as not as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was head rushy, you know,
uplifting, you know, positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but nowhere near didn't last anywhere
near as long as the Colombians and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombians were more of a kind of zonked
part of that part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the commercial stuff was
probably because of processing handling,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the degradation of the cannabinoids
to CBN and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you talk about sativas
being trippy, that's that's kind of a pet
[SPEAKER_00]: peeve for me because it's it's such a
vague term to say trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost to the point of being
meaningless.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I'm not an expert on on
trip tripping, but, you know, the it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like people could be a little better about
describing the effects and saying trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a pet peeve for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I think that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think the language around
highs is individual, and I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: times people think whatever happens to
them is what the weed does.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's it's always been interesting to
me that some people, it's a lot easier for
[SPEAKER_06]: them to smoke weed and trigger a paranoia
experience where other people can smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: that same cannabis and not feel that at
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just like warm and happy and
energetic and they feel great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other person that smoked the same
joint is like ready to crawl out their
[SPEAKER_06]: skin and maybe needs an intervention from
their friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so I think like how it interacts
with our bodies isn't as understood as we
[SPEAKER_06]: would like, you know, and we think it's
monolithic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, this weed does this to
these people.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not always the case, I don't
think, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanted to mention something when we
talk about Colombian or we talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: Panama, we talk about Thai or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that gets talked about
with Colombian a lot is Colombia is pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: mountainous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they talk about lowland Colombians
that are grown in the valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then highland Colombians that were
grown like way more up in the mountain
[SPEAKER_06]: valleys or even on ridges and things like
that where the elevation was much
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those two things seem to grow quite a
bit differently and probably have
[SPEAKER_06]: different highs, too, you know,
because their climates are so much
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Madjag and I have have a friend
who's kind of an expert in the in the
[SPEAKER_00]: variation within, you know, the Colombian
family of plants from effects to taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, terps, you know, just this guy can
go through and do a fino hunt on a line
[SPEAKER_00]: and just basically of haze types or,
you know, punta roja or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: various and just basically slice it and
dice it out into different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely different Colombian types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that level of, you know,
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to run way more plants than I
ever did to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess this guy is just he's really
passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highland lowland, you know, it's like,
geez, man, by the time it got here,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody really knows where it came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always always get a little irked about
that because it just seems like marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: talk more than more than the reality of
what happened, where the farmer did his
[SPEAKER_00]: work, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I think that I think certainly like not
knowing where it came from is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I talked before on one of our
previous episodes about you guys are
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about Oaxacan and Guerrero and
Mitchell Khan and the differences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I was getting Mexican in high
school, by then it was just straight
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_06]: You weren't getting any regional
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was green and brown and you were
hoping to get the lesser compressed stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: that was green.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was that was your goal, if you could.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as like where it came from,
by the time the 90s were around and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking it, you had no idea that your
dealer didn't know their dealer didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how high up the chain you'd
have to go before someone had an idea of
[SPEAKER_06]: origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's all Madjacks fault for
giving those two kilos a seat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, you know, even if they I
just don't I mean, maybe people knew,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it wasn't trickling down to 16 or 17
or 18 year old me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was too many layers in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's still there's maps that they
have nowadays that talk about which
[SPEAKER_02]: cartels are going which routes and we're
going into which things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's like the best idea we
can grab from anywhere right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I agree even even, you know,
I came in 10 years after not so and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: the same experience like you have Mexican
and you have Mexican and you have like
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican that's not as compressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes, honestly, the stuff that
wasn't as compressed wasn't as good as the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that was compressed for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it always looked way better and
smelled way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it never really had the same kind of
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like good old big Mexican and
big old good Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I actually speaking of them,
I actually just read this thing yesterday,
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys, where they were talking about
the I don't know what they they have some
[SPEAKER_06]: nickname for them that I don't remember,
but they were calling that like the kids
[SPEAKER_06]: of El Chapo and how they realized that,
like, if they want Mexican to be
[SPEAKER_06]: considered world class weed, they need to
reinvent it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it sounds like they're doing
something similar where they're gathering
[SPEAKER_06]: up genetics from all over the place,
because they have money and space and
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're trying to reinvent things,
figuring that it's going to go legal
[SPEAKER_06]: before too, too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they want to be at the forefront at
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like there's some pretty
extensive breeding projects and they have
[SPEAKER_06]: an interest in it of taking it from like
your traditional good old Mexican and like
[SPEAKER_06]: reinventing it for the modern market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they've got the longest time in
this bit or some of the longest time in
[SPEAKER_02]: this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes sense that they'd want to keep
their business control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is their their stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their own challenges down there,
just like Thailand does and just like we
[SPEAKER_00]: do in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, the impact of the war
on drugs has just blighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just caused the massive
loss of so much heirloom genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the positive thing is that,
you know, as as they're reopening,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like in Thailand, there are going to
be pockets of people who have kept this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff alive that are going to kind of pop
up from their from their holes and and and
[SPEAKER_00]: start doing the work again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know Jackie and I both have we
have we have friends down in Mexico who,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, are in remote areas working with
very old genetics, people who have kept
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff alive and and are working to
kind of bring bring back something from
[SPEAKER_00]: the glory days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's very, very humble people,
very passionate about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's I feel honored to to,
you know, read about their work when I get
[SPEAKER_00]: the chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who else is really passionate
about spreading land races?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, had to had to bring in our boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was holding up his he loves doing
his favorite possessions as his Arjun
[SPEAKER_06]: bobblehead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the king of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all cartel, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We we know a couple of individuals who are
outside of that realm, and they're just
[SPEAKER_05]: humble farmer type guys that are on
forums.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I I've never smoked any of
it or had anyone that I know so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I receive it from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually from here being sent down to
them because they're interested in seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: also.
[SPEAKER_05]: But back to the Colombian part.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colombia, like you mentioned,
there's lowland, there's the highlands,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's the valleys and Santa Marta way up
in the north next to Venezuela,
[SPEAKER_05]: almost on the Caribbean, the high
elevation of Santa Marta's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every one of those was a distinct high
early, at least in 1969, 70, 71,
[SPEAKER_05]: 72, 73.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met my Colombian friend who I end up
being friends with, and he stayed in the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States for eight years at the
Redway in Redway at the Tavern Country
[SPEAKER_05]: Tavern in 1973.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he I think I mentioned, you know,
that wacky weed that he had was I've never
[SPEAKER_05]: seen anything still that's that potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it it was compressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was black.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was seedless.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was from one source.
[SPEAKER_05]: One old grower, he said, has been growing
weed since the 40s up in the mountains in
[SPEAKER_05]: Neva, N-E-I-V-A.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he would get five or six ounces at a
time in New York City.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they look like chunkies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're in aluminum foil in a square
maybe two inches by two inches by an inch
[SPEAKER_05]: thick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so I told Raho this in 1973,
it sold for one hundred dollars an ounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was people in Arizona that
would drive from Flagstaff to Phoenix on a
[SPEAKER_05]: phone call.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you said there's some here you have to
come now, they would drive immediately two
[SPEAKER_05]: and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of the wacky weed
specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was so rare and so unusual.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he used a razor blade to cut it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like a chunk of hash and he
would just zip off little little fragments
[SPEAKER_05]: and roll half joints, New York needles,
pin joints, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if I mentioned it on the
show earlier, but one of my friends from
[SPEAKER_05]: Chicago came out to Phoenix and he took
one hit on one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was it was really hard to pull
because they were so near so thin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as he did, he fell forward and hit his
face against a brick wall, broke his
[SPEAKER_05]: glasses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And went unconscious on the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I I didn't really I've I smoked it
quite a few times, but when I did,
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to sit down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the ultimate couch luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I I didn't want to go hiking or
do anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for him and two other friends in
Tempe, it made them more normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the more they smoked,
the more that they could do stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for me, it was like green kryptonite
for me and red kryptonite for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's I've seen that a lot with
like I have what I consider like at least
[SPEAKER_02]: typically I'm reversed from what most
people feel when they smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I smoke more longer flowering narrow
leaf type plants to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas pure Afghanis, even things like
skunk one, don't agree with me at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make me paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and it's just not it gives me this
nasty funky feeling, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird how different brain chemistry
can really, really flip all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed from going, you know,
as a young man smoking to being,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 41 now, how weed affects me is
drastically different than it did when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was young.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think it's just the level of
potency in the weed, more like hormones
[SPEAKER_02]: and things how we how our brain chemistry
and body chemistry change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just has such a drastic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing I found to hold true
with a lot of males is that when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: young, cannabis affects them a lot
different than when they're older.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people are older, they tend to
experience the paranoia and stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't have when they were younger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hormones run everything, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they do age.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your hormones are different at different
stages of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually
[SPEAKER_02]: just started his new hormone regimen,
so I'm really proud of him for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, I will say that at my
age, which, you know, in my mid 40s,
[SPEAKER_06]: IG constantly wants me to regrow my hair,
get more testosterone, become more manly,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, just started getting the TRT
ads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The targeted ads they have for people that
are 46.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, oh, man, they really are.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really are trying to make it seem
like I'm falling apart, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't don't fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fight the algorithm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just slam it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a couple of points that,
you know, when I first started growing
[SPEAKER_06]: indoor, which is how I started because I
lived in Chicago and that was like that
[SPEAKER_06]: was the only way you could get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff that we were getting from
Amsterdam and all that, it was primarily
[SPEAKER_06]: indica weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the only sativa weed I really had
experience with when I was young was
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexican, which I didn't think was all that
potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do remember like after a few years
of growing, asking some of my connections
[SPEAKER_06]: to get me like the best green Mexican that
they could, because I found that like,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though it wasn't as nice and it
didn't taste as good as the stuff we were
[SPEAKER_06]: doing ourselves, it had a completely
different buzz than all of these Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_06]: based heavy indica strains that we were
running indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had this clear memory of I think it
was in 1997 when they released Neville's
[SPEAKER_06]: Haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Neville's Haze was kind of like the
haziest or the most sativa thing that had
[SPEAKER_06]: been released up till that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That at least like normal people could get
access to.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by that point, I had made enough
friends in Amsterdam that when I went over
[SPEAKER_06]: there and visited, I got to I got to try
some different things that weren't just
[SPEAKER_06]: from coffee shops, but were from some
collectors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I clearly remember I thought about
this when Madjag was talking, I clearly
[SPEAKER_06]: remember smoking a pinner joint with the
guy and my buddy who had come with me,
[SPEAKER_06]: three of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like it didn't go very far.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got so soaring high off this sativa
that it almost felt like air was rushing
[SPEAKER_06]: over my brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we walked out of his little
his little flat in Amsterdam, there was
[SPEAKER_06]: about six or seven steps that went down to
the cobblestone street or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I held the railing to make sure I was
going to make it down those steps safely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I felt like, you know, at this time,
it was 1997.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was I was in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had this clear memory of like
looking down the stairs and being like,
[SPEAKER_06]: I better hold the railing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because I was nervous about like
my sense of balance, my equilibrium,
[SPEAKER_06]: where my head was at, with my head,
with my feet obey my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, had have we broken that chain
where my legs and arms aren't going to
[SPEAKER_06]: obey what's coming out of my mind and tell
them what to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was not something that I had
experienced before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of a sudden, I had this memory of
like maybe some of these older guys
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about this, like psychedelic or
these trippy experiences off sativas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they weren't bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because for a minute, it was just
completely outside the realm of my
[SPEAKER_06]: experience with all of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like very heavy Afghan or at best Afghan
sativa weed that leaned Afghan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people weren't buying and growing
pure sativas then.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, all the all the all the seed
banks and stuff, you know, were basically
[SPEAKER_06]: growing, you know, mostly predominantly
indica leaning stuff, because that was
[SPEAKER_06]: easy and chunky and small and manageable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just it just it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what you got, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this this weed, this weed that hits you
like that was that you're saying this was
[SPEAKER_00]: a pure sat.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was Neville Hayes, which is OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Neville Hayes was, you know, it's it's
basically the two the two Hayes males that
[SPEAKER_06]: Neville had with a little bit of northern
lights in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on if you believe, Sam,
more northern lights in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, whatever, whatever the case may
be, it was it was I mean, that cut still
[SPEAKER_06]: exists.
[SPEAKER_06]: That cut still gets grown and sold in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was, you know, some people describe
it as racy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people got paranoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people I literally got, you know,
I know you said you don't like trippy,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I got tracers in my vision where my
vision was altered.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I was concerned about my
legs obeying my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like as a 22 year old,
I didn't usually grab the railing to like
[SPEAKER_06]: go down six or seven steps.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think I think that's basically
the piece of Neville's work right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that I got smoked out by a buddy
right about that same time period of some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that that had the exact same
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're sitting there and I don't
like bongs, but, you know, he he smoked me
[SPEAKER_00]: out on this bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I it after I coughed my
head off, I sat on the couch and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: went into like silent mode, you know,
for for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you've seen this before,
you know, I mean, where I sat there not
[SPEAKER_00]: saying a word and just like freaking out
until finally I was like, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's like, OK, see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I walk out of this place and
I'm stumbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like head spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go down these stairs and I'm
grabbing onto that railing for my dear
[SPEAKER_00]: wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to try and drive home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, three miles from my
house, get totally lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on roads that I've driven a thousand
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of calling into work and
say, hey, I'm so messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call in on the sick line and I'm like,
hey, I I'm lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave a recording for my co-workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them I'm not going to be in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the wrong turn and I don't know
where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I mean, that's to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is his legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, you know, and this is the same stuff
probably that turned into the Cuban black
[SPEAKER_00]: and all those other famous NL Hazes out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is the kind of thing that
came from Neville's Peak.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of the stuff that he called at
the beginning of his Holy Grail project
[SPEAKER_06]: because he regretted like by the time that
he realized how special Hayes was,
[SPEAKER_06]: he had already lost several of the plants
that he had gotten from seed because they
[SPEAKER_06]: were just such an enormous pain in the ass
to grow and keep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and he was, you know, he, he only had
the two males and then he lost the one
[SPEAKER_06]: male in 89.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he ended up out of the six or seven
plants he had, he only ended up with one
[SPEAKER_06]: probably by 90 or 91.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the Neville's Hayes was his,
his attempt to cross two of them together
[SPEAKER_06]: with a little bit of indica in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that was going to be the basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: For his project.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it was going to be a private
breeding, I believe, but then it was just
[SPEAKER_06]: so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: They decided to release it to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: People underestimate the impact of that NL
five that Neville made those crosses with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's kind of like a turbo or a
supercharger on an engine for that sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it cranked up the quantity of
cannabinoids in, in, in any particular
[SPEAKER_00]: nugget, um, just because the resin
production was way up the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, if, if you ran it in a lab,
like, um, like people do today and you
[SPEAKER_00]: compare it to the Hayes with, you know,
uh, the NL hybrid, you'd find just a much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher level of cannabinoids simply
because there's more resin there per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and that, that NL five was,
you know, the peak of, of his,
[SPEAKER_00]: his NL breeding work, you know,
it was the best plus the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, to say, that it's just a
little bit of NL, um, maybe that's all it
[SPEAKER_00]: took, but I consider it, you know,
to be a real multiplier on the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: those Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We recently, we discounted, we recently
learned some other stuff that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, kind of dovetails into maybe something
we can talk about a little bit involving
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the pearls and girls and early
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it was that Neville's,
apparently one of his main things he
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to do was rewire work, the early
pearl and find that early pearl or early
[SPEAKER_02]: girl that he had originally encountered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always thought that was interesting
because I always thought the NL five and
[SPEAKER_02]: the NL work was probably the peak of what
he considered his like Afghani type work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess at the end he was chasing the
pearl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so he was working with a lot of
Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I guess one of the reasons why he
was working with a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexicans that he could get.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was because that early girl and early
pearl, he loved the sweetness of the
[SPEAKER_06]: flavor and the high so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was trying to find it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it was one of those things
that he thought would be common,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and then he lost it and couldn't
get it back type of type of gig,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, because the era had passed or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, some of it, some of his
associates in, um, that were very close to
[SPEAKER_06]: him in the last 10 years of his life have
said that one of his main projects,
[SPEAKER_06]: in addition to like the Sativa side,
of, you know, uh, the holy grail extreme
[SPEAKER_06]: Sativas was also like bringing back some
of those, the Mexican memories that he
[SPEAKER_06]: had.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and that was what was captured in,
cause early girl and early pearl are
[SPEAKER_06]: basically predominantly Mexican with a
little bit of Afghan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and he was infatuated with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He really was.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted the flavor and the buzz of
certain kinds of Wahakans that he had.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted that back again, really badly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't blame him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that, that early, early pearl,
you know, the at its best is just
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious smoke with a great effect,
you know, I mean, but the problem he
[SPEAKER_00]: probably ran into was that, you know,
it was by the time he started trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: recapture it, it was damn near impossible
to find it coming out of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cartels had taken control of who grew
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, if you tried to take your
stuff through the plazas, and I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: this, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just from reading stuff and other
people who know, know it firsthand or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, but from what I understand,
if, you know, if you were a small producer
[SPEAKER_00]: or cranking out a family heirloom on,
on your little piece of land and tried to,
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to sell it, move it across the
border or whatever you might get in some
[SPEAKER_00]: very serious problems with the cartel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they kept a lock on this stuff and
hybrids were the order of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he must've had a very hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know from reading his posts on,
on, you know, Mr. Nice, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was, and his catalog also,
you know, he thought early Pearl needed,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you read what he, what he put in his
catalog, he said that early Pearl needed
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was, he crossed it to skunk and
then was doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try and get it where he wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those were probably mainly
commercial and, you know, goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding goals that he was pursuing
instead of connoisseur goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess later he wanted to appreciate
what was unique about the Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, but I guess he didn't have much
to go back to after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I think he knows a
little bit about the Pearl.
[SPEAKER_06]: The human condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is Neville regretted that he didn't
have all of those varieties that he had in
[SPEAKER_06]: the eighties and early nineties.
[SPEAKER_06]: Later on in life, when he was much,
much better at what he was doing and that
[SPEAKER_06]: they were almost wasted on him when he was
young, just trying to figure it out,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I think is kind of what we all think
in a lot of ways about ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like, Oh, I wish I could
have done that with what I know now,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, back then I was just stumbling
along.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Madjag, when you were getting all that
skunk one and you were talking to Rob
[SPEAKER_06]: about that kind of stuff was, I know you
said that's all you got, but did he talk
[SPEAKER_06]: to you about some of those other lines
that they had and the different stuff that
[SPEAKER_06]: they were messing with?
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned he brought like a whole
selection of weed that put you on the
[SPEAKER_06]: floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd be, did he, did he mention any
earlier?
[SPEAKER_06]: Early girl or early Pearl or any Mexican
or Pollyanna or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that you can remember?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just Afghan number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the other thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He brought a few packets of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I looked back through notes and his
skunk number one packets were two big
[SPEAKER_05]: gelatin capsules with 25 seeds each.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was 50.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each pack was a hundred, but it was 50
was the whole pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he, um, I, I don't know, he,
I was so inspired from reading about this
[SPEAKER_05]: in high times.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I contacted him.
[SPEAKER_05]: When he finally did come the second year
out to our place, came out to Arizona and
[SPEAKER_05]: he stayed for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had his personal stash and this little
zip pouch with individual vials and he had
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-rolled joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he didn't, he had a tie joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a Columbia and he had this and
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He probably had what you're speaking about
Northern lights and various things.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I remember, he had like 10 different
samples in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took one hit of the Colombian that he
had and I just laid on the floor and
[SPEAKER_05]: listened to him talk for an hour in my
living room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't focus really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your honor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to get back though to the
questions you were talking over the
[SPEAKER_05]: concepts you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trying to compare one of these
massively powerful highs that we all have
[SPEAKER_05]: experienced at different times in our
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about comparing them to edibles
today?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't mean edibles that are just
pure TAC.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some edibles that our friends
make or you might make or I've made like
[SPEAKER_05]: cobs or, um, um, cookies, cornbread that
it's, it's full spectrum because you use
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not just trying to get high THC
edibles, which I find not that exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell them at all of the different
dispensaries and rec stores now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash edibles that are just mostly THC
like extract edibles.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but I've had cornbread from my
friends who live 30 miles from here down
[SPEAKER_05]: the dirt road.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, they gave me a square of
cornbread and they said, make sure you
[SPEAKER_05]: only eat a quarter of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't eat more than a quarter of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I took a quarter of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took a quarter of it and cut it in half
and took an eighth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the next day I was in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, well, this will make my day
mellow at work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started driving to work and I got about
one mile away and I realized I couldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drive very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I got pulled over, there's no way
I'd be able to hide where I was at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was weed that powerful back in
the days, you know, in 69, 70 and 71,
[SPEAKER_05]: 72, that you could take a few puffs and
get to that point where you had to hold
[SPEAKER_05]: the railing or you would fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what, but Raho and not so we're talking
about, I know we've all experienced that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I, I like edibles also because they
last all day and you save your throat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have, you know, a special
ability.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like to drive if I'm that high,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have a designated driver,
wow, go to the art museum, go to parties,
[SPEAKER_05]: go to great restaurants and have,
and hold the railing on the way in and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of a lot of ex opiate
addicts will message me because they know
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been through that and I openly talk
about it, you know, and they'll message me
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, did you ever find a strain that
gave you the same effects or similar
[SPEAKER_02]: effects to the high of opiates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that was a good replacement for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing I could say is the
closest I've ever gotten was edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was a similar experience
where someone gave me a tray of brownies,
[SPEAKER_02]: like from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he's like, hey, man, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just only eat like an inch by an inch
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I was a fat kid,
so I was like, this is delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to eat it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was seriously high drooling for two,
three days, like not non-functional,
[SPEAKER_02]: barely alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd have to say that is the closest
I've ever been to just a whole opiate nod
[SPEAKER_02]: off was an extreme case of weed brownies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those struggling with that,
that might be an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles, I mean, they could take you far
and put you out for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The closest I would have to compare to
that in current times is last year,
[SPEAKER_05]: a friend gave me a bottle of coffee
liqueur from Starbucks that he had poured
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis oil in that he had made.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, well, how do you make the oil?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was not really oil as an extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just took fresh buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And boiled them and boiled them down till
it became more of a syrup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he poured it into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, well, how much, what's a dose?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, I just took a swig of it one day
and I laid down and I didn't move off the
[SPEAKER_05]: couch all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still have it in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the closest to have to say it to
morphine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Than anything I've ever experienced in the
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes away pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes you relaxed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do much.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the sad part of it, but it's very
disabling at times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch a movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly it creates, I'm not the most
biggest chemistry guy, but supposedly it
[SPEAKER_06]: creates something in your bloodstream
called THC 11, which is different than THC
[SPEAKER_06]: nine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is my kryptonite.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the sense that when you were like,
Oh, it lasts all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, well, that's the negative for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I'm, I'm stuck all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, like I'm a dad.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my, my ability to just like have days
where I have no responsibility and I have
[SPEAKER_06]: to do nothing are pretty few and far
between.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have had cops behind me, Mad Jag,
where I had eaten too many brownies over
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanksgiving or something at a friend's
house.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought when I got, if I got pulled
over, my only saving grace would be like,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a breathalyzer right now because
I hadn't drank any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, let's just get it out of the
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll blow a zero zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course I haven't done anything,
but if they would have asked me to get out
[SPEAKER_06]: and like lift my leg and touch my nose or
walk in a straight line, I would have been
[SPEAKER_06]: doomed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like no chance I would have been able to
walk a straight line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like all of my motor functions,
it messes with my, it makes me feel drunk
[SPEAKER_06]: in the sense that it, it messes with my
equilibrium and it gives me a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: of the spins and it makes me feel warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have a bunch of friends that tell me
that eventually it'll feel pleasant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, well, how many times do I
have to feel unpleasant before the
[SPEAKER_06]: pleasant starts?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause right now I'm just getting a bunch
of unpleasant, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So when do I break through to the fun
part?
[SPEAKER_05]: In a similar vein, a friend of mine was
driving up from Phoenix to the Verde
[SPEAKER_05]: Valley where I lived at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he was driving along and all
of a sudden his car started going,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then he woke up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was going like 20 in fourth gear and
the car, you know what it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's on the interstate, but luckily that
night, the traffic was very small and he
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't crash and die, which today you
could see.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you couldn't do that behind you that
would just cream into you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is interesting because some people
really, obviously a lot of people like
[SPEAKER_06]: edibles because they're sold all over the
place and at dispensaries and things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say I can smoke any amount
of weed, but I can smoke a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: different kinds of weed and be fully
functional if need be with my day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And edibles, they can take me out and be
like, well, all I'm doing is a whole lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of nothing until this feeling goes away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two daughters, but they're grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, at this point in my life,
I can spare a day if I want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I have, I have, I have a bunch
and they're all needy at this stage of
[SPEAKER_06]: their life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's rare that they don't need anything
from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure, I'm sure you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a great part of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not so, and I'm really happy for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's killer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have, I have four daughters,
you know, and three of them are still at
[SPEAKER_06]: home and they're all, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they all still like me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a positive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might be a glorified Uber and ATM at
this point, but you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, it's, it's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's not everybody likes having
kids, but I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll stick with dogs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dogs for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a, there's a weird thing about my,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This delay is horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a picture up on the screen for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so that bud with the yellow bandana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I, I figure you probably wanted
me to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yes, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's from, that's from my 1982
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, you know, the, the tie and all that
stuff was, was the year or the year before
[SPEAKER_00]: the two, two years before 1980 81,
I grew some seed that a friend of mine
[SPEAKER_00]: brought me from California hitchhiked
around Mendo for, you know, several months
[SPEAKER_00]: and collected, collected seeds every time
he got a ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause everybody there was a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all had weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd smoke and he eat, they'd give him
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that particular plant came from that
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually on his way home from,
from California to for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he stopped at the, at the SFO airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: He walked by a guy smoking a joint in a,
in a Corvette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just kind of walked up to him and
gave him the smile and the guy invited him
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wound up picking up these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the names of the stuff
he brought home and gave me, he would
[SPEAKER_00]: collect these seeds and then bring them
and give them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one of course got the very
intuitive and descriptive name of plain
[SPEAKER_00]: weed because you know, he was about to hop
on a plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, he didn't really know,
you know, besides the names that he would
[SPEAKER_00]: give me for these seeds, which he actually
had a story attached that the,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, this, you know, there was never really
any knowledge about what, what was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't quite the connoisseur that I was
and didn't, didn't read as much stuff as I
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was kind of up to me to
figure out what it was after we grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular plant was,
was an F1 hybrid with Thai and some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of, um, AFI or Pakistan, any, um,
wide leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it was amazing, you know,
that I talked about being an in-school
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension and writing about the Thai
effect that I, that I was experienced a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that, that analysis, that
introspection that, that came from from
[SPEAKER_00]: that exercise came, you know, had become
just, you know, locked in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Thai weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what I knew it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I sat down with this,
with this thing, started smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognized it was like halfway,
you know, the effects were literally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, half of the effect of Thai weed
with, with this, um, kind of sedative
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of, uh, of the Thai, of the AFI or
Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought it was Pakistani because
the leaves looked so different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what your guys' thoughts
are on it, but you know, like when you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys were talking about Thailand and Thai
having like, you know, not all of it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but like, uh, a significant portion of it
had a lot wider leaves than Colombian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that something that, um, do you,
I, I always wondered like, was that,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, you know, do you think that Colombian
and Thai, like, do you think they took the
[SPEAKER_06]: same amount of time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, because I always look at like leaf
width as basically like a genetic thing on
[SPEAKER_06]: like the plant, the, you know,
there's sun panels, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, how much sun does the plant
get?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it needs more sun, it gets wider
leaves to capture it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it needs less, it's a little
thinner, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it doesn't need to as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, you know, and Matt and I and
others, we've had some like long talks
[SPEAKER_06]: about how, like, if you look at Afghans,
if you look at like stuff from like the,
[SPEAKER_06]: the low elevations, um, a lot of that
stuff is like your traditional super fat
[SPEAKER_06]: leaf Indicas.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then if you go up into like the,
the mountains areas, like the Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_06]: type type regions, those Indicas are much
thinner leafed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know if that was like UV or
the sun was stronger, or they just didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: need to have as big solar panels.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but what percentage, like I maybe you
don't know, but like, would you say that
[SPEAKER_06]: like much wider leaves than Colombians or
Panamanians was like a fairly distinctive
[SPEAKER_06]: trait of a lot of ties that you saw?
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see enough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I grew very little of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I, what I saw was, you know,
pictures of the wide leaf tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and people described it, but I never
had any experience with that, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon you're talking about,
you know, wider leaf at lower elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or, you know, related to elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought that the width of the
leaf had something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration, you know, and maybe if
they're an arid environments or humid
[SPEAKER_00]: environments that, you know, that would
affect, but honestly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lebanese tended to be more narrow than
like, say a broad leaf Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think they're in similar
elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it has something to do with
transpiration a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or lack thereof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're protecting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, uh, you know, it, it, uh,
I mean, I was actually talking to somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: from Kentucky, uh, Madjag, who was,
uh, like really getting into like your
[SPEAKER_06]: experiences with, um, with, you know,
on previous uh, shows that we've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was talking about how like in
Kentucky, they could water a patch about
[SPEAKER_06]: your size with a few hundred gallons
because it was so humid there that the
[SPEAKER_06]: soil stayed moist and you didn't really
need that much water to keep the soil wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was like, man, this guy's out there
in the desert and he's pouring thousands
[SPEAKER_06]: and thousands of gallons down there just
to give the plan enough to drink,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but by the time he came back and
I could do the same size patch with like
[SPEAKER_06]: 5% of the water, you know, and that,
that's, I, I basically told them,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's probably like, you know, you grow up,
you're growing in a humid forest and he's
[SPEAKER_06]: growing in an arid desert like environment
to some degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about people who live in Hawaii or
Jamaica where in the rainy areas where it
[SPEAKER_05]: rains every day for an hour, every
afternoon, you know, they, they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigate at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, it's all just natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe with climate change, that's starting
to differ, but traditionally my friend in
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbia, he, he once went down to the
West coast where they used to ship from,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it rained so much that the biggest
problem with growing, they grew tons and
[SPEAKER_05]: tons of wheat, but to dry it, they had to
hang huge tarps up like massive,
[SPEAKER_05]: like tents, like circus tents almost to,
to be able to dry it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no way around it, you know,
and it would probably take a lot longer to
[SPEAKER_05]: dry in that humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nature really, you know, it, it presents,
you know, different benefits and different
[SPEAKER_06]: challenges for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, in the, in the Midwest
where I'm from, you know, they grow a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of corn and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't irrigate it at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're completely dependent on the
weather to come along and just rain on
[SPEAKER_06]: their crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where in the West coast where I live now
in California, it's all irrigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't bring water to it,
you can't grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter what kind of crop you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in Chicago, 20 miles West of
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up and my friend was one of my best
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: One summer got a job with a company that
was eradicating cannabis that was growing
[SPEAKER_05]: wild along the railroads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically since world war two,
when they were making rope out of it and
[SPEAKER_05]: he had a map of all these spots that they
were going to go out to destroy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would go there first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one time it wasn't far from my home.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just growing and we had never
noticed it along the railroads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we harvested like 20 pounds of this
stuff and dried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could smoke an entire joint and
not get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We called it, we called it pretendica.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, you know, this is obviously much
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Later than that, but I would sometimes I
got bamboozled when I was growing up in
[SPEAKER_06]: Chicago and I would buy these very
expensive ounces that were frosty and
[SPEAKER_06]: green and juicy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, Oh man, I'm really getting
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'd smoke and smoke and smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'd be like, this isn't working at
like even as good as the Brown Mexican.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not getting high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had never heard of CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know what it was, but it was
ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just, it was just ditch weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually, there was a thing called a
hemp for victory or whatever, where during
[SPEAKER_06]: World War II, they grew millions of acres
in the Midwest of hemp for, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: everything from, you know, ropes and sails
and, and, you know, duffel bags and all
[SPEAKER_06]: kinds of stuff for the war effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as soon as World War II ended,
they made it illegal again.
[SPEAKER_06]: But after growing that many seeded crops,
it basically permanently in Indiana,
[SPEAKER_06]: in Illinois, some Wisconsin, some Kansas,
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just kind of a permanent thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the government would go out there and
collect money and they would go and
[SPEAKER_06]: eradicate all this like not weed,
but it looked like weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and so they were protecting
society from something that wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I pre-rolled a hundred joints of this in
Hitchhike to California.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the first time I'd been to
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And two guys picked me up in Utah in their
Volkswagen, and then I begged them to give
[SPEAKER_05]: me a ride.
[SPEAKER_05]: They took me all the way to California.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 1200 more miles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in exchange, I gave them the hundred
joints and I said, this is not very good
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told them the whole story and they
said, no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to sell it at the high school
and they'll buy anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got my ride and they got a hundred
joints and that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that 82 crop, you know,
I wound up with that Thai-Afghani or
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai-Pakistani plain weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the smoke told the tale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could absolutely feel the exact same
cerebral, introspective kind of thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: surfing, kind of, you know, floating from
thought to thought, but it had this
[SPEAKER_00]: sedative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made you sleepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the taste was amplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about the Thai
turps, but, you know, there was a citrus
[SPEAKER_00]: that was mixed in with the Thai from the
Indica and the hashiness that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was honestly, it was maybe one of the
best plants I'd ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had it right now, I'd hang up
right now so that I could just smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: myself into an oblivion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, that year was pretty amazing,
82.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had started off in a whole different
state and wound up having a brush with the
[SPEAKER_00]: law that I kind of fast talked our way out
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came back home with a travel
trailer filled with our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my two partners who I was growing
with, you know, after things kind of went
[SPEAKER_00]: bust, they'd had enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to try and do it back at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said, you can have the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spent some time trying to find a
place to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's always the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make the wrong decision and you wind
up behind bars, you know, your life
[SPEAKER_00]: ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some friends of friends wound up coming
to the rescue with a place along some
[SPEAKER_00]: power lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hauled the plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the rest of the summer,
I did like 99% of the work, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: raising these things, this collection of
seed lines from Northern California that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, original stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each line different, you know,
one of them looked like what today we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: call Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one looked like that was from
Mount Shasta that, you know, they called
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like what we think of today
when we say Williams wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just amazingly consistent
morphology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every leaf just like carbon copies of the
other, the symmetry of the branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches and the nodes and the flowers
just like these monstrous freaking balls
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of, you know, on every node.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gorgeous, gorgeous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was a, it was,
it was a season of a lifetime right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately somebody, and you never,
you know, you never really find out who
[SPEAKER_00]: did it, but somebody wound up stealing
half the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed up to water them one day and,
you know, probably two or three weeks left
[SPEAKER_00]: to go and show up to water them and half
the plants are gone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who steals half the plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you walk into something like
that, the first thing you're thinking is,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit, they're probably like watching
me right now because I just interrupted
[SPEAKER_00]: them while they were stealing all the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that, that turns into it's
time to harvest everything right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you take what you've got
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that, that plain weed was really
something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, those, those genetics turned into
the foundation of what I did for like the
[SPEAKER_00]: next, the next six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wound up growing, growing my
own F generations of, of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the best aphes and different hybrids
that I'd made for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, you know,
what, if I'm going to do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what I want to do for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to be a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of like, you know, what Matt,
what inspired Madjag to, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: brand his stuff and go in the canyon and
document what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was all very, very
intentional, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: these days, it just seems so, you know,
almost, almost naive and innocent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that just anything seemed
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the idea that you could,
you could be a pot grower for a living
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, you know, being high times
magazine, like Madjag was, it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was pretty exciting for young kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I went out to Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made arrangements with friends and
connections and wound up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the hills for, for the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the reasons I think
they, they, they let me go out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: join them on the hill was because my buddy
told him about my seed collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, he had collected all the
best stuff from their backyard,
[SPEAKER_00]: sent it out to the East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it, worked it and was now bringing
it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted it, you know, they,
they knew that it was the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, plus I think he kind of portrayed me
as some sort of, you know, young mad
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist that was going to, you know,
teach him something, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I got out there, it was all about
digging holes and, and shutting up and
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that was, it was hard,
you know, being away from home and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that, that just didn't work
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The partnership got very tense and I was
out there for almost three months before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was time I had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, you know, while I was out
there, I went to a July 4th picnic at Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: Kreutzman's house, you know, drummer for
the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1985, basically everybody at this,
at this party was a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my, my partner had rented a
Mustang from the local car rental place to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to this party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, you know, collected a bunch of party
materials for us to enjoy when we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really tell me where it was or what
it was going to, what it was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: until we were sliding sideways down,
down the gravel road off the mountain to
[SPEAKER_00]: get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showed up, you know, did, did my
substances and, you know, it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, it was pretty, it was trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was music and big,
big loud speakers and giant barbecue
[SPEAKER_00]: grills and growers all around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my boys and my boys that I came with
disappeared as soon as we got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, basically I just kind
of roamed around until, until it got late
[SPEAKER_00]: at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it turns out, you know, my,
my partner ran into, one of the guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: had provided the seeds that, that were my
first pure Indica in 1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran into him and it was like,
I desperately wanted those seeds back
[SPEAKER_00]: because when I made my, my F2s or
whatever, I made a bad choice on what
[SPEAKER_00]: female I dusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I put it on the big,
tall giant Indica and instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: little short squat ping pong ball hash
plant Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that that was like,
you know, that little short one was the
[SPEAKER_00]: once in a lifetime plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every year after that, I was
growing these seeds out and every time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as they grew and flowered,
I was like, damn it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: why didn't I dust that other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I, when I saw this guy,
I was like, Oh man, I'll get the,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the original stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get that short plant back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was, he was some sort of Coke head
or something by that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, uh, he didn't, he'd lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd completely lost the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out he'd, he'd stolen the line
from his mother to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a classic, classic Mendo story
there, but I'm sure I'm just having a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time thinking anybody would want to listen
to this much of, of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be, you'd be shocked.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to think that same thing all the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would debate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heavily on like how not to bore the pants
off of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because you got to realize too,
that like most people, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: most people like they'd never lived in
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_06]: They never did outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: They never did gorilla.
[SPEAKER_06]: They never did any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They came on in an era where it was
Instagram and it was this and like,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's like a time capsule and there's
not even really that many good places to
[SPEAKER_06]: go read about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like we were talking about at the
beginning of the show, most people that
[SPEAKER_06]: are talking about this stuff are trying to
sell themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to promote something.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not actually interested in the
history.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're interested in a narrative that
promotes something they're currently into.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, it, uh, it does,
it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about that all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are we not going to bore people to
death?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, like I said, Raho and I talked for
three hours this week and it was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: there was zero planning involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was basically just like friends
chatting about nerd content.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, we, we could have a little bit
more focused chat, I'm sure on subjects,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys, of course, for your time
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll, I'll get all this entity
together and banged out and I appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
