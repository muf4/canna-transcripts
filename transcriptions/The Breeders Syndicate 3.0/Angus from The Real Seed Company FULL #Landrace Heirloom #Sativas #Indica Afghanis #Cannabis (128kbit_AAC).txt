[SPEAKER_05]: I started, I ended, I killed, what's up
with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Got people at once, didn't answer,
what's with my name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevermind, I'm out of my way to save the
world Got a brand new set of words,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're growing great and cheap I'm
gonna stop for a second, questioning,
[SPEAKER_05]: falling Words condescend, just in one
sharp and blunt What's inside my brush
[SPEAKER_05]: that doesn't soften to a punch?
[SPEAKER_05]: I started, I ended, I killed, what's up
with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Got people at once, didn't answer,
what's with my name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevermind, I'm out of my way to save the
world
[SPEAKER_06]: Got people at once, didn't answer,
what's up with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevermind, I'm out of my way to save the
world Got people at once, didn't answer,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's up with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevermind, I'm out of my way to save the
world
[SPEAKER_04]: Got people at once, didn't answer,
what's up with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevermind, I'm out of my way to save the
world Got people at once, didn't answer,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's up with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevermind, I'm out of my way to save the
world Got people at once, didn't answer,
what's up with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking kind of very early 90s and
things with obviously being so close to
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam in England anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were seeing that, people were starting
to grow, but it wasn't the indoor kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: domestic production in the UK didn't
really take off in a big way until the
[SPEAKER_04]: late 90s, early 2000s and suddenly in the
space of a couple of years, imported
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis just disappeared from the UK
completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most imports anyway, if you're in the
UK, unless you knew someone, were pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking shit Moroccan hash to be honest,
throughout the era.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you did know someone, you could
get, you know, nice Swazi red,
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of West African, Nigerian,
and you could still get good Moroccan and
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd see Lebanese, you'd see very seldom
see like really good Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: To get that you'd need to go to Holland or
somewhere to actually find someone who
[SPEAKER_04]: could get the real stuff because most of
what most of the Afghan, Pakistani type
[SPEAKER_04]: hash by that point that you'd see in the
UK was bunk even though people didn't seem
[SPEAKER_04]: to realize, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so, but if we did see like
what we would call skunk and that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff in the early 90s, we'd sit,
I'd sit with my friends around it,
[SPEAKER_04]: their house and stuff and their parents
would just be like, oh, this stuff's
[SPEAKER_04]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you fucking touching all the crap,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just give us this kind of lecture
about how awful it is and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was kind of my perception
anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, you know, friends of mine
who are Australians would basically have
[SPEAKER_04]: the same attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, if they came around and they
saw, and these are getting older
[SPEAKER_04]: generation, you know, if they saw us
growing things, it'd be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: these aren't pure sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need like proper sativas and they'd
rave about Thai and Indonesian and Papua
[SPEAKER_04]: New Guinean sativas and stuff,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So always my perspective anywhere was
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, it was just that was the
natural thing to be interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I did start trying to grow for
myself, I sort of had this realization
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking hell, I know where all these
places are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want these seeds and I can see online
that all these other people are wanting
[SPEAKER_04]: these seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know where to go to go and get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's just a kind of natural
progression, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, you know, it all kind of fell
into place.
[SPEAKER_06]: That takes connections like to track down
like legitimate stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you seem to be quite a well-read
historian of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I can't imagine the links that
you've had to go to, to even bring out a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of this old stuff and a lot of the
land-raised stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say it's sort of partly become
possible because of spending enough time
[SPEAKER_04]: in these places that you get to know
people and they trust you enough,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It really varies though, because some bits
of Asia anyway, it's not really that you
[SPEAKER_04]: need particularly to have connections.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just need to know where the places
are, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you know where the places are
in a lot of the more central Asian parts,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's actually quite a lot easier because
it's really the tropics where it's more
[SPEAKER_04]: tricky because there's no reason to have
seeds in the tropics other than to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not like their food or
something like in Nepal, some of the land
[SPEAKER_04]: raised types anyway, as much as anything
are cultivated for the seeds, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some areas where, and the same
actually, it's kind of true in even in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hindu Kush, you know, is the seeds are a
winter food source as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, this is a really overlooked thing
actually, like even amongst the experts,
[SPEAKER_04]: people seem to realize that cannabis is a
multi-purpose crop in all of the Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: areas, like including Afghanistan and the
Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only bit where it's not a
multi-purpose crop is in the tropical
[SPEAKER_04]: areas where it's ganja, which is,
since to me, the semi-sensi, whatever you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to call it, that's the only where
it's a single purpose crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is only grown for producing the buds,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that makes sense too with the
hash, with the hash production and stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: because they could still collect the hash
and harvest the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, sometimes like I've read
people like David Watson, Sam Skunkman
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, you know, we tried really hard to
persuade the Afghans to like grow the crop
[SPEAKER_04]: as sinsemila and like they just actually
just weren't interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a pretty good reason for that,
which is that actually the seeds are a
[SPEAKER_04]: very important winter food source.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very high in, you know,
important fats and proteins as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then particularly in the mountains,
that's really necessary because obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't keep like huge herds of animals
very easily in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have a few cows and goats and
stuff, but it's not like there's a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: demand for land and water and everything
in any mountain area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, if you can have that extra
source of protein and fats, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: essential, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think like some of the Middle
Eastern places would be super hard to make
[SPEAKER_06]: those connections, especially nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember hearing even Neville's story
back with I think Plive, I think that's
[SPEAKER_06]: what he goes by, when they went to I think
it was Afghanistan and one of them OD'd in
[SPEAKER_06]: a hut and they were, you know,
trying to kick in their door and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how the story went anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can only imagine how crazy it is to
try to get inroads in there nowadays with
[SPEAKER_06]: the political climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one thing I pick up on first is
just in terms of thinking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: geography of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghanistan, I think if you want to have a
kind of clear or just because I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really helpful, you know, with everything
is like context is everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for cannabis, it's really good to get
the geographical and cultural context kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of on a basic kind of map in your mind,
as it were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say Afghanistan is best
thought of as like southern, central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So central Asia rather than the Middle
East is how I would talk about it in this
[SPEAKER_04]: terms, because it's that's the really
central, you know, in what we call
[SPEAKER_04]: Indica's in the sort of loose sense,
colloquial sense, are a central Asian
[SPEAKER_04]: domestica, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Afghanistan is really sort of the
southern edge of central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And rather than the Middle East,
I think if you is it Middle East is
[SPEAKER_04]: slightly more sort of confusing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a confusing term.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, it connects Afghanistan
really sort of connects in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: sense with Xinjiang and places like that,
which is eastern central Asia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bukhara is sort of really, you know,
central central Asia, as it were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are all historically very
connected, important cannabis centers in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of the sort of Indica type races.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, going to those places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, it's been it's been
increasingly difficult, especially with
[SPEAKER_04]: the Taliban being allowed to kind of
retake the entire place and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there is also, yeah,
the fact that other definitely one thing I
[SPEAKER_04]: found going to those bits of the world is
that the culture of kind of opium and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff does mix with the cannabis culture
quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I definitely met characters who were
having problems with things like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, harder substances like heroin
and things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, there's various ways to
do these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, some of the people who were
helping us for a while were stringers for
[SPEAKER_04]: media.
[SPEAKER_04]: And journalism, in fact, all of the people
I know who are from these places who were
[SPEAKER_04]: working as stringers and which means sort
of helping, you know, journalists and
[SPEAKER_04]: media companies who want to make
productions in those areas to meet the
[SPEAKER_04]: people, find the right places doing that
kind of job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they would just have a sideline
in helping collect seeds for us basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then obviously once the once
the Biden sort of pulled the plug on air
[SPEAKER_04]: support for and tech support and
everything for the Afghan army and that
[SPEAKER_04]: just got overrun and most of them had to
then spend the next sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: half a year in like safe houses trying not
to get executed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you a different perspective on
these things because everyone is sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I mean, I was like, you know,
detour too far into politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought the whole that whole post
9-11 adventure was just completely
[SPEAKER_04]: misguided.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like once they've actually
committed to it to then just suddenly
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking turn around and say, actually,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to leave and not even
tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, was just just an astonishing fucking
betrayal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everyone was expecting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's American and that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no sort of just seems to be incapable
of finding a kind of sensible middle
[SPEAKER_04]: ground on foreign policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always going one way or the other too
far.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, we don't nothing to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're all in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we want nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Jesus, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems to fucking affect all the
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaving all the caches of weapons and
whatnot to just to find their their homes
[SPEAKER_06]: to wherever they can do something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crane the way it's going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just give them the entire fucking
anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's it's it's but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean, that's that's mostly what
I've seen of it is the the post 9-11 kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of version of the hippie trail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is quite hard to avoid the political
aspects of it because absolutely
[SPEAKER_04]: transformed by the time I got to see most
of it like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the context in which I saw
people smoking a lot were like security
[SPEAKER_04]: guards and sort of, you know, sort of
those kind of characters like sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: around like with like, you know,
guns and stuff outside places like
[SPEAKER_04]: embassies and hotels and whatever,
you know, very publicly smoking hash and
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like there's sort of there's a whole
martial kind of militant, not militant,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, warfare type context of cannabis
use there and things that I start to
[SPEAKER_04]: whereas, yes, not just a sort of the
hippie trail stereotypes of sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: spiritual use and things are actually just
one side of the culture of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's whole ranges of ways it's used
traditionally that aren't necessarily part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the main Western discourse of like
Oriental cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's part of the story that
fascinates me because it's a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that even as deep into cannabis
history and stuff as I am, that's like not
[SPEAKER_06]: something I'm really super familiar with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't speak on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're the type of person that I can
speak to that has a lot more insight into
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the more people are able to
see all these different perspectives,
[SPEAKER_06]: different ways of thinking about how it's
been used, maybe ways they've never even
[SPEAKER_06]: considered, you know, I think that's
really important to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's like, I think everyone,
you know, we all kind of want to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: know what the roots of the plant are and
where it's come from and things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's definitely been a tendency in
sort of the right on in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: writing about it to favor this idea that
it's to favor aspects of it that fitted
[SPEAKER_04]: with the sort of historical moment of the
60s when it really became a mass
[SPEAKER_04]: phenomenon in the West, you know,
which was sort of the anti-war,
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-racist and sort of countercultural
aspects that were emphasized.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those things like, you know,
the assassins and stuff did kind of creep
[SPEAKER_04]: in there because that was already talked
about quite a lot in sort of Orientalist
[SPEAKER_04]: myths of legends or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, and that does go into the
martial context of use and stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I thought we should go over
early on too, because I mean, the
[SPEAKER_06]: nomenclature is important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even this far in, like, I don't feel
confident anymore, like trying to say what
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a land race is versus an heirloom
versus, you know, anything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to have your your actual working
definitions of some of these things as we
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So people understand what we're talking
about when we say land race and heirloom
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mind field of like different terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, land race is just a really
unfortunate word from my perspective that
[SPEAKER_04]: was a translation that was made in the
sort of late 19th century from various
[SPEAKER_04]: European languages into English from
German terms, Danish terms, whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: like land.
[SPEAKER_04]: In German, it would be Landrasse.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was translated in English as land
race.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas actually, if you were to do that
translation these days, land race would be
[SPEAKER_04]: best translated as country breed or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a defunct form of the word race
that we just don't use anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's completely archaic now in English.
[SPEAKER_04]: Race did once in English have the meaning
of breed, as in the created something that
[SPEAKER_04]: someone has bred has created like a crop
or a breed of animal, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So land races are artificially selected.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're creations by humans for products
that we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're created in certain areas by
farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have an element of region being
region specific and cultures, but they're
[SPEAKER_04]: culture specific and they're absolutely
creatures of human desire and whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're things that farmers have
created for certain products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all land races are product specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tropical land races are specific
for it was looking drug quote,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, air quotes, drug cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tropical land races from places like
India, South East Asia are all
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically for sinsemela slash
semisensei, as in ganja is the traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: term for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the seedless inflorescences or,
you know, very lightly seeded.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that product goes back to at
least the 15th century, perhaps as early
[SPEAKER_04]: as the 12th century in India.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find Sanskrit literature that
describes that technique of roging out the
[SPEAKER_04]: males cutting down the males, how to
maximize resin production by certain
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation techniques and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we call sativas are, you know,
those are what we call sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tropical land race is narrowly
flitted, high THC because they've got this
[SPEAKER_04]: long history of individual plant selection
that's enabled by keeping the seed from a
[SPEAKER_04]: batch of good ganja, you know,
because in practice, farmers don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can find genuinely 100% sinsemela.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is still around even these days in
places like India and Laos and Thailand
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, if you buy a batch
of any significant size of ganja,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will find one or two seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in India, you know, it can be
loads of seeds often, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it shouldn't be like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And historically, it wasn't like that for
the most part, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it goes back that far.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it went back to the 12th century with
selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with cutting down them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so the point is that
individual plant selection is a strong
[SPEAKER_04]: selective pressure and that is enabled by,
that strong selective pressure is enabled
[SPEAKER_04]: by the fact that you do often find a seed
or two in a batch of ganja that you would
[SPEAKER_04]: buy, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So consumers and aficionados and farmers
are all able to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So consciously or unconsciously,
you've got at least 500 years of
[SPEAKER_04]: individual plant selection being a factor
in the creation of sativas, which is why,
[SPEAKER_04]: as any kind of aficionado knows,
they are the strongest forms of land
[SPEAKER_04]: races, Thai, Lao, Burmese, South Indian,
like Kerala.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these types of plants are what went in
to form the real kind of original haze
[SPEAKER_04]: type sativas that people know in the
States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, back in the late 60s,
early 70s, this was literally fetching
[SPEAKER_04]: multiples its weight in gold in terms of
price by the time it got from Thailand to
[SPEAKER_04]: the West Coast of the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the same in England.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look at the custom seizures
records from the early 70s for cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: that was coming from places like Isan in
Thailand, it was testing, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: with thin layer chromatography,
which is not hugely accurate, but it was
[SPEAKER_04]: testing kind of 17% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when it's not gaming the tests
and it's probably sat in a warehouse in
[SPEAKER_04]: London for months, never mind how long it
took to get to England in the first place,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean, we're talking high levels
of potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people aren't making it up when they
say that this stuff could blow your head
[SPEAKER_04]: off, you know, even in the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, you don't need much more
than 10% THC anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it's about the other stuff that's
in these the other phytochemicals that are
[SPEAKER_04]: in these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, to stay focused.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the North, the main group is
what people call colloquially indicus,
[SPEAKER_04]: which the, you know, I guess everyone
knows what I'm talking about, broadly
[SPEAKER_04]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, this is a type of land race
that, you know, with the more semi-dwarf
[SPEAKER_04]: morphology used for making hash,
so product specific, there's no culture of
[SPEAKER_04]: Sin Samila in north of 30 degrees
latitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you've got to the north of
Pakistan, there just is no issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, once you've even got to the
Punjab in India or the Punjab in Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's bisected by colonialism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you've got there, there's no culture
of Sin Samila by the time you even get to
[SPEAKER_04]: the Punjab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you've gone north of the Punjab
towards the foothills of the Hindu Kush,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's absolutely no Sin Samila culture
at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's always been that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you make hash, you pull the seeds
in the process of making the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's not ever been much in the way
of any individual plant selection on hash
[SPEAKER_04]: land races.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're a bulk selected crop that
probably goes back millennia, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: That bulk selection, which is why on
balance the cannabinoid characteristics of
[SPEAKER_04]: Indica land races do lean slightly towards
THC dominant plants, like type one plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: as people will call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you do have in the population a mix of
type one, type two, type three.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, high ratio of THC to CBD is
type one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Balanced THC and CBD is type two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then type three is sort of higher
ratio of CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most hash land races will typically,
if they're a pure land race, we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: not Afghani number one or something you
can buy off a Dutch seed bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're a real land race, they tend to
be like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do lean slightly towards type one
because they've had that history of bulk
[SPEAKER_04]: selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more than random lean towards type
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, if you want to grow a crop of
sinsemila from seed, it's not much use to
[SPEAKER_04]: use a real land race.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to be worked to make them a
sinsemila cultivar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you were talking about the
difference between an heirloom and a land
[SPEAKER_04]: race, heirloom is not a technical term as
far as I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would define it in the context of
cannabis as a land race that's been worked
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically in a Western or modern
context for sinsemila.
[SPEAKER_04]: So X18 or Deepchunk or Afghani number one,
they're all indica heirlooms in the sense
[SPEAKER_04]: they're an indica land race that's been
worked for making sinsemila.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I would define it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got one other group.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the feral varieties then?
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you define those in terms of
land race, heirloom?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it its own type?
[SPEAKER_04]: So feral or wild type is another term you
could use that I think is quite good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't find them much in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a rule, cannabis doesn't naturalize
very well in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a species that is well adapted to
that type of climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do find feral cannabis in the
tropics, it's because you're at altitude
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere with a fairly temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the most part, if you're in,
for example, India, you might find weedy
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis growing like anywhere sort of
north of the Ganges.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking in the sort of top half
of North India between the Ganges and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as you go up towards the
Himalayas, suddenly you'll find areas
[SPEAKER_04]: where it just grows fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just seas of feral stuff, especially if
you go up into Pakistan like Punjab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then up into the mountains around the
rivers and places anywhere where there's
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of disturbed land.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically as a species,
it's a steppe species, meaning it likes
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of windy, fairly dry places where
there's lots of disturbed land.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it grows along the sides of rivers
where animals come to drink and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And stuff like it's high nitrogen,
decent amounts of water, but not rainy,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it tend to lean CBD dominant for
stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically they're kind of like nobody
knows where there's a pure, nobody's ever
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of satisfactorily identified like a
pure wild, like unaffected by humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure wild cannabis plants has never been
found, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you actually have is like parallel
populations that have just been swapping
[SPEAKER_04]: genes with whatever the local form of
cannabis is, you know, in a sense of like
[SPEAKER_04]: humans domesticated at least, I don't
know, kind of say 8,000 years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably we started at least, you know,
unintentionally domesticating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by just bringing it back to hunter
gatherers, like bringing it back to places
[SPEAKER_04]: and where they were eating and stuff,
we're like, we're unconsciously selecting
[SPEAKER_04]: for types that we liked, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then quite happy to grow around our
campfires and stuff, because there was
[SPEAKER_04]: lots of shit and discarded animal bones
and stuff that just are good for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, if you're in somewhere like
the Punjab where it grows, which is sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of north of West India, where there's a
lot of wild ground cannabis, you can,
[SPEAKER_04]: people do like crop the feral,
weedy stuff, provided it's somewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: clean, that's not dusty and things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just crop that and use it for
making food and things, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are high THC in the sense of they
will get you stoned, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like in places like, I don't
know, Wisconsin or somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_04]: States, where it's basically hemp that's
gone feral, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the fiber hemp, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, these are definitely like,
if we're talking, I'll probably make
[SPEAKER_04]: things confusing, but anyway, these are
like in those, in all of sort of central
[SPEAKER_04]: and South Asia, where you get feral
populations is pretty much drug type
[SPEAKER_04]: quotes, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the Himalayas, like people do
sometimes hand rub the feral populations
[SPEAKER_04]: for charis, and it makes people sometimes
called jungly charis, as in like wild
[SPEAKER_04]: charis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, there's a, again,
this is one of those kind of hippie trail
[SPEAKER_04]: type confusions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been this assumption that
Himalayan cannabis is always feral
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, which is it, which it isn't like
99% of the charis that's produced in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Himalayas every year is from domesticated,
intentionally cultivated land races grown
[SPEAKER_04]: in fields by a farmer, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Himalayan cannabis is all wild and
stuff is not not accurate, like in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of the product is just very seldom
produced from the wild weedy stands.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can and people do, but it's got way
less resin production than the actual land
[SPEAKER_04]: races do, you know.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's useless for making sinsemilo,
it's not, because it's all going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: seeded anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't use it for to smoke his butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you do see sadhus doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen sadhus like yogis wandering
kind of yogi characters who've gone to
[SPEAKER_04]: Himalayas and picked a whole load of feral
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they just sit and they kind of
pick out the seeds and mix it with some
[SPEAKER_04]: tobacco and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's it's not like, it's, you know,
it's not designed for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just wipe and rub it for charis
because it's time consuming to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you end up with a product that is
actually going to get you stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas smoking a whole load of feral bud
like that mixed with tobacco, it's more
[SPEAKER_04]: just like a kind of maybe take the edge
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever physical discomfort you
experience as a as a wandering yogi,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's not going to like, get you
particularly high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't have thought unless you've
really just happened to find that
[SPEAKER_04]: unusually strong plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, one of the the interesting
things like from from the American
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective, at least for mine,
is trying like in my mind to define
[SPEAKER_06]: defined expressions between when people
talk about indica types specifically or
[SPEAKER_06]: the broadleaf types, the differences
between like an Afghani type plant and a
[SPEAKER_06]: Pakistani plant, where the the overlap is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, like there's always talk of
Chinese broadleaf types.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never got my hands on any of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember someone made the yunnan
available for a while, but I never got to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow any.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to hear some of your insight on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the major differences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know it's kind of hard to generally
speak on expressions.
[SPEAKER_06]: From whole regions, you know, depending on
the elevation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But is there anything that you've noticed
between, say, Afghanistan and Pakistan in
[SPEAKER_06]: in how they grow?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sent expressions, anything like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's it's particularly difficult
with those northern type central Asian
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghan Pakistani populations, because what
you get if you grow like a first
[SPEAKER_04]: generation of direct from those places
like seeds directly from a farmer in
[SPEAKER_04]: Pakistan or Afghanistan, whatever,
there's a huge amount of variation within
[SPEAKER_04]: the population of one batch of seeds from
one farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the range of aromas you're going to
find in one field from plant to plant just
[SPEAKER_04]: in one of those land races is
extraordinarily diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one plant might be really kind
of like kind of candy shop sweet,
[SPEAKER_04]: tangy aromas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one might smell like like a dog
shit, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's particularly in those northern
populations, that's because they're bulk
[SPEAKER_04]: selected, they're not as genetically
narrow as tropical sativa populations are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So because they haven't had they haven't,
you know, the the genome hasn't been
[SPEAKER_04]: stepped on by farmers doing much in the
way of very consciously intentionally
[SPEAKER_04]: directed breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a huge amount of variation anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of that, in terms of the
difficulty of generalizing, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: because the the assumption amongst
aficionados is that precision,
[SPEAKER_04]: more precision in in your description
means more accuracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, if you get if you get too
precise on these things, you become less
[SPEAKER_04]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's vast amounts of diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So particularly with cannabis,
because it's so phenotypically plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's because like I was saying,
it's a mountain species that's evolved at
[SPEAKER_04]: altitude to adapt to the huge climate
shifts you get at altitude and that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can express itself very differently
depending on where it's planted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you were to plant the same land race
at sea level and then plant it at three
[SPEAKER_04]: and a half thousand meters, exactly the
same batch of seeds from the same farmer,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will see very different plant looking
plants morphologically, because you plant
[SPEAKER_04]: them up high altitude, they're going to
grow much shorter, broader, more broadly,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to pump out way more resin,
probably going to have different
[SPEAKER_04]: phytochemicals, there's probably smell
different and everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And likewise, if you you can get that even
with tropical sativas, if you grow them on
[SPEAKER_04]: well, they're going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow them incompetently,
they're not going to smell so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you kind of have to go to point of
origin to experience them as they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it definitely makes a vast
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with the more genetically narrow
populations like tropical sativas,
[SPEAKER_04]: if they're grown well by someone who knows
how to do it on the right type of land,
[SPEAKER_04]: with the right irrigation timing,
the right feeding timing, the right,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you overwater a tropical sativa late in
flower, it's going to keep growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: keep putting out buds and leaflets,
and it's going to be shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is why you get all this bollocks
talk about 30 weeks of sativas indoors and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just people just keep on fucking
watering it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had that experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, you know, and if you look at
the historical records, it's always,
[SPEAKER_04]: it will tell you this, like in the 19th
century documentation of the ganja farms
[SPEAKER_04]: in Bengal and places, it's like,
yeah, farmers always say the worst thing
[SPEAKER_04]: that can happen is we get rains in like
January, February, and it'll fuck up our
[SPEAKER_04]: whole crop because it will start shooting
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so it's all there if you want to
look and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have blogged about this on the site
as well, if people are wanting to go into
[SPEAKER_04]: more depth and you can find all the
sources and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an amazing blog, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've learned a lot reading through it over
the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad someone reads it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's how I came to know you without
speaking to you a bunch was through the
[SPEAKER_06]: blog and seeing the passion and how you
write and how in depth the detail was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And over time, learning how accurate it
was, which is the most important,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's good to hear, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've shifted most of it now to the actual
main website blog rather than the sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: independent blog because it just seems to
make more sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So generally, I've been kind of moving
everything over to the main blog on the
[SPEAKER_04]: site now just because it seems to make
more sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before I lose the thread of what you
were originally asking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of Pakistan versus
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the thing to bear in mind is like,
seeds move around a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeds move around with people in areas
where people use them as a food and not
[SPEAKER_04]: just for growing as well.
Plus,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, these are artificial political
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no cultural real boundary in
meaningful terms, cannabis wise,
[SPEAKER_04]: between the Hindu Kush in Pakistan and the
Hindu Kush in Afghanistan, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to try to kind of avoid being
sort of bitchy as far as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's all this stuff I see on
Instagram of people talking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: Durand line and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the Durand line, it's just this
fucking bizarre to me as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think most of the kids who are
doing this are like Asians as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like the Durand line was just some
cunt from the UK who drew a pencil line
[SPEAKER_04]: across the boundary between Pakistan and
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck does that have to do with
anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's only in the last kind of 10 years
that they've actually really started
[SPEAKER_04]: policing that border and putting fences up
and things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then it doesn't make the blindest
fucking bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who really wants to get across it
can still do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in cannabis terms, it's just fucking
meaningless.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and seeds have been, you know,
seeds have been moved from Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_04]: down to places like Tehran Valley in
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's plenty of local stories
about the various kind of dervish,
[SPEAKER_04]: like Kalanda Sufi type saint characters
who are sort of credited with bringing
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds into Tehran and things, which at
Tehran is one of the big cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: valleys in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, this whole area is seamless.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole reason the politics and the
history is the way it is, is because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: impossible to police these mountain
borders, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a huge smuggling between these
places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Chitral is another one of the
famous areas like Yakun Valley and things
[SPEAKER_04]: up in the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: These all lead into Xinjiang.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the trade routes that you would
take from Xinjiang, which is the Eastern
[SPEAKER_04]: Central Asian area, this Turkic area of
politically it's inside what's now China.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was the biggest hash producing
region in the world for centuries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this was the epicenter of hash
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wasn't Afghanistan or Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, Xinjiang was until the 19,
late 1930s was the absolute fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: epicenter of world hash production.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, thousands and thousands of tons of
hash were being moved from these places
[SPEAKER_04]: across the mountain passes into India,
because all the money was in Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: India.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the demand for these products was in
Northern India and these huge cities,
[SPEAKER_04]: which even in the late 19th century,
places like Lahore and Delhi had millions
[SPEAKER_04]: of what Lahore certainly had in just the
big Punjabi city had, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: seven, eight, nine, 10 million people or
whatever, even in the 1860s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these were massively massive centers of
demand for these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the production was all happening in
Eastern Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Xinjiang and, you know, the British
were trying to make sure as much of what
[SPEAKER_04]: came into India was being taxed
effectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want too much smuggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as seeds were moving around
between these places, you can read about
[SPEAKER_04]: the people who were responsible for a lot
of the initiation of like commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: production in Xinjiang for India were
often Indians or ethnically from ethnic
[SPEAKER_04]: groups of the mountains of Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so there's just not,
much basis for assuming that there's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be a, you know, there's a very nuanced
picture if you're talking about how these
[SPEAKER_04]: land races in these regions are
differentiated from each other.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get into Pakistan in the northern
mountains, there probably is a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: degree of mixing between kind of the more
sativa type.
[SPEAKER_04]: The further south you move away from the
southern edges of Central Asia,
[SPEAKER_04]: the further south you get away from the
Hindu Kush, there probably is more,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is a higher likelihood that you're
going to have a degree of intermixing with
[SPEAKER_04]: more monsoony type, tropical type,
Punjabi type populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, more hybridization between
sativa type populations and Indica type
[SPEAKER_04]: populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: The further north you go into,
I don't know, into places like Xinjiang,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a higher likelihood, I guess,
of it being a sort of quote, pure Indica
[SPEAKER_04]: type, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look at the plants that were
brought back from Xinjiang in the early
[SPEAKER_04]: 20th century by people like Frank Meyer
and stuff for the USDA, they definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: are very Indica looking plants and yeah,
I mean, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have some of those pictures on your
blog too, correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's no question that
there are these distinct types.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the confusion with the
discussion about are there such things as
[SPEAKER_04]: Indicas and Sativas is like, yes,
there definitely are in terms of if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at pure land races, real land
races, there are these clearly distinct
[SPEAKER_04]: types.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also, of course, some integrating
between them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in pure land races, some land races
are likely to have arisen through mixing
[SPEAKER_04]: of these types.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, once you move into the
context of what you're going to find at
[SPEAKER_04]: most dispensaries or seed banks,
like cannabis internet seed banks,
[SPEAKER_04]: that is, yeah, most of what you're going
to find is Indica to Sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this terminology becomes meaningless in
often most of the time in those contexts,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, an important point, too,
like especially from people that in the US
[SPEAKER_06]: that can go to collectives and stuff and
they're seeing Indica hybrid Sativa and
[SPEAKER_06]: they feel like they have a pretty good
working knowledge of what each is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And quite often, I mean, I don't really
see anything too narrowly anywhere,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, or not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a problem because some that's how
cannabis goes extinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, biodiversity and cannabis
primarily disappears through
[SPEAKER_04]: hybridization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this impulse that most people have to
like hybridize everything when they
[SPEAKER_04]: because it is fun, you know, so I see what
happens.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the most exciting thing you can
do really these days, especially is to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually keep some pristine lines going
that you haven't outcrossed because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: the basis of everything, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once we've got to a point where we've
got a hybridized lines, then it becomes
[SPEAKER_04]: impossible to do breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to go impossible,
but you can't make true F1 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_06]: What have you noticed or maybe haven't
noticed or as far as in those regions of
[SPEAKER_06]: like Afghanistan and Pakistan,
I've noticed there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: popping up, especially on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: As Instagram became bigger, especially for
cannabis and seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you noticed a lot more hybridization
involved, like with modern lines kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: working their way into these lines that
are being declared pure or, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: have you noticed any of that at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I generally try and like just ignore most
of the people doing those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But every every couple of years,
I sort of maybe get curious about what
[SPEAKER_04]: they might be saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's always I mean, the thing is,
I don't like I don't really know what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're up to.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most part, it worries me because I
suspect most of them based on what I've
[SPEAKER_04]: heard have been involved in also bringing
hybrid seed over to places as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, I can't substantiate that
beyond some forum things I saw in like
[SPEAKER_04]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when there was suddenly the 2018ish,
there was this sort of big.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Realization among some of these characters
that, oh, we can get seeds from these
[SPEAKER_04]: places.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, they were sort of
wanting to they were certainly some of
[SPEAKER_04]: them were wanting to bring seeds up to
places like Parvati and Molana,
[SPEAKER_04]: the sort of typical Himalayan areas for
for for chariton India.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, and then I saw these ridiculous
kind of excuses being made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's some kind of wind,
wind climate type microclimate to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: winds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that any pollen from the hybrid
that we bring up to Molana is is not my
[SPEAKER_04]: self-justification.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just after that, I think I wrote a
kind of couple of sort of irritated things
[SPEAKER_04]: back then on the on the on that old blog
and about the amount of bullshit that's
[SPEAKER_04]: spouted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just to put me in a bad mood.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I I don't like going on social media
anyway, much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tends to put me in a negative state of
mind anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just have chosen to ignore it and do
my own thing, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't give anyone an informed opinion
about what exactly is going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up to a point, I know certain outfits have
like stolen stuff from people who supply
[SPEAKER_04]: me, as in as in like, they've supplied
like, I know, I know one outfit that one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the guys who supplies me has sent seeds
to then they didn't pay him and they just
[SPEAKER_04]: knocked off his strain and sold the seeds
and kept the money for themselves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know there's outfits that are that
shitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's, that's like, I can only I only
know that because it's intruded on my
[SPEAKER_04]: world as it were.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't proactively been seeking out
knowledge of what they get up to because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just it's not conducive to being in a
positive state of mind to involve yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: with bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I mean, I mean, to go back to the
plants and stuff like one thing I think is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably worth clarifying for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Himalayan land races, as in we're talking
between sort of, you know, Nepal and
[SPEAKER_04]: Kashmir are a distinct group themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not Indicas.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not true tropical sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're another kind of group within land
races that's very clearly distinct.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're much taller plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They generally are triple use
multi-purpose plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're for seeds, for fibre and for
hashish, charas.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not, you know, they have a,
they can have a profile is typically like
[SPEAKER_04]: a central Asian, you know, a field of them
will break down into like type one,
[SPEAKER_04]: type two, and type three can have anoid
profiles to hemotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're a very distinct group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem with people bringing Dutch
and genetics up to Molina and stuff is you
[SPEAKER_04]: can see it's just that around that area is
very obviously not the same as it was even
[SPEAKER_04]: when I first went there, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very clear that there's that skunky
Dutch kind of effect as not just,
[SPEAKER_04]: not just the smell, the sort of effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there one time and this real kind of
crazy old-timer guy turned up who'd bought
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch of like Thai brickweed with him in
his house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flowing from Bangkok to India.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of hundred gram like brick of
weed from like Cochang or somewhere,
[SPEAKER_04]: Cochang, and just a maniac, you know,
but anyway, he had a bunch of it with him
[SPEAKER_04]: in this guest house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was very interesting, like smoking
some of that side by side with a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: what you could find in Manikaranan places
at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was at least 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the effect of the stuff
from around that end of Parvati,
[SPEAKER_04]: there'd been so much Dutch stuff brought
in by that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: The smell of it was like that real kind of
skunky, pissy, urinal aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was a very un-euphoric buzz
compared to what I associate with that
[SPEAKER_04]: area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you smoke the Thai stuff and it
was really kind of up and zingy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the, you know, yeah, it just
really stood out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, similarly, if you go to areas of the
Himalayas that haven't had that
[SPEAKER_04]: introduction of foreign hybrid seed,
the effect of the charising, the sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: unfashionable bits of the Himalayas to go
to is the old school real stuff that's not
[SPEAKER_04]: been obviously fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The effect of it's much nicer,
you know, it's like much more uplifting
[SPEAKER_04]: and positive feeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's rarely something with skunk one in
it that I can smoke because it always
[SPEAKER_06]: takes me to a very specific, like negative
space in my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: So usually I can pick it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's taken a long time, but I can pretty
much like, yeah, pick out anything that
[SPEAKER_06]: has skunk one in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's very few exceptions that I find
something I love, you know, that has that
[SPEAKER_06]: in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least, you know, 50%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the, anyway, most of the
continuations of it have been selected for
[SPEAKER_04]: the sort of heavy side of it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's mostly in the UK, if you get
something skunky, it's anyway,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be like a Hindu push skunk,
Afghan skunk, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so it's doubly like leaning that
way anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing to bear in mind as well,
is that like, that's not anyway the,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you look in Afghan land races
themselves, Hindu Kush land races,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever that whole zone, they're not
necessarily like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not necessarily sedative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of them clearly are
predominantly like that, but there's such
[SPEAKER_04]: a wide range of phytochemical,
you know, chemo type, whatever that you
[SPEAKER_04]: get in these populations that aren't going
to give you that type of effect as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no, we're not kind of stuck
with this as long as we keep the some good
[SPEAKER_04]: representations of like pristine land
races in storage, you know, there will
[SPEAKER_04]: always be the possibility of creating new
things that actually feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is, you know, it gets back to your
original question of like, why did I get
[SPEAKER_04]: into this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, a lot of people, the sort of
standard narrative is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the UK, the standard narrative is,
oh, around the year 2000, suddenly all
[SPEAKER_04]: this hybrid stuff arrived and it was just
too strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, not really, I wouldn't say
it was too strong was the issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: The effect was just, it wasn't very
fucking nice, you know, a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people didn't stop smoking
because it was too strong so much as it
[SPEAKER_04]: was just a dysphoric effect from so much
of it compared to what they were used to
[SPEAKER_04]: from the traditional stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mostly what people say, oh yeah,
it used to make me paranoid and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, the assumption is that
that's because it's just too strong,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's not necessarily that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have very strong probical sativas
that primarily don't make you feel
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly paranoid, you know.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's widely talked about
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just too strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, actually you can have a
plenty of, you know, strong highs of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis that are really nice,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they don't evoke a paranoia and all
that other shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, general kind of grabby, dirty
feeling that you kind of get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I mean, it's not, you know,
again, I'm always very wary of talking
[SPEAKER_04]: myself into a corner of doing kind of
anti-modern stuff, which I'm not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I'm just pro kind of pro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pro diversity, pro possibility,
which is why I think it's worth preserving
[SPEAKER_04]: as much as we can of what is left of these
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that there is that option in the future
of taking the plant down different routes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a sort of default assumption that
we've already arrived at the pinnacle of
[SPEAKER_04]: what can be achieved in cannabis that was
so much a part of the last 10 years of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis discourse, this assumption that's
like, yeah, you know, these elite cuts and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff are like the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, I'm not sure, but it's sure
as fuck on like the all there is to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: to be achieved, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to explain to people a lot of the
quote unquote elite cuts in the U S like
[SPEAKER_06]: most of those are picked out of two,
three seeds, you know, like in someone's
[SPEAKER_06]: closet, like, I mean, elite's definitely,
uh, it's very rare that I find any of
[SPEAKER_06]: those old clones that have been passed
around that everyone universally agrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so rare to ever find that,
you know, there's very few.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, the, the clone market in the U S
has been completely taking over lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that spreading of HLV.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of like the past few seasons of
what I've been doing is trying to explain
[SPEAKER_06]: to people the necessity of seeds versus
clones as well in the U S.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that a bunch of the Spanish or
Spanish clones or stuff from here that
[SPEAKER_06]: went over there has murdered some of the
libraries over there of some of the old
[SPEAKER_06]: Dutch stuff that they had been keeping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's not slowing down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not slowing down anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't, I wasn't aware that this is the
hot blatant virode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just basically fucked everything up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a scenario where we're paying the
price of how fucking homogeneous all of
[SPEAKER_04]: our stuff is already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hadn't realized it had actually got
to the point of like trashing people's
[SPEAKER_04]: collections as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, with one of the bigger clone nurseries
that I know of and they'll remain
[SPEAKER_06]: nameless, but, um, they are pretty content
with 3% of clones going out with HLV
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's so inundated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's assumed that 3% is, is the best that
they can do not 0%, but 3% is like
[SPEAKER_06]: winning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are constantly testing constantly
because they're still bringing stuff in
[SPEAKER_06]: because everybody wants this cookies
renamed, whatever the new name for cookie
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff is today, you know, and,
and it's still working on people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, um, the education is out there,
but it's, it's not being accessed or
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe, you know, there's a big difference
between smokers and growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a, there's a wide pool that just,
it's really hard to get through because
[SPEAKER_06]: most people that I've encountered here,
the attitude is why do you care so much?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just weed, you know, that's like a
very standard British attitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's all just weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, um, Americans coming over to the UK
are just like, uh, you know, when they see
[SPEAKER_04]: what's available to someone who is just,
uh, randomly turning up in England,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's, it's dismal, you know, unless you
grow for yourself and we happen to be in a
[SPEAKER_04]: city that's particularly like weed
orientated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very dismal, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, I, I, that's,
that's this, this is what I've always had
[SPEAKER_04]: in mind is that, you know, there,
there is going to come a point and I had
[SPEAKER_04]: run across the HLV issue, but it's not
something that impacts me directly with
[SPEAKER_04]: the way I'm operating.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't been looking into it,
but it was always, it's going to come a
[SPEAKER_04]: point where something's going to come
along that's just going to fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: decimate, um, the situation and people are
going to realize just how fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: homogenous everything is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so based on such a small handful
of, for the most part, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Dutch and American lines, you know,
there's, you could probably count them on
[SPEAKER_04]: two hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I expect the main contributors to the,
um, um, and, and, and people don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: people, especially sort of below
generation X don't really have any sense
[SPEAKER_04]: of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, unless they're nerds,
you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: unless you grew up in, in the sort of
pre-hybrid era or happened to be into
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in the actual growing side of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason why you'd necessarily
realize, you know, it's one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: problems as well, um, with, uh,
groups who are doing collecting is a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of them, I can tell, uh, not from an age,
uh, from a generation where they're
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily even going to know what a pure
land race looks like in Thailand or
[SPEAKER_04]: Cambodia or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, something that to me would be so
obvious that it's been hit with something
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch or American.
[SPEAKER_04]: They genuinely might not even realize that
I've had people contact me saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm in Cambodia or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found these great plants and it's like,
yeah, they do look like pretty cool
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, but I can tell from just a photo
that they're not lacking in, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghan and, uh, just don't realize,
you know, they're still, they're still
[SPEAKER_04]: worth collecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, but it does, it does matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: The difference between them and the
pristine population does matter,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, um, there's no reason like why
they're, that they're not like bad per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that they are introgressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're down the route of total
modernization.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're well down that route already.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not, not even half as valuable
as the real thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's well put.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have a lot of experience with,
uh, maybe Southeast Asian is correct with,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, Thai and Lao.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've, I've heard, you know, some of the
stories that, uh, it was Laotian farmers
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing down stuff to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is, um, is there any veracity to that or?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's more the, um, the, um,
I mean, the, the thing to bear in mind is
[SPEAKER_04]: again, like it's, it's, it's really
important, like really worth, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: bearing in mind is that these political
boundaries, uh, uh, uh, very modern
[SPEAKER_00]: creations for the most part that don't
have any real significance in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the culture of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, if you picture the,
if you picture the Mekong kind of running
[SPEAKER_04]: from up in sort of the East of Tibet down
into Southeast Asia from, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: through the golden triangle and down
through Thailand and down towards
[SPEAKER_04]: Cambodia, all along the Mekong,
either side of the Mekong is, is basically
[SPEAKER_04]: ethnic Lao anyway, once you get into
Thailand and, and Lao.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, large chunks of Thailand are like
Isan where, which is the famous,
[SPEAKER_04]: the famous Thai stick areas of Thailand
are all ethnically Lao anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it wasn't really a question of people
bringing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's just that the culture,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, if you look at the early
historical, uh, writing in so far as there
[SPEAKER_04]: is, any in, um, Thailand about cannabis,
um, I think there's some from the sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: 18th century or 19th, I think we more 19th
century, some of the earliest references
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've seen people find found,
uh, to ganja and cannabis in Thai
[SPEAKER_04]: literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It, the, the, the, the Thai writers are
very much emphasizing that this is a Lao
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was in the context.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the really early references is in
the context of a kind of historical epic,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, which is a, about the, uh,
huge war between the Lao, uh, kingdom and
[SPEAKER_04]: the Thais that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, basically, I think it was 1830s,
maybe I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't quote me on the dates,
but not super long ago, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, the Lao kingdoms got quite
expansionists, uh, under a guy called Jiao
[SPEAKER_04]: An, I think it was they, um, got
ambitious, tried to sort of seize bits of
[SPEAKER_04]: Lao and in return, the Thais basically
just annihilated, uh, Vientiane and all
[SPEAKER_04]: the big cities of, of Lao particularly,
like literally raised it to the ground,
[SPEAKER_04]: moved all of the population into Isan,
into Thailand across the Mekong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, because they wanted to have more
people there because it was one of the big
[SPEAKER_04]: problems the Thais have always had is that
the population density was too low for
[SPEAKER_04]: them to sort of, uh, tax farm the,
they wanted more people there to tax
[SPEAKER_04]: basically for the state to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, yeah, so it was a kind of,
um, the reason there's a very big Lao
[SPEAKER_04]: population in Isan is partly artificial
basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a lot of people moved and,
um, the, um, the culture from a very early
[SPEAKER_04]: that all the indications are is that the
cannabis is associated in Thai culture
[SPEAKER_04]: with, uh, rural, um, populations,
particularly ethnic Lao populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a very, very strong,
uh, status association in the Thai culture
[SPEAKER_04]: is very, very status conscious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's worse than the English or any
kind of snobby culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the, all of the politics of Thailand
are all about the big city, Bangkok versus
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the, the countryside basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this, the reason I'm giving all of
this kind of context is that it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: surprising to me at all, as someone who
knows these various fairly well,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not surprising to me that the law has
been changed back in Thailand now to ban
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did they change it back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to buy sometime this,
I forget, they've got a few more months or
[SPEAKER_04]: perhaps, and then they're going to just
ban recreational use again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another question about whether
they'll actually be able to enforce that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, at this stage, but the absolutely
no surprise to me at all whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the, the, the consensus has been that
in the Bangkok elite, that this should not
[SPEAKER_04]: be allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and they're going to do what the
British have done.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to basically copy our model
of like allowing some medicinal industry
[SPEAKER_04]: that them and their mates will get to cash
in on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the kind of industrialists and elite
will get to make a killing out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal industry, but, and everyone else
can go fuck themselves and get a
[SPEAKER_04]: prescription or go to jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not much different than the
U S like it really ended up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the same, it's the same sort of
whatever dialect it, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: say this cause it's basically cannabis is
a, is a, is a, is a peasant drug basically
[SPEAKER_04]: in, to put it in bluntest terms in,
in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that some people have some
elite establishment types have a kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: affectionate attitude towards it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh, it's the country bumpkin kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people look down on it, disdain for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's the definite hierarchy,
you know, in terms of things like
[SPEAKER_04]: amphetamine, and opiates and stuff in
Southeast Asia that's about elite versus
[SPEAKER_04]: rural poor man's drug, rich man's drugs
and various in between.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and cannabis is definitely the poor
man's drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, it's part of the culture
quote unquote, but it's much more
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated than that in Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to have a kind of sense of how.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stratified and fractured all of these
countries are in terms of the culture and
[SPEAKER_04]: the geography and how that relates to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not straightforward.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not straightforward that
they're going to legalize in India by any
[SPEAKER_04]: means.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it is very strongly connected to
how the political establishment relate
[SPEAKER_04]: towards the, uh, minorities and village
communities in terms of how they see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's all kinds of complicated ideas
about smoking versus eating it and which
[SPEAKER_04]: is smoking is generally not okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe eating it's kind of okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's so, it's not at all the
question that it's like, um, the shorthand
[SPEAKER_04]: that we in the West tend to go for like,
uh, the Americans came and banned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, but no, not really that they were
moved to ban these things long before the,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, uh, American hegemony or whatever it
was a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and a lot of the, the,
the, um, British involvement, ironically,
[SPEAKER_04]: was strongly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lent towards not making it illegal because
the British were there to make money in
[SPEAKER_04]: India places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the loudest voices who were pushing
for it to be made illegal were generally
[SPEAKER_04]: Indians of a certain establishment type of
mentality.
[SPEAKER_04]: In India that regarded this stuff as
unacceptable, you know, and that was
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing to do with, uh, them being
contaminated by puritanical Western ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were like locally born ways of
thinking about these substances that
[SPEAKER_04]: associated them with undesirable groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like cannabis was very strongly associated
with Muslim culture in India, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly the smoking hashish was
associated with Muslims.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as far as it had any Hindu
connections, it was associated often with
[SPEAKER_04]: village forms of Hinduism that were seen
as being, um, sort of folk versions of
[SPEAKER_04]: Hinduism that were not sophisticated and
all were contaminated with, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you know, unorthodox forms of Hinduism
that were disapproved of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so there's all kinds of like nuances in
there in terms of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, it's not, it's the
pessimistic but I can't, I'm not like
[SPEAKER_04]: anticipating some glorious future age of
legalization that's going to be around the
[SPEAKER_04]: corner, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a while where I thought maybe,
maybe because the money will decide it and
[SPEAKER_04]: then I'm like, no, it's not, it's not
going to, I don't think we're going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: like living in some global legal situation
anytime soon basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seems like no matter what happens,
it's always going to be putting the hand,
[SPEAKER_06]: the, the money into the hands of the few,
maybe opening it up, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: built this market, but closing it back
down puts it back into the 1% type
[SPEAKER_06]: situation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's pretty difficult once,
yeah, basically I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once it's been, once you've got a
prohibition scenario, like extricating
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself from that, you know, it's not
straightforward, especially when there's
[SPEAKER_04]: such a strong plutocratic sort of
oligarchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like tendency in, in, in our dysfunctional
democracies these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, when you combine that with how
difficult it is to have a sensible
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion about these types of topics in
the, in the media these days, it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, it's, it's very tricky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's people in the USA that,
you know, applied for licenses and
[SPEAKER_06]: because, and didn't end up getting it for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now they're on paper and now they
get rated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's, yeah, it's, it's been wild to
watch it happen over the past,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, however many years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't imagine it's going to get any
better anywhere after people have watched
[SPEAKER_06]: the rich sort of take over the whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know, like, I was very
optimistic, not optimistic, but I was kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of cautiously optimistic that like,
even if it wasn't for the right reasons,
[SPEAKER_04]: we might end up with legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, and the quirks of the
political system in the States where you
[SPEAKER_04]: can have these sort of referenda and
stuff, referendums in places like Oregon
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever that we don't have anything
like that in the UK equivalent to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was sort of watching somewhat
enviously and thinking, yeah, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's only a matter of time before you've
got federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed Harris has been saying she's
going to do that and things, who knows,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I mean, maybe they will,
but it does require like some courage on
[SPEAKER_04]: the part of people in power to actually do
what they know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to any of these people,
they will know what they should do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they'll always do sort of some sort of
half-hearted fudge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, the chance of like
having sensible laws about actually kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of properly dangerous drugs is very
unlikely anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And particularly given that even the sort
of more enlightened discourse around these
[SPEAKER_04]: things is so incapable of, you know,
I'm thinking like, you see all this talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about psychedelics these days and
psychedelics this and psychedelics that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, yeah, okay, but you know,
we're going to legalize all these things
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we're going to leave like the
actual shit like fentanyl and heroin and
[SPEAKER_04]: meth or whatever that actually is really
what you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to change the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were actually concerned about not
having all these people dying and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's like, you know,
cannabis exceptionalism, psychedelic
[SPEAKER_04]: exceptionalism and all this stuff is like,
there's a whole other conversation,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't see it's going to feature
anytime soon in the sort of any serious
[SPEAKER_03]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, you know, I just recently
learned that in Oregon, because someone
[SPEAKER_06]: got busted there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds, seed sales and stuff is is a
serious felony.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do, you're not like, you know,
fully legal with paperwork and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, dude went to jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it blew my mind because when I think
of Oregon, like when I visited,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's very open cannabis wise, much more
open than where I'm at in California,
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously, like, I'm not up to speed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it like it seemed pretty,
I don't know, normalized there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the seeds, if you're not legal,
you know, you don't have all your
[SPEAKER_06]: paperwork in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot more serious penalties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very tricky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I so sort of so like come this such a big
gray area with all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, in the UK itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally uncontrolled in terms of moving
the seeds in and out of the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's zero regulation on it,
like literally none.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, it's.
[SPEAKER_04]: As in to leave the borders of the UK and
come into the UK, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, for the destination countries,
this becomes infinitely more complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: But absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so it's so it's so so surreal.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the thing, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I tend to repeat myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just steer me onto something else if
I'm getting boring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weird thing is with the UK is it's not
historically actually been a country that
[SPEAKER_04]: has tended to to prohibit stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, like narco colonialism was
one of the most controversial aspects of
[SPEAKER_04]: our history in terms of things like opium
and and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the colonial history and periodist
history of the UK was drugs are a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The the elite discourse of this
establishment figures, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of liberal, old school liberal kind
of 19th century, 18th century liberals for
[SPEAKER_04]: the most part, just like insofar as they
knew about these things just didn't give a
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, well, that's something they
do there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we make money out of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, subject, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the UK itself, like,
you know, heroin was available on
[SPEAKER_04]: prescription as late as the the 19 19 late
1960s.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you could still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was regarded as a as a opiate
addiction was a medical thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The notion that it should even be
considered criminal was completely just
[SPEAKER_04]: anathema to the whole way it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, people like William
Burroughs and all these kind of type
[SPEAKER_04]: characters would come to the UK and stuff,
you know, because it was so because it was
[SPEAKER_04]: such a common sense culture towards these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they obviously went off the rails
dramatically by the 70s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And partly for actually kind of historical
reasons, not necessarily to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: America per se, but it was largely sort of
American led the move towards a more
[SPEAKER_04]: aggressive prohibitionist stance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, you know, even our sort
of I think it's probably the same in the
[SPEAKER_04]: states now, like, doesn't matter how far
right you go, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people in the conservative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Politics in the UK, if you talk to them on
a personal basis, even publicly now would
[SPEAKER_04]: be like, yeah, of course, it shouldn't be
criminalized, should be legal,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much different than the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I maybe maybe politicians on the
right would say that privately,
[SPEAKER_06]: but definitely not publicly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's a religious thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that I'm not sure if it's a religious
thing because our country is so religious
[SPEAKER_06]: based or what the difference is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was definitely one of the major
dividing lines between the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and the UK was that there was a strong
disapproval of British imperialism,
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly in Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in World War Two, the Americans
were just very openly like, why the fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: should we even be helping you guys keep
control of your colonies?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, ignoring the hypocrisy of the
Philippines and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the attitude was that and it was even
before then that the League of Nations,
[SPEAKER_04]: when the first kind of international
attempts at prohibition happened,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're talking kind of 1920s and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Americans and the Egyptians who
led the move to kind of include cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: on all of the anti-opiate laws,
which were the real driver of the first
[SPEAKER_04]: attempt to like internationally prohibit
drugs through the League of Nations to pre
[SPEAKER_04]: UN type idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the American and Egyptians who
would really led the charge, especially to
[SPEAKER_04]: get cannabis included on the on the laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ironically, that was using data from
the quotes, lunatic asylums of Egypt that
[SPEAKER_04]: the British had actually put together
because they were kind of doctors and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff within the imperialist machinery who
focused on this idea that cannabis caused
[SPEAKER_04]: insanity and that it was associated with
criminality and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was partly British material like the
research that supported the idea was used
[SPEAKER_04]: to support the idea that cannabis might
somehow make you insane or was associated
[SPEAKER_04]: with violence and criminality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically because the British,
even though they didn't want to ban these
[SPEAKER_04]: things in India, were still quite happy to
use the association between cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: like marginal groups, you know,
groups of men hanging out on the street in
[SPEAKER_04]: parks and in urban centers like laborers
and stuff smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they were quite happy to kind of
police these groups using or to control
[SPEAKER_04]: these groups using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some kind of radical dervish gets
conscripted into some army unit and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: causing problems in the barracks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he smokes hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put him in the lunatic asylum.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was still exploiting it to control
undesirable people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was this kind of paper trail
associating cannabis with mental illness
[SPEAKER_04]: that was used as early as the 1920s to
kind of shoehorn cannabis into the
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-opium laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could dig into this with you forever,
but I definitely want to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_06]: go over some of what you have in stock
because I'd love to have you on,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, whenever you have more time too,
because like I said, each one of these
[SPEAKER_06]: topics, like you could really open it up
and talk about it forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what fascinates me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what I know least about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, far away like because it's better if
you give me some questions so that I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: just drift back onto stuff that some
people would have heard me talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's start with one of the ones I had
experience with was from the Highland Thai
[SPEAKER_06]: Burmese.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was called when it was first
released.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that one's I thought that was an
amazing like a plant that could be done
[SPEAKER_06]: well indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how it would compare to,
you know, point of origin, but it could be
[SPEAKER_06]: done well indoor in the USA.
[SPEAKER_06]: What can you tell me about that line?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that has been through a couple of like
ex situ maintenance grows now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to I haven't directly been
involved with that since I originally
[SPEAKER_04]: collected the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many there may have been inevitably
going to have been some possible shifts in
[SPEAKER_04]: what it actually is now, just from the
fact that, you know, we can't do more than
[SPEAKER_04]: like double digits in total plant numbers
of maintaining it realistically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got it from in Mahon Son from a guy
who an expat guy who was based up sort of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, very near the border with Burma,
and they were Hill tribe groups who had
[SPEAKER_04]: got hold of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's difficult to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I hopefully will be finding out soon,
based on genomics analysis of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: what exactly is in the mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I suspect it may have a bit of
hybridization with more like kind of East
[SPEAKER_04]: Asian hemp lines in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just a pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a simple kind of pristine
ganja land race.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a tie like Shan is another
name for them kind of groups up in those
[SPEAKER_04]: areas, who definitely have a culture of
growing cannabis for themselves sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: like it was a real problem for this friend
of mine, or rather, you know, not friend
[SPEAKER_04]: of mine, but guy I met who was growing up
there, he, he would do this kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: gorilla grows with tropical, you know,
really nice like tropical lines,
[SPEAKER_04]: like kind of a carrier haze and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the plants would get to like,
you know, within like a couple of days,
[SPEAKER_04]: just being just right, you know,
and he goes out to cut them down and just
[SPEAKER_04]: find some shangai has come and just taken
the whole lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like exactly when it's just like a point,
you know, it's like, because they really
[SPEAKER_04]: know exactly how to grow it themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, they're waiting for the
perfect moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: The day before he goes out to get them,
take the whole fucking lot scared me about
[SPEAKER_06]: gorilla grows is yeah, like here they say
plant one for you plant one for the cops
[SPEAKER_06]: plant one for the thieves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thieving is not great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that the but yeah, so I think
they were not who the actual guys he got
[SPEAKER_04]: the seeds from that la who kind of like,
Moussa is another name for them that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of a minority group who are around those
border regions a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, you know, hill tribe would
be the kind of people would use they and
[SPEAKER_04]: they move across the borders between China
and Burma and Laos places quite readily.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think they were growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got hold of some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is around there,
there's a quite a lot of cultivation of
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber types, land races as well in those
areas, particularly because it's been
[SPEAKER_04]: encouraged by the Thai government.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is quite a high chance that
there's been hybrid hybridization between
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: My experience of it was it was not like a
highly potent compared to what you can
[SPEAKER_04]: have in land races.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then the very tall plants as
well plus the hollow stem tendency made me
[SPEAKER_04]: think like, quite possibly there's some
hybridization happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's certainly other lines where
that's plausible that that's happened,
[SPEAKER_04]: because they are grown on grow cycles as
the hemp and hemp and ganja are grown on
[SPEAKER_04]: the same growth cycles quite often in
those areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's possibility of crossing between
populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so I was just thinking about it,
like, asking you to explain any of the
[SPEAKER_06]: scent profiles and stuff like that,
but it really doesn't translate like,
[SPEAKER_06]: because like you said, it's a very
plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't want to in the sense that like,
the nuance is so hard to get right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I saw them, like he deliberately had
bought down like to the two kind of main
[SPEAKER_04]: expressions of that Thai land race that I
mean, it may be something totally
[SPEAKER_04]: different from what the high and Thai that
goes around in America under the same
[SPEAKER_04]: name, by the way, it was probably I
shouldn't have used that name for it's
[SPEAKER_04]: just as the confusion, but he brought down
like a very much more kind of light green
[SPEAKER_04]: and light green and the purple batch of
the land race and the purple batch was
[SPEAKER_04]: much more kind of down the mango charity
and the smell, smell types and then the
[SPEAKER_04]: light green I much preferred was more kind
of like, it's really hard to describe,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was some citrus but not like
straightforwardly, it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: very kind of musky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard to describe smells,
but it was a much more compelling smell
[SPEAKER_04]: for me and I'm sure would be the
preference.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was working the line was that that
side of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other thing, the reason I suspect
some Chinese hemp type, East Asian hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: type is the leaves could be very broad,
not like with the Indica shape per se
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily, although I need to actually
look at them again to see where the
[SPEAKER_04]: broadest point is on them, but they just
anyway look like something quite distinct
[SPEAKER_04]: from the real kind of classic Lao,
East Asian type.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of these questions we've actually
covered as a course of just conversing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one, I mean, like almost all of
them we covered just by conversing,
[SPEAKER_06]: but one that I think will be probably the
most asked question you'd probably when
[SPEAKER_06]: you get a lot is from CCC and he asked how
to keep pure, well, pure, relatively pure
[SPEAKER_06]: sative is manageable indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any advice on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one of the main tricks people do
that I'm aware of is you can use pot size
[SPEAKER_04]: to just control and like, because if it's
really like a pure straight from a farmer
[SPEAKER_04]: type sativa, they're going to keep rooting
even during flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can just pot up in the kind of
second week of flower or so still,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you should find that it will still
root into the new compost, which can be
[SPEAKER_04]: good as well, because it can mean that you
don't make the mistake of like overfeeding
[SPEAKER_04]: too much during flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing with sativas indoors
is to try to not overwater them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a really important aspect of,
of traditional farming of, of ganja.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it seems to me that whatever is
the right irrigation schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even these days, the good quality
production in places like Laos and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: is in areas where they've got access to
lakes or ponds or streams to irrigate on
[SPEAKER_04]: schedule rather than just allowing rain
fed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, the main good quality
crop is done from sort of sowing in mid
[SPEAKER_04]: August ish and then harvesting kind of
February ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you September ish or whatever to
February, March ish, basically six months
[SPEAKER_04]: over the starting at the end of monsoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have a bit of rain whilst the
plants are in veg, but really once you're
[SPEAKER_04]: into flower, you're looking to like have
zero rain ideally and just have
[SPEAKER_04]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mistake people make indoors is to
overwater.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already kind of touched on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other thing is you can,
if they're a real land race, you can prune
[SPEAKER_04]: back pretty heavily if you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can, you can, you can concentrate
the bud production into the exactly where
[SPEAKER_04]: you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you prune prune carefully and you can
prune like quite late on in the cycle of
[SPEAKER_04]: growth still.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't think of other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest with you, I'm not like an
expert grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know from talking to people and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have like a huge amount of
opportunities to grow because of the
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of moving around I do, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can imagine that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, they're not well adapted to
indoors basically as the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will, you know, the type of land
they want to be on is a really important
[SPEAKER_04]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the big ganja growing areas of India
in the late 19th, 30th, 20th century,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was quite a good documentation done
of that whole economy because it was
[SPEAKER_04]: economically very significant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the land along the rivers along the
Ganges Delta area that was very loamy,
[SPEAKER_04]: like light, sandy loams that don't hold
water too much but are very nutrient rich
[SPEAKER_04]: were really sought after by people who
wanted to get into commercial production,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were techniques which are still
used of how you prepare the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, still they'll do this still
in Southeast Asia as you create ridges,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like raised beds, like a kind of
semi circle type shape with between them
[SPEAKER_04]: for the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you plant on top of those half
circles, as it were, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So curved raised bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that means that the water runs off
the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the thing you're just trying to avoid
is to have the roots sitting in
[SPEAKER_04]: waterlogged land because that cannabis
just does not fucking like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will get infected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are all kinds of parasites and
pathogens that were already very well
[SPEAKER_04]: known back in that time, which are even
kind of specific forms of powdery mills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, these conversations
sometimes with people who are like using
[SPEAKER_04]: these, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Natural, sort of, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some kind of like people basically growing
in this like composting compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even properly composting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Korean natural farming stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get these kind of emails from people
sometimes and I try and like be as nice as
I can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: On principle, I'm all for kind of
permaculture and anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jesus, man, like cannabis does not
want to be in that kind of fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy writes to me like, yeah,
I've created this amazing system where
[SPEAKER_04]: like the soil is wet 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think over the last 50, 60 years,
like cannabis in the West has adapted to
[SPEAKER_04]: all kinds of maltreatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, yeah, you don't want to be
growing a land race in like soggy,
[SPEAKER_04]: incredibly rich compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially not with like stuff literally
rotting on the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's like, can you send me like a
photo?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says this thing is like fucking
cooch grass, like growing in the same pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each to their own, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, God bless them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel I should just tell them like,
no, just don't grow this type.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any strange you want to highlight
that you currently have for sale right
[SPEAKER_06]: now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or any anything else you want to talk
about and get in?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm really interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I collected a bunch of stuff from Arissa,
which is sort of just south of of Bengal,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I suspect is quite historically
significant in terms of the development of
[SPEAKER_04]: sativas, like real tropical sinsemila land
races.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we were talking about,
there's that book, the kind of alchemical,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's an alchemical book, actually,
the Iron and the Cunder is the name of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they describe the sinsemila
technique that's from around there,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of Andhra Pradesh, Arissa area was
where that was probably compiled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I suspect those plants are pretty
interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem to be like probably more like
five months from seed to harvest the ones
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then planning to have some Nepali
ganja land races available soon as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think will be pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just in terms of product stuff,
like I'm a big fan of the Southeast
[SPEAKER_04]: Asians, but the because of the aromas and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's been a lot of
hybridity between possibly like
[SPEAKER_04]: independent centers of domestication south
of Yunnan with the East Indian center of
[SPEAKER_04]: domestication.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a hunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I think these actual South
Asian land races like from Arissa and
[SPEAKER_04]: Andhra Pradesh and the Tarai regions of
Nepal are worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got already some like Dakshin
Kali is the name of the one from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got this kind of, you could say
like, being domesticated, it definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: has been domesticated for use as bud,
not just as hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the one is very much specifically
for bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of them, I think, will be really
interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice aromas from them too,
as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And types of effect are really good,
like very stimulating and positive.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds freaking awesome, to be honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm quite keen to see what the genomics
work discovers about them, because my
[SPEAKER_04]: hunch is that probably the East Indian
Nepal and East India are kind of where
[SPEAKER_04]: Sativa's really originate first.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait to see that all work out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where should people go to buy your seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the website?
[SPEAKER_04]: The realseedcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the for the modern stuff is
quickseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a stupid name, but it's like what I
originally planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd originally planned it as like a
budget thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to buy a bunch of cheapo
Dutch seeds and sell it on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want to get into big business
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of just at the speed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's for the time being
anyway, all the really interesting 90s
[SPEAKER_04]: material we've got and some other later
90s things like Cinderella 99,
[SPEAKER_04]: Amnesia, which are really good,
very strong as well if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: strong really strong stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some Colombian, like a Colombian
import that's probably like a Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: Lights crossed with a Colombian Landerace,
then crossed with some like airline
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian and Mexican things, all kinds of
things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a whole bunch of just like kind of fun
hybrids with things like Pakistan Tritrao
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush crossed with like some Landerace's,
which would be great like for just making
[SPEAKER_04]: hash and stuff and all for budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and very nice prices for most of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fun stuff to play with if you've got
the space and things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any way you'd prefer to be contacted to if
people want to reach out to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally, if you want a quick response
like the Gmail, realseedco.gmail.com
[SPEAKER_04]: request, but you can contact me on
Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes I'm not on there,
like I may not get back to you as quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I sometimes miss the incoming
messages, you know, like I forget to check
[SPEAKER_04]: the request bit sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, to use this use the site contact
form will just email me directly and I
[SPEAKER_04]: should get back to you within like two or
three days max, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I got to say, I'd love to have you
back sometime when the time allows.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I've really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very kind of you to give me the
space to just ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm slightly fucking burned out and a bit
like sleep deprived.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it seemed to be when I do these
podcasts, but maybe when I'm back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: UK, we can do another one that are more
civilized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's kind of a civilized hour now,
but I'm just not a civilized person.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've not been getting out of bed
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but yeah, so anyway, it's been
it's been good though.
