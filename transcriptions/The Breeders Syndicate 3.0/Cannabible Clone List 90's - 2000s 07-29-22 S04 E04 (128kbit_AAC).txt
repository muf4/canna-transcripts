[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-Dot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I can say it in a general
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went on a mission looking for
pockets of old things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you found some pockets of old
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of interesting, too,
because it's like one of the things about
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that I find really interesting,
and we'll talk about this as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone thing tonight, is that how brokers
and the demand from the public
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically changes what people grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in California or Oregon or Washington
are these places that are really sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: in tune or can't sort of came about with
medical or legal earlier, there was a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more rapid change in what people grew
because of what people demanded.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some cases now, you know,
you have to go and look for some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to call them backward states
because that's rude, but like states that
[SPEAKER_00]: were slower to adopt some of this stuff,
which meant that people could grow things
[SPEAKER_00]: that were a lot older and they still
worked really well for the crew that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because there wasn't a lot of
competition with the new new as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't there wasn't pressure to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, you know, that it kind of ties
into what we're talking about tonight,
[SPEAKER_00]: because pressure to change and a desire to
make your life easy and give the broker
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want is what kind of makes old
cuts disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, that is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're seeing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've talked about the last few
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you would have told me 10 years
ago that a real sour diesel could be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of hard to acquire, depending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually shocked that lately today,
people keep telling me that the forum cut
[SPEAKER_01]: of cookies is becoming hard to source,
which blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one of those things where,
you know, I've mentioned this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but every five or 10 years, weed reinvents
itself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Matt and I, Matt and I looked at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend up here who got a freezer
of somebody who I know everyone talks
[SPEAKER_00]: about freezer beans or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my friend got a freezer of old beans
from people that was someone that was
[SPEAKER_00]: retiring and kind of getting out of the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of being like from the ancient
80s or SSC or shit that people claim,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was almost all from 2008 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pretty cool era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to Matt because I was busy
having kids and doing a bunch of sit then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of like really your
prime time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were like really, really in tune
with what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was surprising to Matt and
I looking over it, just how ancient a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things were and how 99% of it was
unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even especially the rascal stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at the time was really hot,
selling really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of a FEM stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was our main competition at the time,
as it were for FEM stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at it, I'm not, a lot of that
stuff's hard to grab now and it's great
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only from, you know,
14, 12, 14 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which doesn't seem that long to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not actually that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, traumas are very current.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always feels current.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what, that's what's interesting
is like you get back to 10, 12 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's almost impossible to find a lot
of seed stock from then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go back 10 more years and
it's harder and you go back to the 90s and
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my God, and you go back to the 80s and
it's almost legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which isn't really all that
long, but the way prohibition works and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the market works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's people, there might
be people in various States that are slow
[SPEAKER_00]: to adapt that have been rocking the same
thing for 20, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's worked for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little customer base that they
have that they, you know, that they give
[SPEAKER_00]: their access to is super stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, so you almost need those pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, because like, you know,
when we talked about the purple episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: every big grower I knew ran some kind of
GDP, Urkel, Mendo P, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: great, something hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fast forward 10 years and like
six people held onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of hundreds, just in my little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and yeah, there's someone that's
talking right now about, Oh, I'm sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the purple craze was like,
I would say it was like Oh three,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh four, Oh five, maybe a little bit of Oh
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it went away for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went away for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 18 years or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now all of a sudden it's back and
people are just as annoyed now as they
[SPEAKER_00]: were back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, although back then I would
say one of the biggest things about the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple craze that I don't like,
uh, was it was really the first time where
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of diversity got lost because people
just wanted what the brokers wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were growing all these
different things and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and then all of a sudden people were
like, well, I want purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of beautiful, beautiful green,
lovely strains went by the wayside for
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the Urkel days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to, we're going to
talk about like old clones a lot today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really one of the eras that
that kind of ushered in like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody wants to grow the most popular
thing at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because pre purple craze of like,
you know, early two thousands,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of diversity that worked for
the small and the medium market was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was good weed, it probably sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike today, unlike today where you do
see a lot of really good weed go by the
[SPEAKER_01]: wayside for stuff that maybe we would all
agree isn't as, uh, what we would consider
[SPEAKER_01]: kind as somebody others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, somebody just said, Oh, six is when I
first went to reggae on the river and the
[SPEAKER_00]: custody kids had got purple, got purple
shirts on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to, I went to reggae on the river
from, I dunno, probably like 95 to Oh
[SPEAKER_00]: three or Oh four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Oh three was like their,
their 20 year anniversary maybe or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, after going for 10 years,
I'd seen most of the acts I wanted to see
[SPEAKER_00]: and it had gotten kind of a little hectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it kind of felt like it was more like
have a bunch of city kids show up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: river and hope nobody dies kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine reggae on the river in
Bakersfield, how that would go with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's no river.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a river here, but we didn't have,
we have the Kern river here, which is big,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, what we had was called reggae fest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, I started playing those
shows in about Oh six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we had the reggae band going on at
the time, but it was very different than
[SPEAKER_01]: like the steel drum type reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: That a lot of people had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just phenomenal to see what
Bakersfield offers in terms of reggae
[SPEAKER_01]: fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got to go to reggae on the river
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a tangent, but I will
talk about it just a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: because when I was coming out here in the
mid nineties as a Midwestern kid,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, reggae on the river has like two
extremely clear memories where I really
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that like the Emerald triangle in
California was a different place than
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was, there was dreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: City kids walking around reggae in 95,
96.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, back then it was still a two day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still a two day weekend festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot more locals that hadn't
had like as many like city kids and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up from the Bay yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people were walking around with,
with five gallon buckets with spears in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could buy a spear, like a,
a spear of weed, a top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, I thought you meant spears to
throw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, not like that kind of
spear, but I mean like for me is like
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who comes from like a world where
it all had to be hidden, walking up and
[SPEAKER_00]: down the lot with a bunch of stems
sticking out of a top and pulling out an
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inch top to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like where, where reggae used to be,
it's like, um, where the river is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can like look up and like the 101,
the highway 101 is way up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I was like sitting in a,
in a seat on the river bed and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling bongs and I looked up and there
was a highway patrol looking right at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so coming from the Midwest,
like if you make eye contact with a cop
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're doing drugs, like it's not a
good scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he waved to me and then just went back
to what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like literally ready to like
throw the bong in the river and run into
[SPEAKER_00]: the crowd because that was like my
training, like what I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you, it was time to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would just, he just gave me a wave
and went back to what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are, but those were like two
seminal moments of reggae on the river
[SPEAKER_00]: that for most people might not be that big
of a deal, but it just showed like what,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how different, how like there was a
bubble that we lived in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I went through and, and tonight
we're going to be not be joined by
[SPEAKER_01]: someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure we talked about it,
but as donors will do, we just decided
[SPEAKER_01]: that we'll see if he shows up,
you know, cause you know, plans are plans
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's, that's rough even for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see if this person shows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went through the can of Bible three,
cause I remembered that there is a great
[SPEAKER_01]: list in here of the late nineties,
early two thousands clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it would be fun to go
through this list together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's some that I added in,
there's some that I took out of their list
[SPEAKER_01]: because they really weren't that relevant
in terms of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just happened to be things that he
was aware of that he threw in the middle,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we got it all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brand even made it pretty with a fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, whenever you want to start going
through it, we can start going through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason, someone just asked Jason is not the
guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no one's talked to him, but you know,
who knows, you know, I used to be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good friends with him a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would definitely be a character to have
on one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard, you know, yeah,
it would be very interesting to have on
[SPEAKER_00]: super opinionated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, maybe he's mellowed in the last
bit, but you know, highly opinionated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super opinionated in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people that drove him absolutely
nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked him and I liked him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked like his vibe and what he was
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard because like when you're,
when you're so certain about something and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't leave room for other people's
opinions, you can secretly offend a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, which Matt knows nothing about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not, he's not, he's not into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, you know, they,
so just as a general sense, before we,
[SPEAKER_00]: before we, you know, dive into the list a
little bit, I will say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was mentioning earlier,
when there wasn't much weed, most weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was better than Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of like the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it was better than green or brown
Mexican, it's sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the thing matured and like,
and fads and waves started happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain popular cuts started getting,
you know, more demand than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was this period, I would say
from the mid nineties to the mid two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands that may have been the greatest
diversity era we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where most of these cuts that
Matt and I are going to talk about come
[SPEAKER_00]: from, because they came at a time when
there was a lot of seed banks starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of genetics starting
to get traded around friends and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all good weed had a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hadn't really, it hadn't really
been like, Oh, you, you don't have sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hadn't happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant a lot of people could grow
what they liked, pick what they liked and
[SPEAKER_00]: form a little vibe on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would honestly say that's probably
all that stuff that we're about to chat
[SPEAKER_00]: about is probably the backbone of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would also, put this in the
era before OG Kush was readily available
[SPEAKER_01]: in seed for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I noticed the big change in
whole collectives being just OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want OG, OG or fucking nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was the era right before
that was readily available for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I remember walking into a club
in, in, in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing literally no exaggeration,
like 25 different types of Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, well, like that's all
your, that's, that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, the reason why there's
financial reasons that happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there's, there was, you know,
there's various economic indicators that
[SPEAKER_00]: push all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when I first started coming
out to, uh, to Mendo, it was very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very common to buy mixed phenos pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the same strength.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were, they, they would blend the
different plants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have to be like, I have a 50
pack of just this one cut that had started
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, but then eventually it became,
it had to be this one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time that's happened,
even though the purples I love the Urkel
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Mendo P and stuff like that are
pretty close to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love soured easel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and most of the soured easels
that people argue about right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're real or not, or most of
them are good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG cushions are excellent smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm not as big a fan of cookies,
but, uh, you know, um, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they just came at a cost of
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big cost, a big cost of everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, I don't have the list in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you want to keep it in
some kind of entertaining format.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just start naming and then,
um, let me know if you have any memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just said the AOTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'm not familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: AOTA is AOTA and it was all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we used to rock the AOTA in the early
two thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the AOTA was really tasty lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever mentioned that, uh,
super cool that you popped that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I didn't even know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, uh, I don't think I've seen
the AOTA since probably, oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when the last time I saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the AOTA, but we had it in our crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember where it came from,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was, uh, it was, it was,
it was good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was fruity and, uh,
it was, it was really tasty.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I keep remembering little ones to add
in as I'm going through this, but I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: start at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afgui, which predictably was going to be
one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any experience with the Afgui?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, a lot of people liked the
Afgui.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of thought it was blandish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably smoked that nasty ass outdoor
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk about it then, cause I don't
have the greatest memories of the Afgui.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, it was spelled so many different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would spell it like Afgui,
Afgui.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think that gooey is Afgui,
uh, which goes from gooey breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have enough experience with gooey
breeder's gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the Afgui I was familiar with was a
more, I wouldn't say short, but yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was, it was more squattery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had this beautiful, almost watermelon
blueberry type turp that was very hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was true breeding for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, almost everything I crossed it to,
or that it was crossed in, took on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Afgui smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could see how people could get very
overwhelmed by it because it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: distinctive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could also describe it as like
cantaloupe berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was unique and I tended to love
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would pass on beautiful resin traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it had good potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the best yield, but, um, I think
overall, uh, it's one of my faves off this
[SPEAKER_01]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to diss it slightly cause I,
I just saw a bunch of, of low,
[SPEAKER_00]: of midsy before we called things mids,
uh, midsy outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would think it could be very midsy
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not, it was not, I never saw the
greatest examples, but then there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, how about, I have no
experience with real Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did get the Dago fake Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you, have you grown Albert Walker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I grew the real Albert,
Albert Walker, but I do think that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty flavorful and potent cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Fletch has a lot of familiarity
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fletch would be an excellent person to
chat about the history of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that like none of my,
none of my old crew, uh, or really had any
[SPEAKER_00]: access to it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think there was one friend of mine
that might've been growing it for a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't, it wasn't too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now this is one that a lot of people
are familiar with from, um, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck Dutch flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know there was two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am familiar with that, that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this guy, my God, does he go by
a crunch bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was a guy on the forums and you
could probably search for him or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the blue dot was one of the big
strains that used to get pushed through
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in Oakland a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pushed through one of the
early, uh, dispensaries that we called the
[SPEAKER_00]: third floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third floor, third floor, which was a
pretty famous dispensary back then in the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of people got their purple cuts
from the third floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very tied into my area to
Humboldt and, and, and Mundo and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a hold of like the granddaddy and
the Urkel and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, crunch bubble from IC mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to blow up tons of blue dot back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was a nice cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never ran it personally, but there,
it was like, it was one of those like Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: area specials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it really got rocked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think it was part of blow fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember that guy used to send it,
you know, you know, you have like 40
[SPEAKER_00]: lighters or whatever and yeah,
early warehouses with like, do you
[SPEAKER_00]: remember like all the old, like skinny
rectangle sunlight hoods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with like the, with the single
ended 600 watt Hortilux.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and like the trays and all that,
like that was like cutting edge at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, he had, he had some,
you know, pretty good size scenes or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that, and, and there was like a
huge demand for blue dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I don't have a bunch of personal
experience growing it, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get bags of it on occasion going
to the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it was definitely like,
it was a Bay area classic, I would say for
[SPEAKER_00]: a period of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, someone just said, I do think that
green crack is a phenol of skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, at least it's, it's heavily
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the mango, that loud mango turf,
I usually associate with skunk one type
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, blue motherfucking dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blue dream is one of those things that
has a bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, mostly because, uh, anything that
could get eight to 10 pounds, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, five, let's say five to 10
pounds, be a little bit more generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that could get five to 10 pounds
outdoor reliably, um, got blown up in my
[SPEAKER_00]: neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you, to me, if you grow blue
dream and like a little pot and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: like a four to eight or 10 ounce plant or
something, it's really flavy and really
pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people's opinion of blue dream is
this giant outdoor sort of B grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe poorly dried, um, you know,
rock hard buds, the turps aren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, it kind of got famous
because, um, you know, people used to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with blue dream billionaire, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where back when weed was worth a lot,
you could put out a 99 blue dreams and get
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sweet shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the, it's, it's, there's this
run with blue dream green crack,
[SPEAKER_00]: even my Maui a little bit where,
um, it's really big yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most people smoke the big
yielding stuff and don't smoke like the
[SPEAKER_00]: little more carefully grown nicer
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their memory of it is, uh, is just the
big blown out crazy nugs that are B grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing that I remember with blue
dream, during that era was that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people, when it first popped off,
we're growing one cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one blue dream cut that was
going around and it was pretty,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well, um, passed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people, a lot of people had this cut
was being blown out of collectives and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was pretty damn, I mean, good for the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very resinous, had good potency,
good yield, um, didn't mold up too easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the stuff that, you know,
would normally keep stuff down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that big, huge first push seed
lines were released named blue dream by
[SPEAKER_01]: emerald triangle seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think HSO put out a blue dream and those
quickly, quickly were picked up and run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those cuts were passed as blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the original cut was quickly drowned
out by, um, other blueberry haze type
[SPEAKER_00]: combos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I do think that that thing that
Matt just described is actually a common
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that can happen to certain strains
where a strain gets named something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then it gets ma- named and put into a
seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's all these phenos floating
around that aren't the original cut that
[SPEAKER_00]: made it famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so there was a bunch of
different blue dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposedly blueberry by some kind
of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was a super sil- the original cut
was super silver haze crossed a DJ short
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, you know, they, uh,
but, you know, like I said, if you grew,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you grew like a little six or seven
ounce plant of that, that thing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: light depth or your greenhouse or your
indoor, it was really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, our buddy pack works with it
currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did the blue dream train wreck hybrid
for all of us older heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like phenomenal and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was just going to say that,
you know, uh, the first time I really
[SPEAKER_00]: showed my face on any of these things was
when our buddy, uh, CSI asked me to do an
[SPEAKER_00]: event that he was throwing up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and I was on a panel with him
and, um, uh, you know, me and Jean and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, Kevin Joddry and just different
folks, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he talked about like, you know,
train wreck for Northern Humboldt was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the first named cuts, you know,
the wreck, the wreck, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of legends with the
wreck because it was, uh, it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was, I don't know if,
I don't know if Santa Cruz original haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a whole different movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, blue dream is super silver haze is a
much, much, uh, uh, change child of haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what select genetics to is
referring to is again, there were several
[SPEAKER_01]: different seed lines, uh, unknown
undisclosed haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people would agree that,
that blue hen from, um, what are they
[SPEAKER_01]: called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember off the top of my head,
but blue hen was the super silver haze 98
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry, probably where it was selected
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it was also widely grown other
than that under the name blue hen as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the very first Santa Cruz cut of blue
dream, which still exists is a super
[SPEAKER_01]: silver haze cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we're referring to
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody likes the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, and if you grow it too big,
it definitely is shitty, but I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sweet spot of yields and
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluegrass seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Cameron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluegrass seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's definitely a sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all the same sweet spot with
strains, but there's definitely a point of
[SPEAKER_00]: diminishing returns as you get bigger and
bigger plants where it just doesn't give
[SPEAKER_00]: you as nice of weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next would be bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I did, I had a lot of experience
with a lot of other bubble gums in the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed line, but this, this specific clone I
didn't get until a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This specific cup that CSI and PIP and all
those guys use came by a 1995 from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was bought the same year that
it won the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that's, that's what goes around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a serious, it's a selection from
serious seeds, bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bummer for me, it's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say I wouldn't say it's up
there with the best of the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's got, it's got a good little
punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the disappointing thing about it to me
is that it smells very strongly of bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: gum turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the flavor does not translate for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you don't get any, it doesn't,
it smells like you're smelling big league
[SPEAKER_00]: chew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't smell like you're chewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like you're chewing big
league chew when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most mold resistant things
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Arrowhead hemp farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indiana is serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a serious seed selection though.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people put the Indiana bubble gum
as the mother of serious seeds that they
[SPEAKER_01]: use, but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually a selection from their
seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want to go even back further,
there's, you know, Adam Dunn has this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing about where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, Neville felt like they just
stole it from working with him and renamed
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it was, it was some big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some combination of stuff that he
was already working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, um, so there's, there's
dispute over where, where, where it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens a lot where people try to
obscure origins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a common thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see bull rider in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to hear bull rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to break it to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bull rider was before my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was before my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I got to San Diego bull rider
was RIP fucking nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you could find was Afghani
bull rider, which there is no proof
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence anyway, the Afghani bull riders
related to the original bull rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, Betsy is said to be a sister to
the original bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have, uh, old Betsy still exists
and is still held and run by multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's supposed to be a sister of
the original bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know anyone that has original bull rider
that we believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that we're sure of, but old Betsy
exists and who knows it could exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of our, our experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely could exist, but I haven't
seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people made a lot of claims about
it recently, but none hold up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most are based on the Afghan bull
rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should say something just real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time when I was in Chicago,
uh, before I moved to California,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some bubble gum that they had bought
from out there and brought back and it had
[SPEAKER_00]: a hot pink hairs and was lime green,
um, and was super gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I never really saw it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only saw it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows who was growing it back then,
but I did see a very cool version of it a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time ago, uh, when Sirius first
released it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, that we went through bull
rider bubble gum, banana OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any, I know you've grown
banana OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any, uh, memorable experiences
with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do actually think that, you know,
a lot of these things, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: dessert and, uh, and fruit names now annoy
the fuck out of me because they have no
[SPEAKER_00]: relation what they're marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no relation to whatever they
named them after.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think banana OG does have a
little bit of banana turp to it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I will say that I will say it's,
it does have, I get a banana sense when I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's an odd OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what to make of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Oregon kid or somebody like that
made it famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really my background on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So banana OG came from a pack of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gears Kush, his original release of what
he wanted to be the OG kush seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, Chiquita bananas, not the
original.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came way later and as a rename.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so he got it as, uh, the OG Kush,
the, the clone that he had, and he got,
[SPEAKER_01]: he selected a male from some, uh,
I think it was an indoor, um, 60 40 from
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega matha, which meant 60 sativa 40
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He popped those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've asked, um, Tony from Sega matha.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said it was just something he
bought in bulk from someone he didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just labeled 60 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he knew exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, whatever was in the 60 40
kicked, whatever would be true for these
[SPEAKER_01]: banana turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he released OG years, Kush expecting it
to be a good version of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where people found this
beautiful clone that was very banana like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and later on, you know, as people pop more
seeds, more people found different clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would call banana OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a one that circulates right now
that most people have is the same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few more that are more laughy
taffy, like artificial banana type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've smelled one banana hybrid from,
um, uh, Pico our buddy, and it smelled
[SPEAKER_01]: like fucking banana bread, like just dead
on like that banana cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the most amazing banana
smelling things that I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, I'll throw in something that's,
uh, kind of related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, before, uh, there used to be
in the, in the forties, fifties and
[SPEAKER_00]: sixties, um, the banana that everyone ate
was a different banana, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that you eat, then you eat now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was destroyed by root fungus,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a much different flavor than the
current banana that everybody is grown up
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is kind of how
banana candy tastes a little different
[SPEAKER_00]: than you would expect it to taste like
it's banana, but it like, it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can think of it as like candy,
chemi banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that flavor was, was developed off the
first bananas that were commercially sold
[SPEAKER_00]: in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cavendish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most banana candy is based on the
flavor of the Cavendish banana,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the modern banana that everybody is
used to eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I actually owe a great deal
of my career to the banana OG and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon kids stuff and, uh, Tony from
sacred math is stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still lives on today and a lot of
strains that I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the others work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So banana OG is the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I like it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say in a lot of out-crosses,
depending on what you cross it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are phenos that are just straight
cardboard and they're hard to dodge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that clone stands a test of time,
I think for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of got buried a little bit and it
got lost amongst other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, it's a, it's a cool,
unique turf and it had a nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, here's a fun one that,
that, um, probably is, is actually several
[SPEAKER_01]: different, different clones or seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the Cavendish replaced the,
I was off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking about which banana
cultivars existed and I got it reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Cavendish was the first and the,
uh, the Cavendish is now and it replaced
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to pronounce it,
but it was like Gross McHale or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, someone keeps asking about
the Chiquita.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, the Chiquita Banana was,
uh, popped from the Platinum Banana OG
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush, which was a hybrid of Bubba Kush,
something in Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came, I mean, that was so much
later because it was from my work and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was later like seven years after I made
the Platinum Banana OG and my work was so
[SPEAKER_01]: much later after Oregon Kid did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's, they're very different,
but, um, the Chiquita Banana is based on
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but it has a lot more in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, many, many different clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw several in San Diego called
cat piss that were very different from
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, I didn't smell any cat piss and some
people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, I'll say a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one is that, you know, I think that
it's one of those aspects of smell that
[SPEAKER_00]: people relate stuff to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's like, I think it's like,
I think it's like how some people perceive
[SPEAKER_00]: certain kinds of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and since turpentine is kind of a
common aroma that pops up, I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: more than one cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I do believe we're going to have a
Shahbud on the, on the program here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could probably save the deep
dive into cat piss for him because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of his specialties and he knows an
enormous amount about the history and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: tried all the different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a San Diego cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Pittsburgh cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but, uh, you know,
so there was, there was a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bringing in someone if he wants to see
how he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is cheetah piss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who fucking knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than having the name piss in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, that's marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a cookie team coming up with
marketing names, cookie, never really has
[SPEAKER_00]: any names that tie to what this strain is
actually like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they definitely have a team of
marketing people deciding what to call
[SPEAKER_00]: things and what kind of art goes with it
and what the packaging is going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like and what the milars are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they're a very new school type of
approach to naming strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene, you can text if you have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, someone asked if any SSH smells like
cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a great example of
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that pissy smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have argued.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go and read like a bunch of
Neville's, uh, old posts on hazes,
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll talk about when you inbreed haze,
all you get is a bunch of cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we inbreed haze, all we get is a
bunch of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as any breeder will tell you,
once turpentine becomes the dominant smell
[SPEAKER_00]: in your strain, boy, is it hard to get
other smells to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is very, very, very dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's different turpentines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are astringent, you know,
some are this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a range in turpentine
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but yeah, I, whenever,
whenever Neville talks about cat piss,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of, of turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know there's Afghanis that are
acrid and ammonia type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I used to think of when
people would say pissy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think of the acrid ammonia urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people think of
turpentine and I just, my nose does not
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up that piss scent from turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you, you know, the other
part of it is like, once you, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or you smoke C five or something like
that, and it's just a turpentine monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he refers to it as very cat pissy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then obviously that's what his mind goes
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, next the cheese, the cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cheese has a pretty cool story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the oldest skunk one Fino
that's spread around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be from the late
eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, it's supposed to be popped by
sort of like a bunch of, would you call
[SPEAKER_00]: them punk anarchist squatters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposed to be, I don't know much about
the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were supposed to be ravers
or some electronic thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, when anarchists,
you know, like punks, ravers, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: underground weirdos listening to unpopular
music, uh, you know, yeah, type of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but skunk, but it was a Fino of skunk one
and most skunk one, uh, is citrus or
[SPEAKER_00]: floral, uh, sometimes grape, uh,
never skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rarest would be probably the kind
of a funky cheese aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a system after of it
supposedly calls psychosis, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly a circulated, uh, you know,
the English are all big on it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the few things that actually
originated from their Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the blues livers psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another one too, that they
always used to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd really, I'd love to grow them one
day, but I had never been, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I could get it from, uh,
from a source with provenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only gotten it from like seed lines
or, you know, it's one of those cuts that
[SPEAKER_00]: different people give different names to,
like the bright side cut or the this cut
[SPEAKER_00]: or the that cut, you know, that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically, it's basically a
classic skunk one.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, the other thing I will say
about is I learned a lot from that cut a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge amount from that fucking cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned that it was one of those cuts
that like early on growing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was really foot funky cheese for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I got it later and it was fruity and
sweet, I was like, no way, this is a,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a fucking failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not what I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of those cuts that really
taught me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are talking to suicide cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like any, like a lot of old famous
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I'll, I'll use a different
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my lifetime, I've watched the
chem dog get called chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shortened it to dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy came online and it became the
skunked VA cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got called the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, different cuts that are the
same, the same cut can get different
[SPEAKER_00]: nicknames and different, different things
over time with different crews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Exodus, suicide, bright side,
you know, all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're all, you know, there's like,
there was like a small little family that
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of this late eighties English
scene, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and you know, it's, it's,
it's skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breeds really well for calyx,
you know, kale, you know, better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It improves leafiness, makes less
leafiness, makes long running colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mildly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's a most cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most skunks are in like the mid teens in
terms of, in terms of THC, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: gets big little metallic, maybe,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, someone mentioned one that we
actually, I should have put on the list,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, did you ever have any experience
with blackberry up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not blackberry Kush, but just blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we had more with blackberry Kush,
although I always thought it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry and people added Kush to it
because at the time all these brokers
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, here's your purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the original blackberry was a lot
different from the, the blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blackberry Kush was a white rhino
Bubba hybrid from Oregon kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the original blackberry was from,
um, a dude named Soma Blaise, if I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember correctly, Scott Soma Blaise,
and he ended up passing away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Naboo ended up kind of carrying on the
torch of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there were a lot of
beautiful pictures, I think in one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these can of Bibles, if I can pull it up
super fast, has a beautiful picture of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a real famous picture of it
inside of a jar of, um, like blackberry
[SPEAKER_01]: preserves, uh, that was really famous of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at the time there wasn't a lot of
colored weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stood out very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it was, it was used a lot in a
lot of the hybrids that were famous from
[SPEAKER_01]: that point on, um, because it bred true
for whatever its purple traits were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for a long time, it, you know,
people thought it was different from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo perps, but I think later on people
realized that there was a good chance it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a, a bag seed from Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's kind of where we're at
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Naboo had a voodoo doll right now,
you'd be getting stabbed in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be really upset, but it does seem
like the timeline, uh, is, is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the one thing I'll say about the
blackberry, whether it was blackberry or
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry push, um, both of them were
pretty weak potency wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell of a midsy fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say midsy, but not potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I, yeah, it was very hard to get high
from that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if that was, if that was the
only thing in your jar, you better have a
[SPEAKER_00]: light potency, a light tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, if you want to get anywhere
on it for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, blackberry push, especially I
had a very hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful too, cause it was super
resinous and it was one of those things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I always put in my head as like,
that was some beautiful looking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you pick it up, you see all that
resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the, it was the, it was the shit
that taught me pretty fucking frosty weed
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, uh, blackberry push was the kind
of thing that brokers would come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would come up here and freak out on
and buy a shit ton of once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they wouldn't, they wouldn't move
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, no, I got way too many
complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too like, people want to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people are comparing it to purple
punch, but, um, purple punch has,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think personally great turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say blackberry push really was
not on the great turp range.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't even call, there was no
turps then that was even, that was even
[SPEAKER_00]: before most of the revolution of the
sheesh that happened again with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nails and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it never got the, it never really got
the, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was bumped in Mendo for a time,
but yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your, your, your favorite Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we started covering some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it was, uh, it's one of
those things where it's been talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: tons by various people, myself,
uh, our buddy skunk VA and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say that the best thing you
could say about Kim dog is that it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got rare potency, uh, very rare
potency and the potency tends to be
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant and translate into lots of
hybrids that you make with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes up for being, and strangely,
it doesn't look very resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of looks to me like ancient,
um, it's, you know, it's like some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient ugly Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's hideous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in like, I see the skunk VA crazy
composer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two can make that shit look so
pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't know how they do it,
but most grows like even my grows of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it is just cannibalizing its own
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that, that actually sour does the
same thing as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of why I think,
but they, um, there's an aspect to that
[SPEAKER_00]: where a lot of, I'll say this,
and this might piss some people off or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, but, uh, there's a lot of people
that are taking, we would always,
[SPEAKER_00]: always take the, the, the dog to like say
10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we kind of somewhere
between 65 and 72 or 73 days, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how long you could let it rock,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it would test somewhere
between, you know, 18 and 22 or 23% then,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it knocked your head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when all this testing bullshit
came into effect, they realized that that
[SPEAKER_00]: was too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some people started cutting it at
like 53, 54 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see white hairs all over it,
but it'll test at 29%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so the grower gets to grow it
quicker and turn it quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the dispensary is happy because
it gets to put this high THC label on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people end up on the legal
market these days, buying premature chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what it does to my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice if it had flavor too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this is what I'll say sometimes,
and this is just my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes chem dog has amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really deep flavor that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can smell it in the weed and it can,
and that smell translates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I grow chem dog all the time and
maybe one or two rips a year, it gives me
[SPEAKER_00]: that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have tried a million different ways
to figure out whether it's heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's new, whether it's this,
whether it's that I've grown it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it every which way you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it gives me the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the potency is almost always
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency and the high is pretty
standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest I've seen of that Terp Extreme
was from, and I always talk about this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like I didn't get the love for Chem 91
or the dog, as you guys called it,
[SPEAKER_01]: until I smoked a Chem 91 hybrid that he
had made that was very Chem 91 dominant in
[SPEAKER_01]: the turf, but it was just turned to a 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine it's probably how Chem 91 was
when you guys first started growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understood the love for it after
that because that turf profile is fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: nice and it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smelled anything close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hard to coax out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does do this thing where you can
grow it perfectly organic or chem,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the times it'll get this leaf
rust and it'll start cannibalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's leaves and it'll start dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start looking like shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud itself usually stays perfectly
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of those endless white pistols
on it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like no matter what people do,
it just will keep throwing white stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll throw out something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you used to grow it under Hortalux or
your standard whatever, it would take 80,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would take 70, like I said,
68, 72 days, something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a bunch of my favorite head stash
under pure ceramic metal halides,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a blend of the 31 and the 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dog shit got done two weeks
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled the Chem 91 at 87 days and it
still had white hairs all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did this weird thing where the
Spectrum made the Sativa finish two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then made the dog go two and a half
weeks longer than I've ever seen it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: still wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who the fuck knows why that is?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I've been growing it since
1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually have one or two at least
going for head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've grown it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, your second favorite maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D has a different high than Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's prettier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frostier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much prettier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells, people call it, I don't know
what you call it, roadkill or dead bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: or some kind of decrepit funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always refer to it as bad breath to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's weird about it is that I can
crack a jar six feet away from someone and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be like, who's got the skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also smelled baby shit come out of
it, like pure putrid baby shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a lot of expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you get close to it and you can't
smell that skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just smell the putrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a hybrid, honestly,
of this might get me in trouble,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's a hybrid of Chem 91 and
Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Super Skunk gives it its
frost and its color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It even herms kind of like the Super Skunk
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, the Chem 91 throws that
crazy potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a short squat Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also say that there's three or
four fakes that float around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those fakes tended to get trade baited
a lot more than the original cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt was talking about how certain cuts
got buried by the wave of what came after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots and lots of people have fake Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wanted D, but not everybody had
access to D.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was always a bunch of people
willing to pass around fake versions of it
[SPEAKER_01]: for a little bit of jinga, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this thing, too, where it's
like when I say trade baiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: what Matt and I mean when we talk about
trade baiting is some people would go
[SPEAKER_00]: after cuts just to get certain things to
be able to trade them for other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there was people like myself or
Skunk VA or others that held on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D and had them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different people that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they held it kind of tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were some people that got
it just so they could use that cut to
[SPEAKER_00]: unlock a bunch of other cuts they wanted
to get access to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just so happened that they got some
fakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like some pretty reputable
people, that like are supposed to know a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch, got fakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be really hard to tell in the
bag what, you know, they look very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side by side grows usually show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, the real D, like it has a
potency and a flavor the other ones don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone just said, I have no idea if the
GMO was made with the real Chem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, GMO was made in Spain,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very doubtful that it was used in
real Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO is a great cut on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of irrelevant in the
sense that it works good, it yields good,
[SPEAKER_00]: it smokes good, it washes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a good cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always like when I categorize it in
my head, I always refer to like the Chem
[SPEAKER_01]: D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember it as the more cushy looking
one by its nature, how it stacks and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Chem 2, I always remember as the
most cushy of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more like little tiny nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm being real, I think there's Chem 91
in both Sour Diesel and in Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chem D is sort of like a squat Afghan
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sours are sort of like a tall lanky
Colombian skunk type version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my view.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem Dog number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem Dog number four is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the most widely circulated
Chem, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see a lot of fake cuts ever pop
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really fake cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reminds me a lot of NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Pip, who we joke, loves to take
everything 12 weeks, no matter how long
[SPEAKER_00]: it's supposed to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had him take a really nice nug of Chem 4
and put it on top of a picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's 1989 NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really is a dead ringer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I smoke enough Chem D or Chem 4,
I get like a raciness in my chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has long running buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I'll say about it is that
it takes probably 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people cut it at 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people were cutting it at
8 to 9, like in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of Chem D that doesn't
make the cut, because most people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to take it that full 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue dream of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take the Chem 4 84 days or
something like that and you grow it nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say no, Chem 4 is probably one
of the furthest from the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks nothing like the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Chem 1 is probably the furthest
from the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Chem 4 definitely is very far from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to do the Chem Sys or S1
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do... We can do the Chem Sys real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem Sys is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists in a couple of S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is called the Bundy Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them got traded as Chem D all over
the place, mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy that I always call Staten Island
confirmed that Greg had both the Sys and
[SPEAKER_00]: the dog in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he chose not to bring the Sys West
because he didn't like the high and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good history on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry Slider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any experience with Cherry
Slider?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no history on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from a dude named Skitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from the early boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked, what is the Chem Sys
Skunk the A uses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he uses the Bundy Cut,
which is a Chem Sys S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Greg about the Chem Sys
because since it never came West with my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, I never really had a bunch of
access to it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me as far as he knew the
original was dead and there was only some
[SPEAKER_00]: bag seeds that existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be that as it may.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever fuck with Chocolate Trip?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a Dutch Flowers Cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I grew is the one a lot of people
grew and I thought it was like a C99
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, but no one's ever said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've never talked to anybody about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'm just fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say about Dutch Flowers is
that I've always, I've always,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said a bunch on this show that I
thought that weed wasn't ready for modern
[SPEAKER_00]: day marketing techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're a bunch of like half
autistic weirdos that hide out with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, Dutch Flowers in the forums,
some days they wrote beautiful ad copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the best, the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you would read their Metal Haze or
their Chocolate Trip or their this or that
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd read it and they would get
people so hyped for their drop,
[SPEAKER_00]: just paragraph upon paragraph of gorgeous
writing about what the weed was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would get so fucking excited
about every single Dutch Flowers drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, yeah, they, they,
they did well with let's get a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional ad guy in here and evoke some
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use language very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sure did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I collected their stuff heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even after I found out like by growing
a bunch of it, that it was really,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was either just stuff renamed or just
not very interesting, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking questions real quick
that are going way too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm apologize if your question doesn't
get picked up because we're trying to chat
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say someone just mentioned Pada
Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pada Gold was a Pada Gold and was one of
my favorite, probably my favorite thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that came from The Flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a Hindu Kush by Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very, very flavorful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had this other thing called the
Real McCoy, which was a Hawaiian by Skunk
One.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be on the list, but there's a,
it was a Hawaiian by Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was also super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked both of those a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final good question I thought
was Gravity from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think, although we're not sure,
it seems like Gravity is unreleased
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Black Domina was a Sensi release.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Hash Plant by NL1 by Garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had a few different versions that
he made before he released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Gravity is one of the two
unreleased versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal Haze is one of the Dutch Flowers
ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was basically a Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was definitely one of the ones that
they got people drooling over releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a bunch of that one as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are going in motherfucking
alphabetical order.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You goddamn pendejos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotton Candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton Candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever grow a Cotton Candy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did grow a Cotton Candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually recently grew a Cotton
Candy S1 through my buddy who lives near
[SPEAKER_00]: me that I've traded back and forth with
for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about the lineage or
the backstory of it, but I did like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Federation Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotton Candy was the one that I was
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like most stuff from Federation,
there's a lot of accusations of renaming
[SPEAKER_01]: what not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure what it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've always been a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked Cotton Candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it will make a comeback one
day just because of its name and its
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a good modern look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just threw in Sensei Star
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke from Paradise Seeds is Sensei Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei Star is an amazing line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He refuses to talk any lineage or history
that I'm aware of about specifics of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, myself, our buddy Pip, others have
been hunting forever for real information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried recently with Luke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I highly respect Luke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's one of the most respected actual
breeders over in Amsterdam by other seed
[SPEAKER_01]: makers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a very serious breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it came from a different era where a
lot of people stole his genetics that he
[SPEAKER_01]: would give out test testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would release it before he even
released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say a lot of the people like Simon
from Serious Seeds, Luke, others,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't see any benefit in giving out
lineage that their competitors would just
[SPEAKER_00]: steal and claim to have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville was extremely open about what
he used and where he got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every other Dutch person after that
was tight lipped as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's probably accurate,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's super accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got they got very tight lipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw no benefit to revealing what it
was made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all their secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want anybody stealing the
genetics and they didn't even want anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: writing similar genetics on their own
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just kept quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't we don't know what Sensei Star
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what AK is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what Cali Mist is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cough is something that we have a really
good friend of ours on the Discord that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more suited to talk cough history
than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cough is very likely an NL5 haze
phenyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of Connecticut in the early
90s and it made its way to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people refer to it as the Fort
Collins cough, but it did start on the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's an NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the buzz like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's one of those, you know,
it's one of the surviving NL5 haze phenyls
[SPEAKER_00]: in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was cough one and cough two,
which were hybrids of that, which have
[SPEAKER_00]: their own sort of story behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll have him on one day to
promote.
[SPEAKER_00]: He breeds and does cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a good friend of ours and he
knows a lot of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just did an interview with Dude Grow
shows working man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where he gives the whole history that he
knows of the cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people want to watch it, it was just
recently uploaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a trustworthy character and he's
had it for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he knows most of the people
involved that brought it to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say I've said this before,
too, but NL5 haze probably has the most
[SPEAKER_00]: surviving cuts around of any 90s cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That between Europe and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yields huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes 12, 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabney Blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Dabney Blue ever run up in your area?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was big in San Diego and it was
big in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's something I know,
like my my knowledge might even be
[SPEAKER_00]: negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it was an awesome cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a blueberry muffin type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more potent than most of the
blueberries that were around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's about all there is on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's asking about Big Sur Holy Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I guess we didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't cover Big Sur Holy Weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do Big Sur Holy Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Sur Holy Weed has a lot of there's a
lot of legends behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was supposedly grown by monks in
central California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that my my buddy who gave me
both the Super Skunk and the Chem,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was his favorite weed that he could get
on Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And supposedly there was Big Sur Holy
Skunk and Big Sur Holy Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both were sold on Dead Tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he swears that Big Sur Holy had such a
unique smell that you could have somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: walk by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the fanny pack era.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could have somebody walk by
and not only could you tell that they had
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed, you could tell that they had
the Big Sur Holy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a there's some guys,
obviously, that brought some seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff that have some legend to it
that brought it to maybe Adam Dunn or
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had supposedly they mixed it into
sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, you know, it's well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't make sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you wouldn't have been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can never pronounce this, but it
supposedly descended maybe from purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is the Hatsuneho purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also refer to it as Zacatecas
purple because Zacatecas is a Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And easier to pronounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was the Z Hatsuneho purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hooked on phonics truck never
stopped by my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just let Matt take that one because I
was going to mangle it bad if I tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a bunch of rumors about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a legendary strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my oldest friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his favorite weed on Dead Tour and
it was sold on Dead Tour two different
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's been proven about it,
what it has been proven about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that that's supposedly one of the
key ingredients in Sensei Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from a direct quote from Adam
Dunn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But take it for what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's the people are asking a
bunch of questions and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to go through this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's there's good
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get to them all,
which I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're trying to do this in
alphabetical order or some kind of order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys are asking for shit down in
the asses, it'll be a while because this
[SPEAKER_01]: is looking like it'll be a few parter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The W's so you're fucked right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm determined to keep this in some kind
of fucking order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day Wrecker Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that one has a lot of legend to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think because it has a lot of legend
and not a lot of like information,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of claims made about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people refer to the Day Wrecker
as the first real headband.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the original crew that had the
first headband never called it that at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, it's you know,
Diesel is one of the most famous American
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of nicknames that get
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never ran anything that I thought was
Day Wrecker Diesel that had any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of verifiable story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: A deep dive and it's actually on the
Breeders Syndicate YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's up there and you can watch
it up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently made it available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a deep dive on trying to do a
research provenance based on internet
[SPEAKER_01]: research on the Day Wrecker Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got not very far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't go back very far, but the
clones been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to find things other
than like some, some tour manager from a
[SPEAKER_01]: great full bed kind of gave it out to some
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's likely where that, where it
begins.
[SPEAKER_01]: The story, but it does appear to be some
kind of Chem 91 hybrid to me, like Chem 91
[SPEAKER_01]: early OG type hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ripping potent and breeds for that
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the cut, but I just don't know if
it's the original diesel like it claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next one?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got dog shit electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dog shit electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it came out of Minneapolis area,
Minnesota in the very early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be a NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that's a hundred percent
guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's conjecture a little bit, but boy,
does it really, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made its way to Oregon and got renamed
dog shit, which is a shame because it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think electric Boogaloo is one of the
coolest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, you know, it's a 12 or 13 week
Sativa very up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of looks like to me,
like classic nineties, Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of smells like classic nineties
weed to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, it's, it's one of the pretty,
if it is pure NL five Hayes, it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the prettier ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like visually attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend the hybrids that come
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it or get hybrids of it,
I enjoy it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one that's totally,
I have no experience with at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you might dumpster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dumpster is supposedly the story of a dog
shit electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give dumpster is that a guy got busted,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops in the nineties were throwing
all of his equipment and his weed out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they were upstairs fucking with
it, some people walked by and saw weed
[SPEAKER_00]: plants sticking out of the dumpster and
grabbed one and ran off with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they named it dumpster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it might be real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not that story is true or
whether it's a tale or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't give you a lot of information
about its lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, G 13 we did just a few
weeks ago with archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just uploaded it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went into more detail on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can skip over that one for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden fucking goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you talk about the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was made by Jeff, Mr. Dank from
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm correct, there was a sister cut,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember its name, the funky bitch
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a ISS Romulan, Island Sweet
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Island Sweet Skunk was a rename of
something else from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Island Sweet Skunk is supposedly an NL5
haspheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know multiple Canadians that have told
me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And supposedly it got renamed by Mark
Emery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wanted skunk seeds to sell in his
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is supposedly an NL5 haspheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was crossed to something
from the one that got sold from Mark Emery
[SPEAKER_00]: was crossed to something that Breeder
Steve had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not popping up in my head right on
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're right, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Dank was from Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I said Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got real popular in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think maybe he moved there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it got super popular in Colorado for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Island Sweet Skunk, hybrid of
Steve's Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why he flipped out about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet Skunk Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet Skunk Widow, ISS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what Steve says it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Federation supposedly changed the
name in his story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was I thought Golden Goat was
very frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a nice like narrow leaf dominant
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was it was one of those ones
that got overblown in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people just kind of shit
talked it after a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I thought it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Granddaddy Purple came about in the
purple craze era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the probably the first
two purple cuts that got famous right then
[SPEAKER_00]: was my Mendo Perps and the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right around that same time,
Lavender came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a debate between whether or not
Lavender was massively different than
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel or was just a different little Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy that I was just talking about
that lives over in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember 20, 22 years ago, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had brought down the Lavender from
Myers flat area of Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like looked at it and it was like
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like almost as close to the same
weight as you could imagine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granddaddy Purple was supposedly that
Urkel by by Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have people have tried to push it
on that this gentleman that disappeared
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly a long time ago from Salmon Creek
that maybe it was crossed to the Salmon
[SPEAKER_00]: Creek Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that worked for him and stuff like
that said that they don't believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: because they never saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and why wouldn't they have it if
it came from that Chris guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Chris, Chris Gacke.
[SPEAKER_00]: He disappeared in 03 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was murdered, but they've never found
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an open case still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so there's there's
different versions of of the origin story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that the origin of Granddaddy
Purple, the origin of Urkel are all very
[SPEAKER_00]: mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's lots of people that have
tossed their hat into the ring and said
[SPEAKER_00]: various things about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that, you know,
it's one of it's for how popular it
[SPEAKER_00]: became.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one of the ones that you
really can't tie back to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some GDP stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I tend to believe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell it, you know, and people
make their decision on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this woman that I'm friends with
her family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty rare to have a pretty woman
growing up in Leightonville and Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of like furry, weird hippie men
that do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so someone in their 20s and 30s
growing supposedly there was this old
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam vet that brought back some some
seeds from Vietnam and grew a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas and started mixing them with local
Afghans and sort of had his own,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was really common at the time,
his own his own hill wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was retiring because he'd done
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave he gave her a few hundred
seeds of his hill wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said that she found what got
called the GDP in the first 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, she partnered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped her build it, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: She partnered on a 66 lighter with Ken
Estes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say his full name because he's he's
well known.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gave the cut to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a super anarchist, had no interest in
being public or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ken took it down to the bay and added his
name to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the first people I know of
that added his name to a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, later on, other people started
doing that, taking cuts that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: theirs and throwing their name on it as
part of claiming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's given some mangled versions of
that story I just told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he didn't actually have any part
to do with the origin story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it from my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interview that I post all the time
of Ken telling his origin stories at
[SPEAKER_01]: first, he says it was a a skunk from a
Vietnam vet that quickly turns into a
[SPEAKER_01]: Native American gifted it to him in front
of a some headlights because he was such a
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful white man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he turned it into a seed line that he
helpfully called Ken's GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but my version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew them at the time was that she
gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, and this is back in
the early 2000s or whatever, when everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to stay invisible, especially if
you were running 60, 70 lights and off a
[SPEAKER_00]: generator in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided to go down and flow it into
the bay and flow it into the third floor
[SPEAKER_00]: and flow it into various dispensaries and
made a name for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can choose what you want to believe
about all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's here's another one that ties
straight into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How Cushman's is it was he the inventor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Brett Bogue from Apothecary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was he the inventor of the great?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is who is the creator of great?
[SPEAKER_00]: This might also get me in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just let people decide.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As everyone is well aware, you know,
when things become famous, quickly one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two famous cuts start getting renamed or
hybrids or bag seeds start getting named
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's this there's this,
you know, big push to have your own shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with Cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened with the purple craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at first there was just Mendo Perps and
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden there was Mendo
Perps, Urkel, Grape Ape, GDP, Platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple, Purple Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: On and on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people think that Grape Ape came
out of Willets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think that Grape Ape was just
a rename.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a gentleman you can find him
on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Dallas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he partnered with Shiloh and he claims
that he flew it down from Canada in cigar
[SPEAKER_00]: cases and brought the Grape Ape to Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he claims that Kyle Cushman had nothing
to do with it other than Kyle Cushman
[SPEAKER_00]: moved to Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, five or six or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came friends with dude and got it
from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Kyle had absolutely nothing to do with
it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to give anybody credit,
it's either renamed GDP or Urkel,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag seat of such or Homie actually did
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with a lot of these outlaw
stories and stuff, it's kind of who you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there was also the story that
it was Urkel Shiva Skunk as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what went around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, both referred to it as Urkel's
pretty sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: It showed up after the purple craze was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll explain the purple craze for
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I mean the purple craze, I mean that
there was brokers coming up from the Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: to Mendo and saying, we will buy every
gram of this purple weed that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 50 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 80 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 150 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 250 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cash you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens to growers when they
start hearing brokers want to cash you out
[SPEAKER_00]: on however much you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your neighbor is like, dude,
I'm having some trouble moving my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going as fast as I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the neighbor's like, well,
I'll give you this cut and you just give
[SPEAKER_00]: it all to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll move everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you got of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then after a craze
happens like that, all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: names pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it went from one or two
purple strains to eight or 10 of them
[SPEAKER_00]: within a year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably would have lasted longer,
but sort of the Kush, the Kush craze and
[SPEAKER_00]: the sour diesel thing happened and sort of
pushed the purples to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green crack also known as green Kush with
a C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I, I don't have a verifiable
story behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know people claim various
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know more about it than I do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to speak on it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some kind of skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it's pure skunk or
anything like that, but boy, it grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of, I think a lot of like a DNA's
lemon skunk and all that shit is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: prettier name for green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called green Kush when it entered
our circle and I got it through the hogs
[SPEAKER_01]: family circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was originally, whenever it was on
the tags, it was always CUSH Kush and no
[SPEAKER_01]: Cecil did not make green crack or have
anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How Cecil's name entered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me and Cecil went over this
specifically because I was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first people to bring green crack into
seed form to the community and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to hunt down the history on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had heard the same thing with Cecil.
[SPEAKER_01]: His crew had a seed line called Kush,
C-U-S-H.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's as far as the connection went.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that they both had renamed Kush's
and they were both spelled C, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as the connection went.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably a skunk one type
because it's super mango with a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would turn mega, mega, purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also bred true for that purple trait
and it would show up genetically as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to just with cold and it's
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I want to see it come back,
but it's one of those clones that was
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere and now is nowhere all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say the same thing about,
I said about blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a four to six or seven ounce
plant of green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a five or eight pound plant in
the outdoor and beat the fuck out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't dry it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a little moderate size plant of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got really nice lemony turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a unique kind of aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a nice uplifting buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think DNA's lemon skunk is just a
renamed green crack that they prettied up
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were known for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they started their company,
no offense to them or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just went around Mendo and Humboldt
and various places and gathered up as many
[SPEAKER_00]: good clone-onlys as they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they started their company as Soma's
little buddies and he gave them a C99 that
[SPEAKER_01]: they renamed to some sort of haze,
cantaloupe haze, I believe they called it
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started their company off of C99 and
renamed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start your company that way,
there's no reason to start doing it the
[SPEAKER_01]: right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed business has never been
particularly honorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Hogg's Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from our crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our San Diego crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was made by Jimbo, James Hogg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said several different things that it
possibly could have been made.
[SPEAKER_01]: His big one was a Williams-Wonder hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, personally, it was probably a
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some type of Afghani Williams-Wonder would
fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrong lights would fit of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be foot funky cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a lot of the similar thiolic smells
of a Chem D or a cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen sweet Hogg's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has very specific type growth traits on
top, kind of foxtail-y a little bit on
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't allowed out of our circle for a
long time and once it was, it was out in
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are working with
it now and the real one's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though James is gone, his family
still runs the clothing company and grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and still pushes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still out there and cool to be had.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's yours, Headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headband used to be very mysterious and
because it was very mysterious in origin,
[SPEAKER_00]: it supposedly came out of New York and
there wasn't a lot of information about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which allowed a lot of different
people to be like, this cut is the real
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, I have an LA cut that I got
as headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a headband that Loompa attached
his name to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a headband that I call the 56 Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the one that I use a lot,
if people are wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of headbands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of them are good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, it's come out and some of the
old Sour Crew has come out and said that
[SPEAKER_00]: they had these cuts, Diesel 1 and Diesel
2, which were bag seed of some chem they
[SPEAKER_00]: were getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew them out and there was a buddy
of theirs in New York that thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: the Diesel 2 made it feel like there was a
band around his head after he smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They nicknamed it the Headband and it so
happens that that cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds coming out of that cut is where
the first Sour Diesel came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then 707 headband, the headband that I
have that I call the LA, 707 is a child of
[SPEAKER_00]: that made by Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed that to something that I'm not
sure of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that have tried to say that
the one that Matt used is what I call the
[SPEAKER_00]: 56 is the original New York City headband
and people advertise it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his crew were big on saying it was
the first headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa was big on saying that his headband
was the only real headband and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else was a pale imitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the Sour people come out and start
talking about it and it turns out that the
[SPEAKER_00]: headband they're speaking of that was the
first one was not Kush-like at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones that there was a
lot of stories based on it because there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a bunch of mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a thing about that 56 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the 56 day just because it's the
least offensive nickname of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came out of the Kush crew in Southern
California and it came up to the Bay and
[SPEAKER_00]: they renamed it intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa's story is a bit shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it and he decided to add his name
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since he's been extremely touchy
about that headband has to be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: headband and everybody else is just a
bitch for trying to have as good of a
[SPEAKER_00]: headband as Loompa headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a muddled history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time we talk about it, it stirs up
so much shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have no fucking clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the 707 headband, which is a
Mandelbrot seed creation that he used off
[SPEAKER_00]: the mother cut that I still have,
the LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of what I consider to be
OG Kush-type phenos, which is the 56 and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Loompa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old school guys that first had the
diesel too in the headband, they think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dead and they're suspect that it
could exist on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of things, there's mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loompa's is- There was one major claim
that Duke had bought it from Chemdog,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I specifically asked Chemdog about it
and he said he's never grown headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that when Duke and Homie
tried to work for your buddy, Matt Elite,
[SPEAKER_00]: that he got it in that little arrow when
he was in Colorado and had no previous
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cut that he uses is a suit and it's a
super, super nice, very potent cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a Kush cut and it's not diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the original headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa's headband is a cut that he got
under suspicious circumstances and renamed
[SPEAKER_00]: it after himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Matteo, yeah, Hemphill worked with the
Elite crew, Dave and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be exactly what we're talking
about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemphill, Duke, IC Collective,
probably Skunk VA, they all have that cut
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of got pushed around the bay a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got it in 06 maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's not original headband and
yeah, Duke got it when he worked with Matt
Elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob Hemphill in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not saying nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get blamed for every time Duke's names
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got Jack's Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know shit about Jack's Cleaner,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main experience with it is via NCGA's
work with Jack's Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used it for Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very cleaner, lemon cleaner type
scent profile, very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Narrowleaf, super resinous, super fucking
resinous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it bred true for that resin type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that all through TGA's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know very much about Killer Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it was a big building block in
Subcool's world, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think maybe Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if Killer Queen was in
Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have some stories about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of that Grimm Brothers Grimm,
right?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Vic High.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on Grimm work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on Grimm work.
[SPEAKER_01]: C99 Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Airborne G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: C99 Romulan, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say Vic High was one of the most
well-known early forum, early internet
[SPEAKER_00]: weed personalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a super nice cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super smart, super intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intelligent, smart, really made a name for
himself on the early forums and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow and Cannabis World and that whole
era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never worked with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a real smart cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it got popular off that,
I believe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lone Star, who did the blue bonnet that I
work with, also had a killer cut of Killer
[SPEAKER_01]: Queen that would go around big yielder,
very C99 type dominant, but had more
[SPEAKER_01]: fruity turps from all the other shit in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Killer Queen that was later
done with supposedly the Pacific G13 by
[SPEAKER_01]: Motor Rebel that was very different from
the original Killer Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the original Killer Queen was a VCE
original, and it's still used to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a good one.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call it Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call it Lemon G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a really good buddy, Pip,
who cropped that one for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on that citrus level where I view
most citrus as sort of two-one note for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a big yielding, kind of ugly,
long-running colas plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of one of those weeds that
people love for two or three days and then
[SPEAKER_00]: get burned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge fan of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smell lemon G and everything lemon G
is in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Tree, I'm convinced, is a lemon
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon G hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super obvious to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the prettiest bud at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would consider it, post-Cookie era,
I would consider it ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It burns nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really heavily cropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of extract people love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, M39.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can never fucking remember the code
names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk 1, NL5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just Skunk 1, NL5,
but it might be a Skunk 1, NL5 phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the case, I will say that when
we talked to Karel, he was extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: honest and upfront about a lot of various
different subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did get a little cagey when I asked him
about that and the basic five and if he
[SPEAKER_00]: got any seed stock from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of just called it by different
names at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He laughed and smiled and didn't say a
whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't really get any specifics from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no indication that he got any
private NL stock from anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you going to say about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Massachusetts Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one has been described in other
podcasts and stuff quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an enormous amount of confusion
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attained legendary status,
especially because some of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are involved in it are very famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially since that rank,
Roadkill Skunk seems to be the scam of the
[SPEAKER_00]: minute where for the last five or six
years, people keep claiming that their
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk turps are going to blow you out of
the water and it's right around the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it because the guy that went and got
it from Virginia crew brought it west and
[SPEAKER_00]: gave it to when Jerry Garcia died and
Skunk Thier started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the cut from our buddy and started
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posted some pictures of it on his page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's in Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not really from
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got dropped off there by my buddy when
he got the chem dog from Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about it is that
the cut when when Skunk Thier went east
[SPEAKER_00]: and got the Chem D and brought it back
when we gave when Greg got the dog back.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that point, according to to our buddy,
he had already lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Massachusetts Super Skunk that
they posted in the in the high times was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot shorter, was a lot squatter,
was a lot different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one I believe is the mom of
Jeezel because Jeezel is a spitting image
[SPEAKER_00]: of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to bring that up in the sense
that it's more than likely bag seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's one of those ones where nobody
really wants to claim the truth on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people keep popping up swearing
that they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of MS, it's one of those ones where
it's like there's a massive demand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never seen anyone that I grew it
from probably 90, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: late 90s to oh, eight ish or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen a jar of it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone that claims that they
have rank skunk and it's going to pop in
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never you know, and you would think
that it's so popular and people so want
[SPEAKER_00]: those skunk turps that all these various
breeders and stuff that claim that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to you're going to find a bunch of
skunk in their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's one of those legendary
cuts now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most people got rid of it because it
smelled like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the the Massachusetts Super
Skunk, I will say this isn't super well
[SPEAKER_00]: known, but it is not pure super skunk
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bred through various skunky things
that SSC SSC had and Neville had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when Neville released the super
skunk, they crossed that that line that
[SPEAKER_00]: they already had to the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phenos of that are what became famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's the latest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The information that we got from one of
our members of our crew got directly from
[SPEAKER_01]: the gutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy who bought or bred the mass super.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an aspect where, you know,
there's like like we were just talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about with the headbands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mystery history allows various people to
make wild claims thinking that it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: ever get popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out to California with my friend
when the same time you brought the chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog out and it survived amongst our crew
and he grew it for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to Colorado through that that
breeders other friends and it got called
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk six out there after the the the
number of the feed of the number of the
[SPEAKER_00]: female, you know, that they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a lot of legend to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's probably in it's in my
opinion, it's probably in Kim D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably it's deaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's in sour and a lot of people
want it and it seems to not exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe it exists in various
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it pops up one day, but more people
have been excited about selling the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then making sure they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been excited about selling the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say one other thing that,
you know, Neville always said that his two
[SPEAKER_00]: best selling things were super skunk and
an NL five hates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's probably a lot of super skunk
out there blended into various things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I personally think that super
skunk is a lot of a people refer to as
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky day that went around in their area
was probably, if you know, super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm damn near convinced of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: After seeing stuff like the old P. Ninety
one, my Airman Afghani line, just an old
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani line that happened to be from
Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very super skunk like the clockwork
cut all kinds of shit around me was super
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was what I navigated to.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask how the hell could it have
disappeared?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most skunk, you know, people think about
this crazy turpentine and I will say that
[SPEAKER_00]: it had the turpentine spades, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredibly stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only moderate potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only moderate density.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have this big ass bud and you'd
put it on the scale and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's going to be six or seven grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'd be like two and a half,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pre carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got a lot of people in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember driving up to my house
a bunch in summer and like parking in my
[SPEAKER_00]: driveway and I could just smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it was, you know,
like I said earlier in the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: other things get more popular and people
drop shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they think, Oh, I can always get
it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else is holding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else is holding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, eh, you know,
people can't find it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it exists in a lot of children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think it's in sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell it in sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can even see it in sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's from my buddy sub Rob,
the Matanuska Valley Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a cool story about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds to me like the Matanuska
Valley Thunderfuck ends up being kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like Crippie or diesel or something like
that in terms of it was like a name for
[SPEAKER_00]: fireweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was on dead tour, there was a
buddy of ours that was from Alaska and was
[SPEAKER_00]: on tour and he would go home to Alaska in
between tours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him one time I gave him like
$1,200 for a quarter pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he didn't give me any weed for
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought he jacked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he called me up and he said,
Hey, I'm going to send you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me this weed and it showed up
in the mail and it was wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took it out and I dried it and it
was only like three and a half ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lost like a half ounce of weight and
it was three and a half, four months late.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said it was Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was olive dark green with these
weird hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddies and I kept it in the freezer
and we smoked it only for special
[SPEAKER_00]: occasions over the next six or eight
months.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great high, great buzz, much better weed
than anything we had at the time as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: kind bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, this is when I was 17,
18, 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone that's claimed Matanuska
Thunderfuck since then, none of it has
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it looked like the weed that I got
back then one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's like everyone's story that
I've met.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people from Alaska that I
think are very convinced that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the Matanuska Thunderfuck that
they had was the original and the only,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can tell you all about it,
you know, who grew it, who made it,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of stories like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it, I think they're
probably all telling their own truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I will say too, that the,
the package that I got mailed was mailed
[SPEAKER_00]: from Denali, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post office.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I thought I got ripped off for
months because I gave him 1200 bucks and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't see any weed for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept his, he kept the funny thing
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a side,
side tangent, but he kept his,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was a native to Alaska and he kept his
license and all that from Alaska because
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska native Alaskans got oil money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though he was on dead tour and he
was like in the lower 48, most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year, he would keep all of his shit at his
parents' house and just go back there in
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would get like between a two and a
$5,000 check every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that fucking wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends in high school got
shipped out to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were a bunch of punk rock kids and he
got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got in a lot of trouble one day doing
some punk rock things and got shipped out
[SPEAKER_01]: to Alaska for a few years and he came back
and he was the first person to like talk
[SPEAKER_01]: to me about some strain that was like,
he's like, bro, hugest THC numbers ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the Matanuska Valley
Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had this big tail of this very
special potent weed that was out there in
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always trying to figure out more
about this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I kept digging deeper and deeper,
I learned that there were several people
[SPEAKER_01]: with several claims to several
Thunderfucks out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you dig into it, the wider the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of bikers involved in most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to say if it was a one thing
or it was just a regional name like Maui
[SPEAKER_00]: Waui, like Crippie, even my buddies,
everyone thinks about diesel as sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel now, but you know, in the mid
nineties or whatever, the only reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: it got called sour diesel was because the
guy wrote our diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because diesel was slang for fire weed in
New York city in that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friends that lived there said that
you got all kinds of diesels because that
[SPEAKER_00]: was the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Thunderfuck is a bit like
that, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard of sour diesel being
called the cock diesel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard that?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked to almost everyone at
length in the sour diesel original family,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I never heard cock diesel,
but you know, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why that's in my memory bank,
but yeah, that's one of the names of my
[SPEAKER_01]: memory bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a secret they kept amongst
the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few of the boys, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few, just a few of the bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're almost two hours in and we are
only like a portion of the way through
[SPEAKER_01]: this list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll probably be a few episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to announce a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Breeder Syndicate 2.0 up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the audio podcast is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of new things are rolling with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's available on any podcast software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you look for the new logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's white and pink right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're developing some other new logos that
are pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of new cool things going on
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the Breeder Syndicate Patreon where
we all hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come hang out with us there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a discord and we're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all the time taking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: For seeds, there's riotseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have my seeds and my reversal spray
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natso, anything you want to plug?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really big on plugging publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I will say like as always that
like I, I'm super stoked that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely trying to bring like
culture and history.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mostly what we're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of like podcasts end up
being sort of like infomercials about
[SPEAKER_00]: people, which isn't necessarily bad,
but like there's a lot more diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world, cannabis culture,
you know, historical that isn't like just
[SPEAKER_00]: about making people look good,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always appreciate people coming out,
you know, and you know, you always can
[SPEAKER_00]: reach, you can always reach me through DM
on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always reach me on, I answer a lot
of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get, I get swamped,
you know, I have a life too and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we are, we are thinking
about, you know, one of the reasons why we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about some of these old things is
that we think they're going to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: comeback perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thinking about, you know,
doing some like, doing some, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been really a public reader and
I'm, Matt has been trying to convince me
[SPEAKER_00]: to open myself up to lots of criticism and
hate and people throwing things at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write his, I write his phone number in
every bathroom stall I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so people, so, but then there's
a lot of things that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always bred for stuff that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking about maybe,
you know, doing some, doing or releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff that might be very different
than what is currently out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if people would be into
it or not, but it's, it's always been sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of a, you know, a passion thing for me or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, well, how far did we get on
the fucking list, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got pretty far in, but there's a lot
that like people are talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I've been writing down that I want to
go back and touch on too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I will say there was a,
there was a shit ton of really good
[SPEAKER_00]: questions this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them I missed because it's,
it's, you might, it's like rubbing your
[SPEAKER_00]: head and patting your stomach at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to like talk
intelligently in a flowing form and then
[SPEAKER_00]: think about like four or five cool
questions all at the same time that you
[SPEAKER_00]: see scroll by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt's been taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try to get, we'll try to expand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this show is, you know, as much as
it's about us talking about random weed
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that we do all week anyway,
it's for you guys too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit us up all the time with questions
or, you know, or ideas or thoughts on like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you might want to hear, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I'm not, I'm not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, you know, Caleb, Matt,
other people, they've been trying for
[SPEAKER_00]: years to not only get me to talk,
but to get me to like publicly release
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's kind of a bitch being
a public reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been kind of hesitant to like open
myself up to like a bunch of criticism and
[SPEAKER_00]: assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I might, I don't know, you know,
there's a lot of, there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that get passed over with fads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we are almost at two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe we could, we're thinking
about having Sean next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could continue this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could, you know, two hours is kind of
long, but maybe we will figure out a
[SPEAKER_00]: format to do the rest of them fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a part of the Patreon and
the Discord and you want to give us some
[SPEAKER_01]: other ideas for other clones, you'd like
to hear about from that era, just throw it
[SPEAKER_01]: up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Discord is definitely a much
easier way for us to converse back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth, especially individual, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you don't have to,
but it just, it's, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always reach out to IG,
but sometimes I get buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we try to keep it to two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll, we'll keep this going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad everybody liked chatting about
old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, we super appreciate your Friday
night and everyone have a killer weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
