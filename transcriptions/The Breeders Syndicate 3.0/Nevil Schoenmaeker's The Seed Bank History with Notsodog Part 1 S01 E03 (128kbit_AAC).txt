[SPEAKER_01]: Ready, go!
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder Cinegate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, bud?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just start rolling, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the first edition of our new
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where we want to begin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought maybe this thing would be good
to talk about like some seed bank history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously like now there's a lot
of stuff that's kind of coming out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: woodwork where people are talking about a
lot of famous old cuts from the 80s and
[SPEAKER_03]: 90s seed lines and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that like there was a bunch
of people that didn't maybe didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the history behind all how all
that occurred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so obviously, since it's weed history,
it's not entirely exact, but this is
[SPEAKER_03]: everything we're going to talk about is
the best that we know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be some different information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything could be entirely correct,
but we're going to give it our best shot
[SPEAKER_03]: to give you what we think and what we know
and all that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason why we wanted to start with
like sort of Neville and sort of Holland
[SPEAKER_03]: history is that's not where like seed
history started, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was stuff going on in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was sacred.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was plenty of private readers,
but in Holland, that was sort of the first
[SPEAKER_03]: place where you could literally be a
nobody and just send them money and get
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of in California, at least from my
knowledge and experience, you kind of had
[SPEAKER_03]: to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of had to be connected a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you had to be within certain
circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, you know, I grew up in the
Midwest and there was no access to seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no culture or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only places that we knew how to get
weed were dead shows and home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you could mail order from Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could you could fly out there and buy
them directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then kind of try to bring them back
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, that's kind of where like modern
weed history, as far as like most people's
[SPEAKER_03]: access to it begins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were in certain circles,
if you were in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, obviously it starts
before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Neville put an ad in High Times in 84
or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that started what Matt's holding up
right now is his 85 catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because Holland's because Holland's
laws had changed, then they were sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: the first place that could like really
make seeds available to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a result of that, like that's where
a lot of people got most of their seed
[SPEAKER_03]: stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't from connections.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't from friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were small groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Neville, SSSC, you know,
a couple other small places.
[SPEAKER_03]: They allowed everybody, people from
Florida, people from Chicago, people from
[SPEAKER_03]: New York, people from North Carolina,
Virginia, wherever to just if they had the
[SPEAKER_03]: balls to go there, they had the balls to
order it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's where that's where kind of
like our modern story starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where like a lot of a lot of
seed strains and a lot of lines that
[SPEAKER_03]: became famous to everybody like Hayes,
Northern Lights, Skunk One, G13,
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple Leaf, all these things we talk about
now that have become kind of legendary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really where like 99 percent of the
population really first started getting
[SPEAKER_03]: access to it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Neville is kind of unique in
cannabis history in that he had the balls
[SPEAKER_03]: to start it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sort of got to as you know,
by the mid 80s, persecution in California
[SPEAKER_03]: and America in general had really kind of
ramped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Reagan years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drug laws had gotten intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of a lot of breeders and a
lot of growers and a lot of guys with
[SPEAKER_03]: seed, they sort of took what they had and
they fled to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Amsterdam basically got famous
because it was able to collect a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that was going on in America,
not so much stuff it had itself,
[SPEAKER_03]: but really stuff that was going on in
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did do some trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly true that Neville,
the drunkers from Sensi, other people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, some people went to Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was shit that they called obviously
the hippie hashish trail where people
[SPEAKER_03]: started going to the Far East and poking
around looking for seed stock and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but Holland is really where it
consolidated like Matt's holding it up
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look on the left page that he has
up, there's like an order form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could literally write down what
amount you wanted of what strains and you
[SPEAKER_03]: could send them fucking money and they
would send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was pretty revolutionary,
I think, because that had never happened
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't just ask a stranger for a
bunch of a bunch of illegal marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: beans and get a hold of them back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we thought maybe it would be good
to start like on a historical basis,
[SPEAKER_03]: because most of the stuff that we grow
today in some way, there's a lot you could
[SPEAKER_03]: trace a lot of it back to that first five
or 10 years in Amsterdam, say like 85 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Matt would agree that the vast
majority of today's modern cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can at least tie some of it back to
that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so Neville did two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville had the balls to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then secondly, he was kind of able to
collect a bunch of people's previous work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for instance, Mel Frank,
Jim Ortega, Seattle Greg from the NL crew,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Sam Skunkman, various groups
like that, and then his own travels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he kind of became the first person
to be able to blend all those things
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like before him, nobody was crossing skunk
in Northern Lights because the skunk crew
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Northern Lights crew didn't know
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody was crossing an L5, you know,
with Hayes because that crew didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way he got lucky because I mean,
like imagine today, for instance,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could collect, nobody knew about Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew about cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew about sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew about all these things that
are famous in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And imagine you got to be the person that
blended them together first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sold and then resold them to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that's kind of like what that's
kind of what Neville got to do in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is you got to be first, you know,
and a bunch of people copied them and a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of people came along and added their
own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, like just like every other
breeder, nobody started shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's on the shoulders of who came
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you all pick up, you know, the breeding
projects and the clones and the seeds as
[SPEAKER_03]: you get into weed, as you come around and
then, you know, you kind of add your own
[SPEAKER_03]: picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what every breeder has done,
you know, from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, the first breeders in say
like America were taking all the import
[SPEAKER_03]: weed, like the Colombian and the
Panamanian and the Thai and the Mexican
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that and all that stuff came in
from seed, you know, seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So literally every time you bought weed,
you got free seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so most most breeding in America was a
bunch of sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's all there was, was sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you got hash, hash was Afghans,
but you didn't find any seeds for the most
[SPEAKER_03]: part in hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a really super important
part, too, because most people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: around today don't realize that the influx
of modern Afghanis and stuff happened more
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 80s, late 70s, early 80s,
as opposed to have always been existing
[SPEAKER_00]: and always a part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most I would say, for instance,
that like most most things that people
[SPEAKER_03]: were growing in the 70s was a blend of
sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because that's what that's what
everybody had access to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it'd be Mexican Colombians,
it'd be Mexican Colombians and Thais,
[SPEAKER_03]: it'd be all these type of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Afghans were super fucking rare,
like really rare because somebody had to
[SPEAKER_03]: go to Afghanistan or Pakistan or one of
those regions get seeds and they had to go
[SPEAKER_03]: in the 60s and 70s when travel took a long
time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to go, they had to collect them
and they had to smuggle them back into
[SPEAKER_03]: America, either mailing them or on their
person somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but there was literal tons and tons and
tons of Mexican and Colombian and Thai and
[SPEAKER_03]: Panamanian and all these different
Jamaican that was coming in and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in bricks and stuff to America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was all seeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that was kind of like the
and so as a result of that, most American
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding was like in core groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just little groups of people,
friend groups, extended friend groups,
[SPEAKER_03]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, you know, so that's kind of
how it started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really, I mean, it really wasn't
until Holland that most of America got
[SPEAKER_03]: access to like a lot of little groups of
people were up to doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously, like prohibition was pretty
heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you just there was no way
for you to know what Seattle, Greg and the
[SPEAKER_03]: NL crew was doing in the Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were trying to avoid getting busted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Greg's commented several times that it
was just like watching dominoes fall
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly watching their friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sketchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as a result of it being sketchy,
and you trying to be underground.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That meant that most people didn't have
access to what you were doing because they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't want most people to know what they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to in order to be successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was there was,
you know, some stuff going on in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_03]: County and Humboldt County and,
you know, Santa Cruz and the Central Coast
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was mountainous and, you know,
people were getting away with pretty good
[SPEAKER_03]: sized things and breeding and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unless you were connected to those
crews, if you lived in Nebraska,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you lived in Florida, if you lived in,
you know, Chicago, like where I was born
[SPEAKER_03]: or anything like that, you had zero access
to those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had no idea whatsoever what was going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just had, you know, if you were lucky,
you got some imports.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason why we thought starting with
Neville and starting with the seed banks
[SPEAKER_03]: is because Neville was really Neville was
probably one of the biggest reasons why
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sold between he had when he started the
seed bank, you know, he sold millions of
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars worth of seed, millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All over America, all over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what he did is he gave thousands
and thousands and thousands of people the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to grow their own and the ability
to get some of the best American genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: that were happening that people didn't
have access to before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, in a way, you know,
he kind of took a lot of very famous weed
[SPEAKER_03]: characters and he made their stuff famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is really kind of what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made it famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made some rock stars, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was talking about it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody was listening to like,
you know, the first Breeders Syndicate
[SPEAKER_03]: interview, Matt and Konza got to interview
Seattle Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that Seattle Greg
said in that interview was that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he sent a Neville a whole bunch
of NLC because he saw that advertisement
[SPEAKER_03]: that Neville put in that in high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: He literally, you know, reached out to
Neville and, you know, he sent Neville
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, within five or six years of
that time, everybody in the Northern Light
[SPEAKER_03]: crew has gotten busted and it would have
been lost to time and nobody would have
[SPEAKER_03]: known anything about it other than some
legends.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he had gotten it to Holland before
they all got busted and lost it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's a there's a thing
when people are asking questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten to the questions yet
because I just been kind of rapping about
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a button where people can go
and they can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll try to get some of those
questions answered a little bit later
[SPEAKER_03]: after we roll through some of this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I'm in my mid 40s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, literally, like I said
before, I knew how to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew how to get good weed from Grateful
Dead shows and Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went to Holland in 1994.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I was able just as an 18
year old, nobody to just walk into various
[SPEAKER_03]: places and buy seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I didn't know anything about I
knew barely anything about growing weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally got my first seeds that I had
access to because I could buy a plane
[SPEAKER_03]: ticket and I could fly to Amsterdam as a
kid and I could buy seeds and I could
[SPEAKER_03]: bring them back to my spot and we could
pop them and we could see what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it still super expensive for the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like modern times
comparatively, how were the seed prices
[SPEAKER_00]: back then when you first flew over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have to save forever?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the funny part about it is,
is that seed prices, like when you look in
[SPEAKER_03]: those old catalogs, in all honesty,
you know, you see a lot of stuff for 50
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks, 80 bucks, 150 bucks, 200 bucks,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to realize the way money works
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just give you guys for an example of
inflation.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1994, when I turned 18, $20 back then
would be worth $38 today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So seed prices have stayed amazingly
stable over the decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really haven't jumped because if you
think about it, most, if you were selling
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds at what Neville was selling seeds
for, most seed packs should be between two
[SPEAKER_03]: to $400.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, just even to equate how much actual
money Neville was getting for selling
[SPEAKER_03]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, they've stayed pretty
stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously there's something,
there's cookies, there's some,
[SPEAKER_03]: when Skittles came out, there's some
people that really profited off people's
[SPEAKER_03]: availability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they've charged,
you know, 500, 800, a thousand dollars a
[SPEAKER_03]: pack for certain beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, seed prices for most
things, like if you buy stuff from CSI or
[SPEAKER_03]: you buy stuff from Riot or you,
you know, other good breeders that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we like, like Shaw and different
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're amazingly competitively priced,
you know, to today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of like the, that was kind
of a long-winded way to basically say this
[SPEAKER_03]: hour or some change or however long we
decide to shoot the shit is basically
[SPEAKER_03]: about like maybe giving some people some
information about how Neville got started
[SPEAKER_03]: and how he collected things and then how
he started blending things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how those things sort of became
like, the bedrock of modern cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's the guy that really took it
from very few hands, relatively speaking,
[SPEAKER_03]: to crowdsourcing it, if you will,
to use a modern term, where all of a
[SPEAKER_03]: sudden a ton of people had access to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that would have happened
without Neville and some others and
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, maybe that's sort of the, that's sort
of the beginning, you know, and we can
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of walk it through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Matt right now is holding up the first
actual real seed catalog, which has a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of cool pictures of Neville's
Afghanistan trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's holding a bunch of hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hanging out with people in the tribal
regions of Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so basically when,
when Neville first started, he didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: shit of what he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really didn't, he didn't know anything
that he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just collecting stuff from people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was starting to blend those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say it probably took him about
three years or so of fucking around,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, 85, 84, 85, 86, going into 87 before
he really started to figure out like what
[SPEAKER_03]: he had and favorites of what he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then kind of like 88, 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's really when like the blends
started happening that got made really
[SPEAKER_03]: famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you look in, um, if you look in
the book, the very first book,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, in the Northern lights,
Greg and those guys sent him like Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: lights labeled one through eight,
but he, you weren't able to buy an L one
[SPEAKER_03]: from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't buy an L two.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't buy an L anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bought a random assortment of NL that
he had because he hadn't had time to like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he inbred those things line by
line, but it took them a few years to
[SPEAKER_03]: really figure out what he had or then grow
rooms of the stuff and even see what was
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to realize too, that like to him,
these are just names that are coming in
[SPEAKER_03]: from these different growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we have a lot of knowledge
about what these things are supposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: be, you know, but he didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the first couple of years,
there was a bunch of, there was a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, in, for lack of a better term,
you know, there's random Nepalese by
[SPEAKER_03]: skunks, you know, Colombians by this
African too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there, there was just a bunch of
stuff because he was sort of reselling,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, everything, you know, everything that
he had and he didn't really have,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, he didn't really have a way to
differentiate that, you know, so he was
[SPEAKER_03]: just experimenting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll see a lot of weird things in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a page, um, you know,
he, yeah, he's got some, some tie by,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, by, uh, Afghani, you know,
New Mexico, Afghani.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had stuff that you'd never see again,
like skunk one by, by NL nine,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, or NL eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he had Mazar Mazari that he got from
his travels to Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had Nepalese, um, route, route or
Alice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of just a grab bag in the
beginning of just whatever, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he was kind of collecting from
all these different breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so, uh, you know, they,
um, you know, and the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, and also just to go back for a
second, just to give people an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was collecting all that,
uh, Greg Greg, uh, Seattle Greg sent him,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, I believe NL one through eight,
uh, according to Neville, um, and Greg
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, you know, David Watson,
who people call Sam the skunk man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had gotten in trouble a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he took a bunch of seed stock from
himself, uh, and then some, from some
[SPEAKER_03]: other breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he brought that to Holland and he
ended up selling it to, uh, Neville,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, selling it to, uh, the owner of
positronics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we're not, uh, we're not we're not,
yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Positron, the owner of positronics,
we're not, um, he ended up just basically,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he had a couple of kids or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was kind of brokeish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he ended up going out there and he
gave Neville skunk one and Hayes from
[SPEAKER_03]: himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he was friends with Mel Frank and
Mel Frank had given him Afghani one and
[SPEAKER_03]: Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then another breeder in the Bay
who we don't know his name had given,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, some, some other Afghans and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so 85, 86 Neville was basically just
reselling a bunch of stuff that he was
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting, a bunch of different breeders
that he had gotten.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, let's, let's start point over
some of the baselines that came out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the baselines that we see in a lot
of modern cannabis lines today.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll start, maybe we'll start
with, uh, something simple like Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, if you look in the 85 catalog
and you look in the 86 blog, not sure,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe even the 87, but my memory fails me
slightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you really can just buy Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says cannabis Indica Northern
Lights in the 86 and in 87, it just says
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis Indica Northern Lights as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just says Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got it in 80.
[SPEAKER_03]: He placed that ad in 84.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got the seed sometime in 84.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, we're not exactly sure when he
kept, he started growing them out and he
[SPEAKER_03]: started keeping the lines separate and
interbreeding them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you guys send to the podcast
with Greg McAllister, uh, Seattle Greg,
[SPEAKER_03]: as we like to call them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, he basically said,
that like, you know, the NL one and the NL
[SPEAKER_03]: two and the NL three, um, those were all
pretty predominantly Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were rated by height and length of
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then most of the other, most of the
other NLs were those couple Afghans,
[SPEAKER_03]: either one or two blended with basically
every sativa they could get their hands
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hawaiians, um, you know, uh, Colombians
ties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really a hodgepodge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Greg has mentioned that they were
really scared to keep notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and they were really scared to like
lay out exactly what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of those lines are kind of lost
to time in terms of what their exact
[SPEAKER_03]: makeup is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, because those guys didn't even want to
keep track.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just trying to find good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of them is a mystery, but if you
look in those first few catalogs,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said before, you can find,
you know, uh, skunk one by NL,
[SPEAKER_03]: NL nine, you can find, um, you know,
five by eight, if you will, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can find a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started reading them together and
combining them, you know, in various,
[SPEAKER_03]: in various different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in the beginning, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, everybody's familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are familiar with what he
ended up using, which is one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that became pretty famous, which is NL
five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but the first year he offered it,
he reversed it and he, and he,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was NL two by NL five, um,
because he hadn't really decided yet on
[SPEAKER_03]: like what, you know, what worked for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after a few years of, of fucking around
with NL, he basically realized that,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, NL one read pretty true to itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty close to what we call Steve
Murphy after Afghanistan, uh, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: basically the Afghani that sort of got the
NL, uh, line on its way.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got these Afghan seeds from this guy
named Steve Murphy, uh, who wrote a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis books in the mid seventies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was sort of a wide leafed short
squat kind of bubble-like, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: lowland Afghan, leafy, frosty,
resinous, short, uh, quick flowering,
[SPEAKER_03]: thick, dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the NL two was, um, you know,
more of a Kush type.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had thinner leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one thing that people should know is
like Afghanistan has an enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: height variation, depending on where you
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the stuff like the Mazars and
some of the regions might only be like one
[SPEAKER_03]: or 2000 feet above sea level.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when you get up into like the
Hindu Kush region, the Hindu Kush region
[SPEAKER_03]: is the second highest mountain range next
to the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of those Afghan farmers were
growing at like 6,000, 8,000 feet,
[SPEAKER_03]: these big tall valleys in the middle of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those leaves were kind of much
skinnier, much thinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, think about like everybody's pretty
familiar probably with like the way that
[SPEAKER_03]: like what modern push looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like that skinny three leaf,
um, you know, with different nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where like the lowland Afghans were
sort of like thick, feathery, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: denser, looser, more, more leafy nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Matt's holding up in the picture
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's 89.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it 89?
[SPEAKER_03]: The first catalog, Matt, where all of a
sudden he had figured out which NLs really
[SPEAKER_03]: worked for him, which ones were stable,
which ones gave them good breeding work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after getting all those NLs,
all the NLs pretty much disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Neville's catalogs, except for he
offered NL1 F3.
[SPEAKER_03]: He offered NL2 F3.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then he found, he grew up a bunch
of five and since five is so famous,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe we'll chat about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this dude named Kirby who,
uh, um, who took Steve Murphy's Afghan and
[SPEAKER_03]: he crossed that to a Hawaiian,
which he said was a Colombian by Mexican.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, and he gave that to
Greg and Greg sent that seed line out as
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the one through eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Neville grew a bunch of that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously if you're growing a bunch of
Afghan by Colombian by Mexican,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to get a bunch of,
uh, of variety and chaos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he found this one, maybe if you want to
show that one NL5 pick again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let me find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within the first few years, he grew up a
bunch of this NL5 and most of it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: chaotic mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Afghani sativa blend all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that picture that you guys are seeing
on the left, he found this one,
[SPEAKER_03]: he called it like a throwback plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he found this one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was almost pure Afghan, super frosty,
super resinous, didn't taste like much,
[SPEAKER_03]: super low terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it, uh, it had great structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a great buzz and, uh, he loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think by 88, 89, 90, the only
thing that Neville was really breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: with was you could buy NL1, you could buy
NL2 and he had one cut that Matt just
[SPEAKER_03]: showed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to realize for a second that in
America, they didn't have Neville's NL5
[SPEAKER_03]: cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent Neville a cut of their favorite,
but theirs was a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's was that when it was an F1 hybrid
of Steve Murphy Afghan by Colombian and
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexican.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and so, you know, there was,
there's a lot of confusion about NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have this thing that we call
pre-pre where a lot of people like to,
[SPEAKER_03]: like to talk about how they have seeds or
they have cuts like from the earliest
[SPEAKER_03]: possible time you could have the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people need to, people need to
understand that there was always,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, there was a North American cut of NL5
that was an Afghani hybrid of with Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a cut that Neville found
amongst the seed line that is that picture
[SPEAKER_03]: right there that looks super Afghan and
super frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, by 88, 89, almost all the NL
you're going to get is he used NL1 and NL2
[SPEAKER_03]: as males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And NL5 was always the, the, the female.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: After three, four years of breeding with
NL, he had decided that most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativa, most of the hybrids that were with
Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Greg had sent were a fucking mess and
hard to breed with and didn't breed
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got to realize too,
that back then during the high prohibition
[SPEAKER_03]: times, people wanted consistent producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to joke that if he gave you some
kind of white hot fire, but it yielded 10%
[SPEAKER_03]: less, you'd be pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so most, he found that like most pure
Afghans didn't cross very well together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they liked being crossed with,
that was one of the, he was one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: first people that really realized that
when you start crossing things and start
[SPEAKER_03]: getting really neat stuff, when you start
crossing things that are totally unrelated
[SPEAKER_03]: to one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so people should realize there never
was an NL5 line that was ever released
[SPEAKER_03]: pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we see that all the time,
people popping up with NL5 saying they
[SPEAKER_00]: have the NL5 cut or NL5 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the, the NL5 cut that was
made famous because people were buying
[SPEAKER_03]: millions of dollars worth of hybrids of it
really, that was in Europe, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Greg has stated that by the
late eighties, they had all gotten busted
[SPEAKER_03]: and lost all their shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't really share very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg told us that they had shared the
eight cut of the eight cut of the nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with a few friends, they had shared
the five, but that wasn't the super
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani five cut Neville shows in those
pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the F1 hybrid that was Colombian,
Mexican, and Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, everything that Neville sold was
an NL5 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had NL5 by NL2.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had NL5 by Skunk1.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had NL5 by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, can you think of any more,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as NL5 process, NL5 Hayes,
NL5 by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: One.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are three most common, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, a lot of people are
talking about having pure NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that'd be really fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Greg says that they lost it all by
the late eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Neville never sold pure NL5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there and, and by pure, uh,
to be clear, he grew out a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds that Greg sent him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the NL5 wine was a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he found this one Afghani plant he
liked a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one he used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, you know, you see a lot of stuff,
you know, I see some comments,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, talking about Bodhi stuff
and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's tough because I'm not here to
like, you know, call anybody out or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or obviously there's a lot of people
making a lot of claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, that's part of the
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of the reason why we
wanted to do these podcasts and these
[SPEAKER_03]: talks is because most of the history is
oral, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's not written down very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even the people that were there
disagree exactly on what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some consensus, but there's also,
uh, there's also some disagreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of these old timers, they don't
like each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have beefs and they have disagreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not very different than
today, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's breeders today that don't like
each other and they have beefs with each
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 20 years from now there'll be legends
about both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll be like, Oh, I thought Matt
Ryan was a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a fucking this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe him at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there'll be other people will be
like, well, that riot story was
[SPEAKER_03]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: This other guy's story wasn't consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people weren't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we're trying to do with this
is just kind of lay out some like basic
[SPEAKER_03]: facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually comment on the Bodhi,
uh, and all five thing, because I was,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were talking during that time a lot,
you know, we've been close friends for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and his goal with the NL five
knowing he knew that NL five was never
[SPEAKER_00]: released pure as a seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we were trying to find something
closest that we could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, he was trying to find it
and, and consulting all his friends too,
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, Hey, where do you think the best
NL five seed line would be?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would show the best representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time there was like Dr.
Atomic's Northern lights, um, which was a
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed claimant to the NL five,
you know, uh, lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was BC seeds, which was the
more popular one that had, had been around
[SPEAKER_00]: probably accepted as, as closer to
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then most that was available at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what he went with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably one of the better options
at the time, but as far as a pure NL five
[SPEAKER_00]: seed line, when you break it down,
it's that's really hard to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it never, because the only people
that had it, you know, and by pure,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's be clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: The initial NL five seed line was an
unstabilized poly-hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a mixture of Mexican, Colombian,
and, and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never stabilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never bred, it never bred true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a full on poly-hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squirrel mentioned the NL five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned, I think Neville sold NL five
by two and NL five by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, but NL was always the,
NL was always the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure most people know this,
but I'll say it anyway, just in case is
[SPEAKER_03]: that the way we talk about seeds is the
mother should always come first and the
[SPEAKER_03]: father should always come second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talk about five by two.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's using the mother of NL five and a dad
of NL two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, some people get it flipped around and
that's hella confusing because it is
[SPEAKER_03]: important to know what's the mom and
what's the dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really helps to have consistent
terminology when you're chatting about
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what about the new cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's things where it's
like, I can't, you know, when we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about kind of seed history and
stuff like that, this is all stuff that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on in the eighties and the early
nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, you know, these,
these things get legendary status and then
[SPEAKER_03]: they pop up in different generations and
by different people and different seed
[SPEAKER_03]: companies in Holland, different seed
companies in later in Canada, they start,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, they start popping out and,
um, I can answer that one actually real
[SPEAKER_03]: quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there's, there's somebody asking
question about NL five seed from Todd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we know quite a bit about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the basic story is that Greg says,
okay, that he found that they found some
[SPEAKER_03]: seed from him that he didn't know existed
for decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, after his sister, it sadly passed away
in her fridge, in her freezer,
[SPEAKER_03]: in her freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave some of those to Todd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Matt got some of those as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, um, so those, you know,
it's, it's hard to say, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg admitted that, uh, Greg admitted that
he lost everything for decades and then he
[SPEAKER_03]: finds some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his sister in his deceased sister's,
uh, fridge, uh, that were labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at best you can say that the
provenance of them is uncertain.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just uncertain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just no way to tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it is an L five, then it would be Steve
Murphy, Afghan by Mexican Columbia,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, which originally Greg referred to
as a Hawaiian, but later on he said what
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hawaiian was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Hawaiian, but you know,
I mean, obviously Hawaii doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: native speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of Hawaiian was sativas from other
traditional regions brought to Hawaii and
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how did BC seed company obtain NL
five?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of jumping around for a
minute, but let's be clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, most of the seed companies in
Amsterdam, once they realized how
[SPEAKER_03]: profitable this seed shit was,
they would buy seed from whoever had the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed in Holland, rename it and resell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, a company bought
Neville's NL two F three and they renamed
[SPEAKER_03]: it Oasis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, which company that Matt remind me,
uh, Dutch passion, Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dutch passion, you know, uh,
when this is jumping ahead a lot,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, within a year of Shanti
releasing white widow or other things,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was two or three other competing
seed companies in Holland, selling white
[SPEAKER_03]: widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would just take this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would just lift the exact lineage
from the people that's that first sold the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They buy five or 10 or 20 or however many
packs of seed from that person,
[SPEAKER_03]: grow them out, take a male and a female
and start making and packaging their own
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they get them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds have always been shady and everybody
involved in seeds has always been shady
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's already always been underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, uh, you know, it's always been
somewhat persecuted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, a lot of the characters
to be perfectly honest, why it's hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: tell what they lie about, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the provenance of a breeder is
only as good as what they can prove,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and a lot of people don't demand
that proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know to demand that proof or,
or have it even researched to demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I saw something, we'll get to some
questions here and just, we'll go through
[SPEAKER_03]: like a little question and answer session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, shortly here or whatever,
and we're not, we won't get through it all
[SPEAKER_03]: today, but I just kind of like,
you guys can see, I mean, I haven't even
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten, I haven't even talked yet about
the most famous hybrid of all time,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but there's a lot of depth to these
stories on how these people got started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, you know, and then other people
should also know that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, some of these later seed companies,
uh, a lot of these people worked for
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Adam, who was part of starting THC
seeds, Tony, who was first at cerebral and
[SPEAKER_03]: then made his own sag Martha seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simon, who was also at cerebral and then
made serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they all worked cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then within a year of leaving,
working for Neville or leaving,
[SPEAKER_03]: working for Sensi under Neville to be more
accurate, they all had their own seed
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's highly likely that at the very
least they took some stock, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: some other plants, some fathers,
some whatever from their previous job and
[SPEAKER_03]: renamed stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I mean, that's the game, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe I should take a step back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk for a few more minutes and then
we can answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other part that's cool is that one
of the things that Neville did that other
[SPEAKER_03]: people didn't is that he actually went to
America on some even clone hunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, there's a dude who has written,
most people probably know exactly who this
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's one of the people through his
books that taught me how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this dude named Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, Neville met up with Jorge
Cervantes on one of those trips back into
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, Jorge got, had new breeders,
maybe breeders is the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew growers at the very least.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew growers in the Pacific Northwest
region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jorge hooked them up with the G 13 cut
and what became known as the Pacific
[SPEAKER_03]: Northwest hash point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and so certain people gave Neville a
bunch of seed lines, but then there was
[SPEAKER_03]: things like the Pacific Northwest hash
plant, the G 13, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that, that ended up just being
straight cuts that he purchased.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and, um, you know, yeah, George wasn't
somebody he used to go by a different pen
[SPEAKER_03]: name, um, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but, uh, yeah, he, he hooked up
Neville with two cuts and really all we
[SPEAKER_03]: know is that Neville paid $500 for the G
13 cut and it came out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, I don't know how much he paid for
the Pacific Northwest hash plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he paid for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sent both those things back as
cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, he kind of collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the first five or six years,
he was in business through some travels,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, to Afghanistan from meeting up with
American greeters, uh, to going to go into
[SPEAKER_03]: America and buying cuts and seed lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't talked about that, but there
was this, uh, very mysterious character
[SPEAKER_03]: named Jim Ortega that gave him seed lines
that became super famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: The garlic bud, the Hawaiian Indica,
the, um, the maple leaf Indica,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, and, uh, uh, the Kush four,
uh, you know, and those ends up a number
[SPEAKER_03]: of those in a bunch of Neville projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so Neville kind of like, Neville kind
of like was able to, in that five year
[SPEAKER_03]: period, you know, or six year period,
really 84 to 90, he was constantly
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting stuff from breeders,
collecting stuff from people, lending it
to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting it together, releasing stuff,
playing around with stuff and seeing what
[SPEAKER_03]: the hell it was is kind of how it got
started in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you want to add any of that shit,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, actually this, this is harkening back
to people were asking about the BCC
[SPEAKER_00]: company and their sourcing actually found
something in reference to just that real
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the doctor atomic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be the hemp BCC bank,
I believe, and they don't really give an
[SPEAKER_00]: exact, um, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: On how they sourced it, but it does say,
uh, this state of the art Indica is a
[SPEAKER_00]: result over 20 years of selected
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretty much took Neville's
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds have extremely frosted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they actually sold an NL five
Hawaiian Indica and all five Hayes one
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it didn't see anything about
the sourcing of their NL five and they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't have possibly been around for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a lot to digest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kind of gives you like a super
general overview of like what,
[SPEAKER_03]: what Neville was up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, some of the people he was
collecting from and some of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that he got, um, maybe we'll pause for a
second and we'll hop over to the votes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, people are, and I'll, we'll answer
some questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to read them.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I got them in front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, this app that I downloaded works
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first question that got a bunch of
votes is, uh, getting CSI on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, CSI is, I could probably safely say
he's a good friend of both mine and
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we both, uh, chat with him,
uh, fairly often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, he, uh, we're all good
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's certainly possible that we could
convince him to come on one of these in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's not quite, he's not quite as
talkative as Matt and I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a little, uh, but he has done it
in the past and it is entirely possible
[SPEAKER_03]: that we could get him to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, people call him inspector for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's got a really curious mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: He pokes and pokes and pokes and tries to
figure out knowledge, kind of like the
[SPEAKER_03]: rest of us, everything I just said,
um, that I ramble on about for forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's it's the result literally of
years of talking to people, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: years of researching years of,
you know, uh, Matt got to talk to Neville
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a bit in 09, uh, 10, 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or so got a bunch of emails and
various kinds of communication.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there was a couple of year period on,
uh, Mr. Nice forums, which is Shanti
[SPEAKER_03]: Baba's site where Neville was actively
posting and answering a bunch of people's
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there's friends of his that have
contributed, uh, there's enemies of his
[SPEAKER_03]: that have, uh, their own various stories
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, all of this stuff is not easy
to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in any one location.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all sort of a conglomeration of,
uh, you know, it's still a lot of,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: He cares about history.
[SPEAKER_03]: He cares about, um, knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he cares about the oral history.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say when, but we can try to get,
uh, homie on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And see if he wants to chat about various
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next question is we have, like I said
before, we have no idea who passed the
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific Northwest Hash Plant to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge did arrange that, that exchange for
the PNW Hash Plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it's not public knowledge who gave
it to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just know it came out of the Oregon
Washington state area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there was growers that, that Jorge
knew that he was able to hook up with
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville and Neville bought them from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, uh, their names are not known to
my knowledge, uh, whoever they were and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the Maui cut that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, the third, that question and the
next question, what seeds that I buy in
[SPEAKER_03]: 94, did I find anything decent?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Maui cut are both related.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was dumb and I was 18 and in
retrospect, I went there and I bought a
[SPEAKER_03]: ton of seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sadly, I only bought one or two packs
of like 15 different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and not realizing at the time that I
would have been better off buying say two
[SPEAKER_03]: or three or four things, like five or six
or seven packs of each, like 20 or 30 or
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 females of each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, you know, I bought a bunch of
random shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought stuff from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I bought some stuff from, um,
I'm trying to think now, uh, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the easiest way to put it is,
uh, I didn't find anything that was
[SPEAKER_03]: worthwhile on that trip except for I was
at the gray area coffee shop and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking a joint and we were young and this
old timer was sitting down next to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, old timer in the sense,
he probably looks something like me right
[SPEAKER_03]: now in his mid forties, a little old gray,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, we were smoking and we were young
and we were all 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there with some friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like all 18 to 20 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were all hippies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dad had this mission to buy six seed and
smuggle them back so we could grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a two lighter, uh, at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really major, major player.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I was sitting down next to him,
this, this old guy smoking weed and we
[SPEAKER_03]: were telling him our story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he told me that he was from Hawaii and
he'd lived there since the mid seventies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every few years he came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And traded seeds with some of these guys
in Holland, um, and brought them back and
[SPEAKER_03]: tried them in Hawaii on Maui.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't a very long conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We drank a cappuccino.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ask him that many questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoked a couple of joints together and
a little hash or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the end of it, he was like,
well, I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kids are out here trying to find some
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, why don't you take,
why don't you try a little bit of what I
[SPEAKER_03]: do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he put a handful of seeds in my,
um, and one of those became the Maui cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I stupidly didn't make any seeds,
uh, that era.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't even attempting to breed yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to find a good female to
fill my two lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I didn't ask him any intelligent
questions about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I call it the Maui because that's
the island that came from, and that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: only thing I know about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So gorgeous though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, uh, the first time I went to
Amsterdam, I went to Amsterdam probably
[SPEAKER_03]: two or three times between 94 and Oh
three, probably two or three times a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to like three cannabis cups in that
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I would go, mostly I would go in
summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I would go, I'd try to go a couple
of times a year and buy different seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to breeders, talk to various people,
learn as much as I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to realize back then there was no
forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was just in books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Information was pretty hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, information was rudimentary
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the way the information flows now,
I wish that I could have listened to
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody like this to shoot the shit about
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but it was pretty hard to come across.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, the only thing I found on my 94
trip was a gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I bought was, I don't want to
say it was bunk, uh, but my 18,
[SPEAKER_03]: my 18 year old, uh, knowledge,
I didn't keep any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I still have that cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still grown in Mendocino County by
others.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be in some popular strains that
are around nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is definitely in some popular strains
and, uh, that cut is 27 years old this
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, uh, it's certainly my longest old
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had it my entire adult life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it, uh, paid a lot of bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought it with me when I moved from
Chicago to Mendocino County in 1998.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spread it out a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's, uh, it's been in a number of
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I bred with it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I gave some hybrids that I
had made, uh, of Superdog, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: another story that we've talked about
before, but Superdog by Maui.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave a bunch of that to Mandelbrot,
Mandelbrot, uh, for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a, you know, in that that he
called the truth, uh, and then he bred
[SPEAKER_03]: with it and some of his own lines and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, she exists in various,
she still exists pure with me and some
[SPEAKER_03]: friends, but she also exists in some other
people's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, she might exist in some pretty famous
things at this particular time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but that's kind of how cannabis is,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so there's a couple more questions I
could answer for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friend, uh, Flanville, he said,
what's my personal favorite clone or line
[SPEAKER_03]: to come from Neville's work?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the line is easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I, I personally think the most famous,
uh, hybrid ever made in the most
[SPEAKER_03]: successful cannabis hybrid that's ever
been sold is North lights five by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's another,
there's another line that's more famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if you're looking at, um, at the
catalogs right there, right out there on
[SPEAKER_03]: top of the 1990 catalog, that's that
picture of NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know which one it was?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a two, it's a five, a five,
two, a five, two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the mother of Neville's hate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That picture right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the mother of Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that cut is still alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's both in Europe and it's floating
around with a select few people in
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was found in 89 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's super old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and look at all that leaf resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, basically, um, you know,
he got, you know, it's kind of long,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he got Hayes from, uh, Sam's Dave,
Dave Watson's Sam skunk man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he ended up crossing it with some of
his Indica's, um, maple leaf Indica,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, called that silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crossed it with G 13 and you had G 13
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crossed it with NL five.
[SPEAKER_03]: That became, and the NL five, uh,
I actually don't think there's another
[SPEAKER_03]: line as well as me thinking that it's the
most famous and well-known line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's another line that
has as many named elites that still exist
[SPEAKER_03]: as that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be hard pressed to find one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably four to six, at least
famous named cuts in Europe, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: that are NL five Hayes, the PIF,
the heights Hayes, the Cuban black Hayes,
[SPEAKER_03]: the dog shit, the church, uh, all those
are all NL five is, you know, and they all
[SPEAKER_03]: come from 88 to 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another picture from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it is, uh, it's probably the most,
it's probably the most famous line that
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone has ever made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's literally eight to 10 to 12
cuts of it that are all have different
[SPEAKER_03]: names that are all elites that are all
still hoarded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and exist on both in Europe and in
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's by far the most famous
cannabis hybrid ever made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, since you have this beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you see today is sadly probably
bunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Neville worked for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole story in itself,
but Neville worked for them after he got
[SPEAKER_03]: busted and got up, they bailed him out of
jail and they gave him a great deal of if
[SPEAKER_03]: we bail you out of jail, you have to sell
us your company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, he spent like, he spent a good
chunk of time in jail and they bailed them
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since he seeds ended up absorbing,
uh, the seed bank from Neville hired
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville as their top breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Neville went from owning the biggest,
most successful seed company to having the
[SPEAKER_03]: DA after him spending about eight or nine
months in jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then having to go from being an owner
to being the head breeder for different
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that's another story,
but they ended up renaming a bunch of his
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so since he, for the first five
years in the nineties, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, that was where Neville resided and
made most of his beans and probably from
[SPEAKER_03]: 95 to 2000, they still had the vast
majority of the original, uh, lines that
[SPEAKER_03]: they were working with, uh, seed laws
changed in 99 in 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Holland and most of the original
breeders got rated and busted,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Ben and Alan drunkers are,
um, Dutch businessman for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_03]: term.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will never admit that they lost a
single plant from the originals.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get a word out of them that
anything is different than, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but most likely they lost a bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm correct, I think they farmed
out most of their work to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't made the traditional versions
of their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the, the, the timeline I always go
by is roughly 2005, 2006 is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the last time you want to buy stuff from
the majority of the Dutch seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause by then Nirvana fucking all of them
greenhouse, uh, since he, they were all
[SPEAKER_00]: farming out to Buddha seeds and eventually
to Lamota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, then see sadly since he had about a.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 10 to 15 year run of having a lot of
legitimate stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that there could be some things
in Sensei that are still real.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no idea what to know what.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do know, um, that they lost,
uh, quite a few mother plants and breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: plants over the years, but they'll never
admit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sadly no longer what they were in the
nineties, which was an excellent place to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a bunch of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will say, uh, seeds, if,
if, if people want to see what original
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes is like, Seedsman still has original
Hayes that they sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, uh, it's all, it's all
purchased from Watson, if I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know, people talk about,
you know, I might have a cutting of
[SPEAKER_00]: original Hayes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still around in seed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, we could talk endlessly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, there's a couple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: On here that are, they're easy to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said, did Skunk Va head dog use
your headband cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two headband cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, one of them we call the LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does not have that one, but there's
another headband cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that both him and, um, ICC,
uh, both have and, um, Mr. Bob Hemphill
[SPEAKER_03]: and some other people have it's much more
of a Kush based headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the headband that, that he
uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's a great cut, super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that I use as well from
Elite Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, uh, you mentioned the NL5
seed line was composed of Afghani,
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombian, and Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes this different than Skunk One?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk One is Afghani, Mexican,
and Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just totally different types of parents,
totally different lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's like saying somebody's
Italian, Irish, and Chinese, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not the same parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's just the same region of origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, certainly Sam Skunkman was not using
the NL Cruz Afghans in his lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's very unlikely that the
Mexican or the Colombians are related.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it just goes to show how,
um, different blends, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: from different parents can lead to very
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vastly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vastly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, let's see, somebody asked
about, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been talking the whole time
and that has been unusually quiet while I
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned, I still learn when we talk,
there's certain things that you said
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight that I couldn't fucking remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even, even from being the one who
talked to Greg a bunch, I still couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so let me, let me ask this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a guy that was talking about
where can one find real old school strains
[SPEAKER_03]: and genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are all these pollen chuckers with
watered down herm genetics and trash gear
[SPEAKER_03]: getting the most attention?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a couple of comments on that,
uh, for one thing, um, and this is common.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't just for weed, but,
um, you know, some people are really good
[SPEAKER_03]: at marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, for lack of a better term,
you know, you know, there's a lot,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's all throw it out there again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we get CSI on here, in my opinion,
CSI is one of the absolute best breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: that's alive today and working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think he, the amount of breeding he
does, the amount that he shows his own
[SPEAKER_03]: work, the amount that he constantly cracks
entire rooms of seed that he has made and
[SPEAKER_03]: shows people what's in the seed lines
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost nobody does that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost nobody shows as much of his own
work in pictures and you can just watch
[SPEAKER_03]: him grow after grow after grow after grow
after grow after grow on IG for years,
[SPEAKER_03]: just posting tons and tons of pits of,
you know, most breeders don't test their
[SPEAKER_03]: own work at this particular time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing your own work is time consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consuming the best way to make money as a
breeder is to make the cross, give it a
[SPEAKER_03]: killer name, make some amazing page
packaging, pump, pump, pump, pump on IG
[SPEAKER_03]: and try to get a bunch of hype going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and growing it out and testing it
takes time, money, energy, space,
[SPEAKER_03]: power bills, you know, all this different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, no, but the reason why I
mentioned CSI is because he is absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: terrible at promoting himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a phenomenal breeder that doesn't
really self promote the way other,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and so you got to separate
marketing from talent, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I should say about that is
that when people talk about herm genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: people act like herms are a bad thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and they're not, you know,
I said this on the live when Matt and I
[SPEAKER_03]: were chatting before anybody that thinks
that herms are bad is tripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Herms are inconvenient in today's
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, obviously having seeds and stuff like
that isn't the greatest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, uh, herms are just a genetic
trait that enable a plant to create seed
[SPEAKER_03]: in the event that something weird happens
and they don't get pollinated in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue the species, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: From a breeding perspective, um,
they're quite convenient to the marijuana
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, from a seedless perspective where
we're trying to grow since Amalia or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you know, however you want to
call it seedless, they're inconvenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, but the marijuana plant did
not develop with the idea that it was
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be seedless to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seedless is a failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A straight failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's trying to just like all
other life, it's trying to reproduce and
[SPEAKER_03]: survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just to be clear too,
there is a lot of the best cannabis out
[SPEAKER_03]: there that's bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really humbling as a breeder that
some of the best on the planet is
[SPEAKER_03]: accidents.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chem dog came from a bag of weed
bought at a dead show without seeds in
[SPEAKER_03]: that bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour was a multi-term accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: The super skunk that everybody's hunting
after and everybody wants, and everybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: claiming to have RKS and there's RKS
coming out of the woodwork and everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to claim like they got skunk,
skunk, skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant hermed like a mofa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hermed like crazy, but because it
hermed like crazy, if it didn't herm,
[SPEAKER_03]: there would be no sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: There would be sour diesel is,
is from accidental harms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why people have Kush,
the reason why Kush came to LA is because
[SPEAKER_03]: in Florida, somebody's room hermed and
they sold seeded weed and people found
[SPEAKER_03]: that seeded weed and they grew up some
seed and they got what we known as Kush,
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel, cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: A chem dog, you name it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, a lot of people like,
you know, jump on herms and obviously you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to buy a bunch of gear that has
tons of herms because it's inconvenient,
[SPEAKER_03]: but herms are a genetic trait like
anything else and they exist and breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: do the best they can to reduce the
incidence of herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're breeding something,
okay, nobody, you know, nobody cared that
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel hermed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fire weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tasted great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got you super fucking high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lasted a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Burned great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Kush came from a herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies came from a herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiple herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of the backbone cannabis and a
lot of the absolute most famous lines were
[SPEAKER_03]: not created intentionally at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were accidents that happened in
people's rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that doesn't mean that like you
want to get a bunch of hermy gear that
[SPEAKER_03]: sucks and makes your life crappy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, herms are inconvenient and
breeders can do the best they can to
[SPEAKER_03]: reduce her hermaphrodism traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's, I mean, Matt can speak to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's populations like Thai and other
things where herms are like prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really depends on which line
you're running and it vastly depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: the room that the parents were acclimated
in that made the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're popping seeds from a grower that
only predominantly make seeds indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to run them all outdoors,
probably not the best idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's acclimation, climate,
all that goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intersex traits are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have read against them ever since
people have been breeding cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: furs, and vanilla, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still here and they're not
going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a part of the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, man, there's a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to answer a couple more before we
leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last question is Caleb using the other
headband cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caleb is CSI and CSI has both of my
headband cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, he's a real good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust him with my whole library.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can have anything he wants from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love his breeding work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nobody put the Mendo perps,
which I got lucky enough to crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody put more genetics out there of the
Mendo perps and made it a permanent part
[SPEAKER_03]: of the gene pool more than CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he has both of my headband cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: My LA cut is a sort of a diesel type.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much more of a blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the other one is much more of a
Kush varietal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both super potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both in my kind of top five or 10
cuts that I possess.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he has both.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hasn't had them forever, but he has
started using them in various work and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can buy some of that work as we speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Nice, I'll ignore that one just
because it's a super long subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the short version is that after
Neville left Sensei, he started working
[SPEAKER_03]: with Shanti Baba and they bred together
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the result of that breeding was super
silver haze, mango haze, Neville's haze,
[SPEAKER_03]: some other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville was hurting for money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sold Shanti for a good chunk of
loot, a quarter of a million dollars or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of his seed collection from the seed
bank era in the 80s, unreleased stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: various lines and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mr. Nice, like a lot of people,
there's some people that believe that
[SPEAKER_03]: Shanti's full of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some people that believe he's a
shady character, that he's a liar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's indisputable that Neville gave
him a lot of real parents and Neville gave
[SPEAKER_03]: him or sold him his seed collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not very many people that have
indisputable evidence that they have a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of access to the old things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, there's no way to verify
what he has and what he doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a lot of debate on what he
has and there's disagreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people think he's full of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people think he's got all the white
hot fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth is probably somewhere in
between.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he has some of Neville's old
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he has a bunch of Neville's old
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say exactly what he currently
has and what he doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But his provenance and being able to
access it, I don't think is in dispute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you agree with that, Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Neville, I mean, at the very end,
it's not talked about a lot, but he felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like Shanti Babamai owe him some more
money, even though he wasn't in the
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement, because he had done so well
with Neville's line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville obviously felt that his lines
were being used correctly and making tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of money with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another thing about Australian
bastard cannabis at CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just say that real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that much about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, CSI is a true breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is really interested in freaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really interested in genetic
oddities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if nothing else, ABC is extremely odd
in the way that its leaves form and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, a lot of stuff right now is
really bottlenecked.
[SPEAKER_03]: People use the same 30, 40, 50 cuts over
and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at the very least, when you buy ABC
work, you're getting something that is
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically unique so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's certainly widening the gene pool
of available cannabis by making it
[SPEAKER_03]: available to the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is probably one of the first lines in a
long time that's totally unique from what
[SPEAKER_03]: came before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's valuable just for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an ongoing project that he's
putting a bunch of time into.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure over the next three or four
or five years, we'll see a bunch more work
[SPEAKER_03]: from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt can comment on this too, but he's
really just been getting started with his
[SPEAKER_03]: own work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see so many people get so mad every time
he posts pictures of people actually
[SPEAKER_00]: genuinely get hurt feelings when they see
this plant and they're like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is that piece of shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's surprising to me because a
lot of them claim to be breeders or our
[SPEAKER_00]: seed makers have companies that they don't
see the genetic novelty in bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: something that hasn't really touched
cannabis, you know, as far as modern life.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot, like I said, there's a lot
of sameness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say this quickly too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the breeding has gone the last 20
years, as soon as something becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: famous, everybody crosses it to everything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the amount of shit right now that has
cookie in it, cushion it, sour diesel in
[SPEAKER_03]: it, skittles in it, you know, you name it
in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stuff gets bread and bread,
bread, bread, bread, bread to death.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to take say cookies and to cross it
with ABC is crossing into a vastly
[SPEAKER_03]: different gene pool than anybody else is
using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so who knows what might come of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best part.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know who knows in a few years
where that might lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might lead to unique highs that might
open up the gene pool and make things pop
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not expecting genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people get on them about it because
it's so weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's really just in the infancy of
playing around with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've seen that he is, you know,
he's been posting a bunch of pictures this
[SPEAKER_03]: last week of some of his work with the
ABC.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know if you guys could
like, this is probably odd because I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been talking 98 percent of the time for an
hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear it in my throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we kind of want to just do this thing
and maybe we'll do it like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: semi often or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had this thought of kind of going
through the seed banks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's such a big subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really only touched on a little bit of
the history.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really touch on Hayes or Skunk
or Durbin or anything from Jim Ortega very
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those can be for future things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everybody enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't want to make it a
forever thing, but we could do this pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to Free Your Syndicate Patreon,
where me and Nato always shoot the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: with a bunch of people that are a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask questions all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever we have time, we go in there
and pick at them and try to break it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really true, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a server there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you can you can directly message
me on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I generally answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it takes me a minute because,
you know, I do do things and get busy or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Matt and I are both pretty active on
there and we do bullshit a bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a lot easier to ask away and get
responses on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So feel free to join that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really what all Matt and I are trying
to do at this point is just get chunks of
[SPEAKER_03]: history and chunks of knowledge out there
to the larger public.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of our weed life.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we like to do is we like to talk
about, you know, and participate on or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope everybody enjoyed it and learned
a couple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope it continues and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I think that's it.
Thank you.
