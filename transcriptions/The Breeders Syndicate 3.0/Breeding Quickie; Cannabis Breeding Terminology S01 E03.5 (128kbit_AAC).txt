[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let's kick it off, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to go over some very
basic breeding terminology, just so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can understand when we move on,
move forward, some of the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't quite gotten there yet can
understand what we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as terms go, probably one of the
more misused terms is F1, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with F1 because this is used
incorrectly in the cannabis world daily,
[SPEAKER_00]: even by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really another term to switch
it out with as we use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sadly, there's almost no F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason being is that what an F1
means is when you take two parents that
[SPEAKER_02]: are pretty much true breeding,
and you cross them together, that would
[SPEAKER_02]: result in what was called an F1,
where basically all the dominant genes
[SPEAKER_02]: from both parents will be dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'll get what's called hybrid
vigor because you're not going to get any
[SPEAKER_02]: weird recessives.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically end up with whatever the
dominant genes are in both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, an example of that,
for instance, would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: say something like, you know, for our
purposes, like skunk one by eights or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, like or or skunk one
by an NL or something, something along
[SPEAKER_02]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the reason why they use skunk one
so much was simply because it was it was
[SPEAKER_02]: an easy way to F1 something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even technically you want to get
more basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing F1s, it's like Afghani
cross to tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has to be the definition is to
the crossing two parental lines with
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctively different genotypes,
the most importantly, which makes it more
[SPEAKER_00]: rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one of the most incorrect terms
because a lot of times it's used just to
[SPEAKER_02]: say this is the first time someone's
crossed these two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my Cushman's by Skittles F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that and that and that's not right
because those aren't like parental stock
[SPEAKER_02]: from a region of origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So F2 would be if you take that F1 seed
and you grow up males and females and you
[SPEAKER_02]: cross them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when with a line, you should see
all the dominance, all the recessives,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the various permutations of what's in
that line can pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of getting like all the
dominant traits combined, you get every
[SPEAKER_02]: trait imaginable combining in every way
imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, you'll see stuff
that you would not see in the F1 line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff cannot show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that will never show up
in the F1 line that will only show up F2
[SPEAKER_02]: and F3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To give a really easy example for people
like in humans, brown eyes is a dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in order to have blue eyes,
gray eyes, green eyes, hazel eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: both parents have to have that gene and
they have to line up to two recessives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if one parent doesn't have the gene,
it'll never pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, that's F1, F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: S1 is a relatively modern thing in terms
of people being able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's basically it's a self one
either through hermaphrodism naturally or
[SPEAKER_02]: something human induced from some kind of
spray that's used in modern terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You S1 the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be sort of frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in recent years, because we have a lot
of cuts that we don't have the line
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have the specific cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be the only way to look through
genetics in that line besides,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, besides an outcross or a hybrid
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not as good as as doing because
you get a lot of weirdness when you
[SPEAKER_02]: inbreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get some undesirable things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the very least, it gives you an
idea to like look through something like
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem D or, you know, Trinity or,
you know, something that's old,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's an elite clone only.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a thing called and also
in adding on to it was looked down on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only looked down on in the cannabis
sphere in normal agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selfing is the normal way to breed uniform
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't use filial generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through self.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's so it was a cannabis kind of old
wives tale as it were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the one of the things that
happens with cannabis, too, is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in modern agriculture,
when you're developing a seed line,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might want a whole bunch of like
butter lettuce, for instance, that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: out extremely similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might want a bunch of seeds of
whatever cucumbers or zucchini or what
[SPEAKER_02]: have you that comes out extremely
dependable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they will ask one that until they
get, you know, a very dependable,
[SPEAKER_02]: very narrow breeding uniform uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's part of the reason why,
like, you know, and so IBL maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: shift this segues into it because IBL is
another like super misused terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stands essentially for inbred line.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me add this in, because this is the
point where most people lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it says inbred line, it does not
mean that if you line breed that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: an IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very specific term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a basically don't look at it
like, OK, well, I crossed this F1 made
[SPEAKER_00]: F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's linebred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically what it means is uniformity
in a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that can always be
achieved at F6 or F8.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only means when you're popping those
seeds, you have a homogenous line,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning uniform like clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, you know, for like large scale
agriculture, something like that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: useful for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that useful for the most part,
unless you get something amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: because what you see is what you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you breed with an IBL, it'll throw what
you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In hemp farms, I know that that's one
place where they're liking seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity in self lines because they just
it's more vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can pop all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they come out uniform, that's even
more that it takes the cloning out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in hemp, I can see that being more
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in modern cannabis, people want to
find that keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they want they want a little bit of
variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's new paths for a breeder,
for somebody like, you know, for a breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that getting something where,
like, there's nowhere to go within the
[SPEAKER_02]: gene pool itself, because it's an IBL and
it already is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The traits you see are the traits you get
unless you really want to add those traits
[SPEAKER_02]: to another line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, there's not a lot of room
for places to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it's already been all that
variety has been bred out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another thing with breeding,
where it's like a lot of breeding depends
[SPEAKER_02]: on what your goals are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, something depends on goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might want consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might want like the same three
to six phenos to regularly pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might want to breed an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might want to do an open
pollination or an F2 and have the widest
[SPEAKER_02]: possible gene pool to hunt through,
depending on what your what your goals
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to find like a random elite
cutting to hold on to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to actually breed a line
like Matt was saying, where you could like
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in a hemp field and start thousands
of seeds and get the same consistent,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, size bush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have IX, Incross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incross is the last one we have left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Incross is the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another weird term because in
we call it a BX.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in most other breeding, they call it a
BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: A back cross is actually like the
technical term that you would use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for for most cannabis people,
they're mostly familiar with a BX.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a BX is simply you take a cut,
you know, and you use an outside pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: donor to make a male line of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take the children of that and
you back cross it onto the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've talked about like on the previous
on the previous podcast, we talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: how, you know, you know, Neville used
Seattle Gregg's NL1 and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: would use that as a pollen donor and would
back cross to make a pure hash plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: to make a pure big bud, to make a pure
Hawaiian indica, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: J.J.
[SPEAKER_02]: from Top Dog, you know, he took an Afghani
one and used that to cross into Chem D and
[SPEAKER_02]: did that a few times and make double dog
and trace dog and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's basically what a BX is,
is you find a pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you cross it to a clone only for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you back, you keep back crossing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are kind of like the lockdown
single traits when it's back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then IX is going to be similar to a
BX, but going further down the line and
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing back to a previous generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like maybe an F6 cross to an F1 of the
same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be an in-cross because you're
crossing in between the same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it is essentially still a back
cross, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those, yeah, those things are and it's
only it's only a BX or a BC if you back
[SPEAKER_02]: cross it to the exact same parent,
exact same cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you, for instance, had like a line
of Chem D, for instance, and you and you
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed your children of that to a
different Chem D parent, it wouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_02]: BX.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to go directly back to the original
genetic stock that started the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it's not a BX.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some basic terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that covers like most people deal
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a sweet day.
Thank you.
