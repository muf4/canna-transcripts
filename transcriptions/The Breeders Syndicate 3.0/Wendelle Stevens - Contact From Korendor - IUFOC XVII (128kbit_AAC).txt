[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start the day off this
morning with one of our very favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, Wendell is going to take us on a
journey back almost 50 years to a little
[SPEAKER_00]: known case, which at the time was largely
ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with what we know now, probably
shouldn't have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather important case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us do not know much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Wendell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see so many old friends back
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little announcement to make to
start off with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always asked at these conferences,
why don't you republish that picture book?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's too expensive for us to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never did it, never intended to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one has been published, Michael
Whalen, who founded the American FIGU,
[SPEAKER_01]: got permission from Ville to redo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he redid it right from the original
slide transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pictures are much sharper here
than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any for sale here,
but there's some bookmarks on the stage
[SPEAKER_01]: here you can pick up with an address you
can contact for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my presentation today is going to be
about the Bob Renaud case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think many of you remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at my age, with a little bit of
hindsight, I can look back and see one
[SPEAKER_01]: that we popularly threw out at the time
probably shouldn't have been, because now
[SPEAKER_01]: we have all of the features of that case
have been repeated in other cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somewhat contemporary with this case
were the cases of George Adamski,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been critically criticized over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody tried to call him a charlatan
and a fraud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, nobody really investigated
that case in this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only person that really investigated
the Adamski case was Bruce Cathy from New
[SPEAKER_01]: Zealand, an airline pilot that came up
here, went to Mr. Adamski, went over all
[SPEAKER_01]: the sites, went back to the contact site,
and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his report in one of his books is the
only real report on the Adamski case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the rest of them took the cue from
the Lorenzins, from APRO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And APRO was the first world or first UFO
civilian or civilian UFO research
[SPEAKER_01]: organization in the world after NICAP,
which was not really civilian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Carl and Jim, when the newspapers
began to report the Adamski case out there
[SPEAKER_01]: in Los Angeles, Carl and Jim went to visit
George Adamski.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Carl was a beautiful lady,
but she had an acid tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was not very kind to people that
they interviewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they got to Vista, California,
he wasn't home.
[SPEAKER_01]: People at the house told him he was eating
dinner at a little diner down the road,
[SPEAKER_01]: operated by, I believe it was by his
sister or sister-in-law or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they went down there and they found
George at his table eating his breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he invited them to sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sat down across from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Carl, in her usual way to begin such
investigations, folded fingertips like
[SPEAKER_01]: this and said, George, just how the hell
did you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he immediately suspected that they're
not there to get facts, that they're there
[SPEAKER_01]: to pin him to the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said, my dear lady, you just take a
hubcap and throw it in the air and
[SPEAKER_01]: photograph it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what the Lorenzins published.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he published in the April Bulletin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being the pioneer, everybody else
copied from the April Bulletin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody investigated the case after
that until Bruce Cathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let me add a couple of comments here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in, Lou Zinstag in Basel,
Switzerland, brought me the Meyer case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd been exchanging photographs and she
heard about the case in her backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she called me one day and said,
I'm going to be coming to the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and I have some pictures I didn't
want to send to you in the mail that I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to show you if you'll pick me up at
the bus station.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, sure, I'll be glad to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you got in Tucson, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lee and Britt Elders happened to be in my
house at the time when I picked her up and
[SPEAKER_01]: brought her out to the house and she
showed us the pictures for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was through her that I made my
arrangements to go back and start my
[SPEAKER_01]: investigation of the case myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But she published the first UFO journal in
the world in German out of Basel,
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was the niece of Carl Jung.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was an international journalist,
spoke, read, and wrote in five languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she contacted George Adamski early on
from the newspaper reports and began a
[SPEAKER_01]: correspondence with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he was invited to come to Europe
to meet the king and queen of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands, and Pope John the 23rd,
he went first to Lou Zinstag's home in
[SPEAKER_01]: Basel and she escorted him all around
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that he made the trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that he was welcomed when he
got to the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that he did get to the Vatican.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was in the taxi when he left to go
into the Vatican.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was waiting for him when he came
out and had the Papal medal, which they
[SPEAKER_01]: took back to Basel and put it in Lou
Zinstag's brother's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He owned a jewelry store there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I know is all true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that he could have faked
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others similar to that were Kelvin Rowe,
Orfeo Angelucci, Violet Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to tell you about Violet Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a contactee in Santa Barbara,
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her visitors agreed one time to let
her photograph their ships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she told a photography friend that
owned a photo processing shop at a studio
[SPEAKER_01]: in Santa Barbara what was going to happen
and what was the best film to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, oh, by all means,
we should get Coat of Color because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the sharpest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she invited him to go with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she took her handheld 35 millimeter
camera and an 8 millimeter movie camera
[SPEAKER_01]: and rolled the film.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he took a 4 by 5 press camera with
him, took pictures with that also.
[SPEAKER_01]: The visitors appeared on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took pictures of it flying overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took pictures of it making an
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took pictures of it landing and
occupants getting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the contact only lasted about a half
an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they quickly snapped a lot of
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shot almost all of their film.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after this event, they rushed right
back to the studio to turn in their film
[SPEAKER_01]: for processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both went to a Five Points drugstore
that had a film processing center there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they turned their film in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, you had to wait about
two weeks for it to be processed and sent
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they don't process Coat of Color
except in licensed processing
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was only five.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, there was four in the United
States and one in Hong Kong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the Coat of Color film had to go to
one of the licensed processing
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they went back to pick their film
up two weeks later on schedule,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got a You Goof slip in the envelope
instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The slip says you may have had taken your
pictures with the lens on the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might have had your thumb over the lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pictures didn't come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were entitled to a free roll of
film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it to your nearest supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them got the You Goof slips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's a little unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one man was an expert photographer
for him to leave the lens on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, he was using it through the lens
camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he couldn't see anything if the
lens cap was on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I heard about this, I was visiting
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Guilt Violet was telling me what
happened to the film.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, why don't you send them
to take them to a Kodak shop or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she took hers to a Kodak shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent his up through his own shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, they both got You Goof slips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's telling me this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, I've got one roll of
35-millimeter film left.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you can get it processed,
I'll give it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah, I can get it processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me have it, and I'll see what I can
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that time, I was in touch with Bob
Beck, Robert Beck, who was the head of
[SPEAKER_01]: color control, processing Kodakolor film
for the film studios out in Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, yes, I can get it developed
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'm only going to let you leave it
with you if you can guarantee me that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can return the roll of film processed or
the roll of film unprocessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, I've got to have the
original film back, processed or
[SPEAKER_01]: unprocessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I can do it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, come back in about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I left, and I got a call from him two
days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, come down to the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went down to see Bob, and he had the
roll of film on his desk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, Mr. Stevens, I can't guarantee
you that I can return this film if we
[SPEAKER_01]: process it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I wasn't aware of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he says, my lab chief says that we are
governed by a classified government
[SPEAKER_01]: directive that regulates all Kodakolor
licensed processing agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there's only five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to report certain things
seen on film.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, what you describe on here is
one of the subjects that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: report.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll send somebody to take a look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may not get it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, don't process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it back to the owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happened to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that was a good case.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got a lot of good pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't get much publicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a remarkable case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there would have been some marvelous
evidence if we could have gotten it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one that was contemporary with
George was the Mitchell sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you remember, George Zdamsky said
his contacts were with Venusians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Mitchell sisters said their
contacts were with Martians.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the Mitchell sisters' case,
they had Venusians aboard the Martian
[SPEAKER_01]: spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the Violet Gilbert case,
they mentioned Martians working with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another case, Halsey,
Lieutenant Commander Halsey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think his name was, his uncle was Bull
Halsey, who he said also had contacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this Lieutenant Commander Halsey was
on patrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the war, when we had cut
back in money and we couldn't return
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody at one time, the peachy boat
commanders were given grids in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: to run to patrol until they could be
returned and retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Halsey, young Commander Halsey,
was running his grid with his patrol boat
[SPEAKER_01]: when it ran onto solid ground in open
ocean and was lifted up in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never saw this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not on a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He jumped overboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he jumped down onto a solid object.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kept rising, and his PT boat is high
and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a conning tower came up out of the
hard surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: The door opened, and the man stepped out,
took him aboard, and showed him around and
[SPEAKER_01]: told him that they had been observing him
for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew him by his first name,
told him that they showed him around then.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they let him go, they told him that
the time was up and that they would see
[SPEAKER_01]: him again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came back several times while he was
still patrolling in the Pacific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he returned home to California,
told his wife about what was happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: she said, well, I'd like to meet him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next time he was summoned for a
contact, he told them about his wife's
[SPEAKER_01]: desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We consider you a unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring her along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then him and his wife would meet them
at rendezvous points that would be sent to
[SPEAKER_01]: them through the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd receive a letter with a rendezvous
point at a certain place and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they'd go there, the Venusians,
they said they were, met them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the Venusians came with a
Martian.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time they came with a Martian couple,
and they all had dinner in a restaurant
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is a little difficult to accept.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at Venus, we see a hot
surface, 800 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 atmospheres of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing could live there as we understand
it in our physical sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we have to remember that when we look
out, we're looking out through physical
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes with physical senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the instrumentation we build is to
simply extend or augment our physical
[SPEAKER_01]: senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Venusians explain that their life wave
does not vibrate to the same frequency as
[SPEAKER_01]: ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the life wave is a little bit finer
in density of vibration or density of
[SPEAKER_01]: frequencies at something equivalent to our
lower astral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they come here, they have to slow
down their vibrations to interact with us
[SPEAKER_01]: physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we can't speed up our vibrations,
they interact with them in their reality,
[SPEAKER_01]: their astral reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't perceive them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean they're not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, and there are a lot of visitors
from the Venus life wave come to this
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that their life wave exists in a
vibrational level above the physical level
[SPEAKER_01]: that we see when we look at Venus and
someplace in the clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they have trees and plants and
rivers and flowers, mountains and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that we have, but in their
density of reality, appropriate to their
[SPEAKER_01]: density of reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a number of cases of visitors
from Venus describing such conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are unable to test them because we
just can't see into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the Venusians offered a reverse
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, if somebody else looking at the
Earth, whose site was denser than the
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth's site, and looked at your planet
and saw only the top of the molten lava
[SPEAKER_01]: layer under the basaltic crust,
he would think that was your surface of
[SPEAKER_01]: your planet because the rest is
transparent to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that would be a reverse
situation between Earth and Venus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have getting up to the contract
we want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they came from another
planet also, and that they had to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: change to remain here comfortably and in a
physical sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these others, by the way, were
successfully put down by the UFO clubs,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are really their own worst enemies.
[SPEAKER_01]: For lack of money and resource,
for proper investigation, they never could
[SPEAKER_01]: go anyplace and do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had member subscribers that barely
paid for the publication, but they never
[SPEAKER_01]: could afford to send anybody anywhere to
stay a week or two in another country or
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere and do any kind of
investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a club couldn't own you, they attacked
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they did own you, others did the
attacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the situation with the case we
want to talk about involving Bob Renaud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went back through the contact cases
that I'm familiar with, and I made a list
[SPEAKER_01]: of things in common with other UFO cases,
and this seems to be, we seem to have
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much a general application here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all, the ones that interact with us
that we are concerned about, are human in
[SPEAKER_01]: appearance just like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we see them, they look like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just a little bit different in
morphology, ears a different shape,
[SPEAKER_01]: lips a different shape, eyes a different
shape, color a little different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're human placental animals like
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always using a variety of
different ships.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't come in just one type.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cases, there is more than one type
making the approach and the contact,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this seems to be a norm also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them speak our languages fluently,
and before they can interact with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, they have to learn the
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means a period of observation
before the contact is ever made,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're not aware of that until the
contact is made.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that time, they know quite a bit about
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also make careful observations of
Earth affairs, Earth concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use marvelous technologies like
ultralight speeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can read thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use our radio and television
communications at will.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use all of our communications,
including telegraph and computers as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have examples of other forms of
communication used.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, back to the Adamski case,
he was told to go to that diner near
[SPEAKER_01]: Blythe by his friends and a contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: About the same time, George Hunt
Williamson got word from his sources to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the same diner south of Blythe,
and a railroad telegraph operator from a
[SPEAKER_01]: little town outside of Prescott received
over the railroad telegraph, where his
[SPEAKER_01]: contacts had been coming over the railroad
telegraph regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He recognized the source.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a practice with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was their way of communication,
and they sent him and his wife to the same
[SPEAKER_01]: diner south of Blythe, and Adamski and
George Hunt Williamson and his wife and Al
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey and his wife all met at the diner
and decided that since they've all been
[SPEAKER_01]: sent there by their sources, certainly
nothing is going to happen on the highway
[SPEAKER_01]: in front of the diner, so they got in
their cars and got to drive up to a remote
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The women had packed lunch and they were
going to go up out of town and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: picnic, and they chose a road north
towards the mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went up their little ways and stopped
for the picnic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the rest of the story,
the George Adamski story.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, the reason he had the water
and plaster of Paris in his car is his
[SPEAKER_01]: contacts told him to take the water and
plaster of Paris before he left to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the diner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that like to dismiss the Adamski
case, Fred Steckling has a table in here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and his father was the one that interacted
regularly and frequently with George
[SPEAKER_01]: Adamski.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get more information from him,
but I have to wonder if the George Adamski
[SPEAKER_01]: case is such a patent fraud, why did the
United States government send a government
[SPEAKER_01]: airplane to pick him up at Miramar every
time he had a substantive contact and fly
[SPEAKER_01]: him to the Pentagon for debriefings and
then fly him back to Miramar in a military
[SPEAKER_01]: airplane?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they didn't think he was a
fraud, and they often invited him to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Pentagon in the Pentagon guest
facilities overnight, which he always
[SPEAKER_01]: refused to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would leave the Pentagon, take the
ferry across the Potomac, and go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rotifer's home across the river from the
Pentagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always stayed there because he didn't
know what might happen if he stayed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pentagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most of the visitors use tractor or
levitation beams.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pick their subjects up, equipment
also, in a beam of light that lifts it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can move it and place it wherever
they want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them that I've encountered have
had any money system like ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their system is entirely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't carry cash and they don't have
bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them have no religions like ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them have intrusive observational
technologies and can look in on anything
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them had underground and
underwater bases, and what I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about does have both here on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them limited their direct contact
with humans to a very few selected
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals, and they didn't allow it to
be broadened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you why, or one reason that may
be why.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was investigating the Pleiades
case, of course, I always wanted to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: the Pleiades, like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Billy Meyer had his close friend Guido
Moosbrüger his wife and a couple others
[SPEAKER_01]: that he wanted to take into the case with
him to meet Semyasi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, he resorted to a little trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put one of them under a poncho on the
back of his moped when he was going to a
[SPEAKER_01]: rendezvous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was on a night in January,
in the middle of the night at two o'clock
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's cold as heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the forest, on the way to the
rendezvous site, they told him to stop and
[SPEAKER_01]: let the passenger off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't welcome, or they would leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he put the woman off in the snow with
no cold wind or gear and went to meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: rendezvous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he'd be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in the warm ship with Semyasi,
and he says, aren't you sorry for that
[SPEAKER_01]: poor woman back there in the cold?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Semyasi said, we told you not to bring
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I don't understand this at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I bring somebody in?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's so secret about all this?
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, no big thing, and it's no big
secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, the problem comes when the
second person enters the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, everybody doesn't have the same
concepts, doesn't have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: background.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different background,
different languages, different educational
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, different understandings of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, they don't all see
everything the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says, five witnesses to an automobile
accident, they always describe it in their
[SPEAKER_01]: details.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're disparaging between the details
when they go to make comparisons later.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, the problem comes when the
second, third, and other people enter the
[SPEAKER_01]: case because they won't see it exactly the
same way you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in time, they begin to group up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will agree, and others don't agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then more agree, and then they have
more factions.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says, look at your Christian
religions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have 220 different factions,
each one believing he has the true source.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says, this is what happens when you
expand the context.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, it's more economical to us to
simply stop the context with you and start
[SPEAKER_01]: with somebody else that does not have
these needs in order to work productively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after that, I stopped trying to get
into context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, everybody else did,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we knew why it's not going to
happen and maybe never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that reason, all contacts were limited
to single contactees.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, I don't know of any case
except for the husband and wife team where
[SPEAKER_01]: more than one contactee was admitted into
the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them spoke of an organization of
planets of some kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of the Solar Cross Brothers,
channeled by the young guy, what was his
[SPEAKER_01]: name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Miller, Dick Miller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they spoke of an organization of
planets that they were a member of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it included a lot of the local planets
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Corinthians, speaking to Bob Renaud,
described two major organizations that
[SPEAKER_01]: have operations in our sector of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not include the Solar Cross
Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had an alliance of planets and a
confederation of planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're roughly equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go into that a little bit more
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there does seem to be a system of
organization beyond Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the visitors have bases on our
moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the Corinthians did,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of them mentioned Mars and Venus
beings visiting Earth, and so do the
[SPEAKER_01]: Corinthians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other witnesses involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the first information, if I can find
the pointer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we'll bring up a slide here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I just covered, that
information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's readable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first publication that put out
anything on the Bob Renaud case.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the UFO International,
put out by AFSCA, Amalgamated Flying
[SPEAKER_01]: Saucers Company, put out by Gabriel Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gabriel Green was a young man that
inherited the family fortune and took it
[SPEAKER_01]: to organize a UFO research group and
started publishing a little magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of his early issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there were several issues before
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you see here is a picture on the
cover done by a staff artist of a
[SPEAKER_01]: Corinthian vehicle that was manufactured
on Corandora and transported here by a
[SPEAKER_01]: telemetric program.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next one is a succeeding issue of the
AFSCA Journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also UFO International is what it was
titled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had some more of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is Gabriel Green, the publisher of
that journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a pretty good, well-going
organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went to the Giant Rock Convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still a few old folks here that
remember the convention of the Giant Rock
[SPEAKER_01]: in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may even remember Gabriel Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one time, the Independent Party in the
United States ran him as a candidate for
[SPEAKER_01]: president.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll go into that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is the report that I summarized from
the work done by Gabriel Green back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what the cover that I worked
out for the book that I am putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, the book is only in e-book
format.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't afford to publish a hard copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the back cover of the book looks
something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it looks like we've lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back cover of the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is actually lost the back cover,
but that's a diagram of the ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me see if I can find a pointer
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left-hand side, you see a little
craft aboard, a little disk-shaped craft
[SPEAKER_01]: with a dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the smaller scouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only carries one or two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's carried aboard this other larger
scout, also a shuttle craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob Renaud was eventually shown how to
operate this little craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: It operates very simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was shown how to operate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of times, they sent a craft
to pick him up in the driveway in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: his house with nobody else aboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The canopy would go up all by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a voice would invite him aboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would fly him out to the shuttle
craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Bob Renaud appeared one time on the
platform describing his case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was at Buck Nelson's program back
in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Mountain View, Wisconsin,
about 1967.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we got one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was attacked by the debunkers and
ridiculed for telling his story because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was one of the earlier stories of ongoing
contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he decided that his problem in trying
to answer the question is nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to a substantive answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ask a one-line question and want a
one-line answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often get those in the Swiss case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he decided that he didn't have time
to educate the closed minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't have any particular interest
in it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew his truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had his own facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't feel any need to persuade
anybody else to believe what he already
[SPEAKER_01]: knew himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he refused to go on the platform
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stopped sending his reports to Gabriel
Green and just kept them all to himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contacts continued.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Karl and Annie Weit in Wiesbaden,
Germany, an organization they called
[SPEAKER_01]: Deuist, published the UFO Nachrichten,
which is UFO news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only UFO newspaper in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 18 pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had nothing but UFO news and
reports around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they soon heard about Bob Renaud's
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they invited him to come to Germany
and tell them about it and send him a
[SPEAKER_01]: ticket, a prepaid ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took his notes and went to Wiesbaden
and met Karl and Annie Weit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talked about his case for several
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Weits became so interested,
they wanted to publish his information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he finally agreed to let them publish
it only if they wouldn't allow it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: translated into English and sent back to
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Weits published the notes that he
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took three volumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's volume one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's volume two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a picture of one of the
shuttlecraft on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's volume three.
[SPEAKER_01]: The slides are out of order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like that's volume one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there were three volumes that were
published by UFO Nachrichten.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it included, in those volumes,
they included the only pictures that were
[SPEAKER_01]: ever released of Bob Renaud's facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Renaud was a high school graduate
about 19 years old, turned 20 while this
[SPEAKER_01]: was early going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He rented a basement room in his parents'
home and worked in a general electric
[SPEAKER_01]: factory in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he took his money that he earned in
his job and collected electronic
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: He became a ham radio buff, built his own
ham radio set from a kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he proceeded to build himself a
home-built television set from a kit also.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the television set in the left
side of the picture there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his ham radio is in the front on the
little table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was happy with his communications
gear and his setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was serving him well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was being fulfilled by the efforts
that he was putting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was there, sitting there reading a
magazine one night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he thought he'd tune in the BBC News
broadcast from London.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he put his magazine down and went over
and turned his set on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it warm up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then tried to tune in BBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the closer he got to BBC, the louder
noise he got in his radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a beep, beep, beep, beep that was
quite loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he got on BBC, it was so loud he
couldn't really hear BBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he tuned down to get away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't hear very good that way either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he tuned back up again and went looking
for the beep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he homed on the beep and got it loud
and clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a soft voice said, Bob, stay on this
frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been trying to contact you for some
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was amazed that this was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stayed on the frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they told him that if he would make
some adjustments in his shortwave radio,
[SPEAKER_01]: he could signal them and they could come
back to him immediately on a better
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency, a clearer frequency,
which they set up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made the modifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he had regular contact between him
and the visitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after four or five of these contacts,
they told him how to modify his home-built
[SPEAKER_01]: television set to do the same thing so he
could pick up images on his television set
[SPEAKER_01]: of them transmitted from their craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he had two-way communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could sit in front of his television
set, a round black and white screen there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could come on his radio and see them at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he thought this was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those contacts continued to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they told him that they would
eventually talk to him face to face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the only time that he appeared on a
convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another picture of him in his
little basement studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a picture of Buck Nelson's
convention from a book where I found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Buck Nelson in the left side walking
into the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a very impressive convention,
but it still attracted a few people,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it attracted the debunkers right along
with all the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another issue of Gabriel Green's
UFO International.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's calling it Flying Saucers
International.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this picture shows the Corinthian car
where they picked the Bob Bernoud up in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they flew to an area not more than
eight miles from where he lives in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Berkshire Mountains, descended into a
forest clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they got a few yards above the
ground, it opened up like you see there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clamshell doors opened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The car went down a shaft.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doors closed behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were in an elaborately excavated
underground facility that the car traveled
[SPEAKER_01]: down the corridors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrying the passengers with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they traveled some distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite a large facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went down several corridors and
parked the car in a parking garage and got
[SPEAKER_01]: on escalator walks, sidewalks,
moving sidewalks down some more corridors
[SPEAKER_01]: to a welcoming room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there his friends presented Bob to
somebody at a reception desk, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared a package of plastic pass for him
to be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plastic pass that had some coded signals
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they gave him this pass so he could
use it to get into the facility by himself
[SPEAKER_01]: if he ever needed to or was told to or
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next issue of the Flying Saucers
International showed the first man to walk
[SPEAKER_01]: in space.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy walked in space on a Corinthian
craft in a Corinthian space suit eight
[SPEAKER_01]: months before our first American astronaut
made an extravehicular exit from our
[SPEAKER_01]: spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we give a lot of credit to our first
man to walk in space, but he's really not
[SPEAKER_01]: the first one to be out there outside the
craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Bob Renaut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is a little more detail on the space
suit that they provided him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not a highly pressurized suit,
but it contained an atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_01]: his Earth atmosphere in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had control buttons on the breast
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had magnetic boots that stuck to the
surface of the spacecraft they were in.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he tilted his ankle at a certain
angle, it would release the magnetism and
[SPEAKER_01]: he could lift the boot.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he put it down again, it would stay
fast until he tipped his ankle a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a diagram there of the
spacecraft, the inside of the spacecraft,
[SPEAKER_01]: that took him out into space for that walk
in space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll come back to that diagram a
little later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That particular spacecraft, I believe,
was about 60 feet in diameter,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we get another diagram of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next one shows as an artist's
rendition of Bob Renaut's departure from
[SPEAKER_01]: his driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that little remote-controlled dome
disk that carries only one or two people
[SPEAKER_01]: that I showed you aboard another craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it's approaching the carrier craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see the iris port that opened as
it got closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went in that iris port inside,
into the hangar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob got out and met his friends there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is a photograph of the area where
they parked the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the first time, for the first
face-to-face meeting, he got his signal on
[SPEAKER_01]: his ham radio, told him to be out in front
of his house at 4 o'clock sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went out there about five minutes
early and almost right on the dot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Headlights came around the corner in the
distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was dark at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a cold morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a Plymouth convertible turned the
corner with one man in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He pulled up, stopped, and opened the door
to let Bob in.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he got in the convertible,
he saw that it was a man that he worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with in the General Electric plant in the
town near his home there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this man had attempted to engage Bob
in discussions of UFOs several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob wasn't really interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he'd sit and listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't pay much attention to the
guy until now he's driving the car at the
[SPEAKER_01]: rendezvous time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got in the car with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he drove out of town and into a wooded
area where they came on this other car
[SPEAKER_01]: that was apported here from Corundor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They parked the Plymouth in the trees
right back out of sight there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got in the Corindian car and went to the
underground base for the first visit at
[SPEAKER_01]: the underground base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another pick-up point.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time he was picked up and taken to
this place in the Corindian car.
[SPEAKER_01]: They left the Corindian car and got into a
larger craft and went elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a diagram of the 60-foot diameter
spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are unmanned spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are unmanned disks here that are
used for remote control observation aboard
[SPEAKER_01]: the craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this little disk here are more remote
monitors like these that they launch and
[SPEAKER_01]: control from the control panel inside
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do all kinds of surveillance and
observational work with these monitor
[SPEAKER_01]: disks that are very sophisticated,
can do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a diagram of a larger craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: This craft is 155 feet in diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we see some bigger disks that are
about the size of the other disk we just
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at that carry monitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger disks are launched and
recovered from this 150-foot diameter disk
[SPEAKER_01]: craft, disk-shaped craft, that carried a
crew of about 60 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I borrowed that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's all kinds of facilities here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The latrine facilities, the dining
facilities, everything's all illustrated
[SPEAKER_01]: in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in the book that I've published
in e-book format.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you see here is published in
e-book format.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can bring it up on your screen,
make it as big as you want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: read the letters as large as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shape of its construction there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next one is a much bigger craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: This craft, I believe, is on the order of
250.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sphere about 250 feet in diameter,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get back here to my
[SPEAKER_01]: notes, see if I can find the details I had
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to give you the,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I should have been turning these
carefully as I went.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I believe I'm getting back to
where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the 155, before that was the
155-foot diameter disk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are, the 400-foot diameter
alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craft SPC-12 is what they called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob was given printed guidebooks for this
ship so he could tell where he was and
[SPEAKER_01]: find his way around, which he was allowed
to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guidebooks were printed in Corinthian,
but by now they have taught him to read
[SPEAKER_01]: Corinthian script.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found that when he was in the
underground base in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: that all the signs in the underground base
were lettered in English and he asked,
[SPEAKER_01]: or eval, his escort, why the English
signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, well, we're in an
English-speaking country and all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: employees here, all of the people that
work here, are trained in English and they
[SPEAKER_01]: go out and come back and they need to know
the language.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is just to keep it all
current.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they learned our languages
a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took them like two weeks to learn the
first language and they chose English
[SPEAKER_01]: because that seemed to be spoken more
prominently in what appeared to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: country with the most advanced technical
information available.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost the slide again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That machine back there is not doing too
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a picture of or eval's space car
on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lost part of it in the screen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the garments that they wear in
the underground base facility and also in
[SPEAKER_01]: the disk-shaped craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they come to visit, they're
earth-style garments, but this is not what
[SPEAKER_01]: they wear when they come out and mix in
society.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wear clothes that they bought in
clothing stores just like we wear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a comfortable kind of a
uniform that they wear in their Corinthian
[SPEAKER_01]: base facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a man and here's a woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a diagram of the Alliance of
Planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of papers up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to keep shuffling just to keep
up with where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: A diagram of the Alliance of Planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top division there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Alliance was formed with 150 planets
joined in a dream that had been
[SPEAKER_01]: flourishing for centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name has long since been called the
United Worlds Alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the great visions of our founders are
as fresh today as they were in that
[SPEAKER_01]: hallowed place where they were formed 650
years ago in your time, which has become a
[SPEAKER_01]: shrine that every Alliance citizen tries
to visit at least once in his lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier, I stated this is a Corinthian
addressing Bob Renaud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier, I stated that the present count
of the Alliance Worlds was about 740,000,
[SPEAKER_01]: although that is the full number of the
UAWs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now split into five major divisions
of which Corandors has about 143,000
[SPEAKER_01]: planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of 143,000 planets in its
division of the Alliance of Planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: This segmenting was made necessary by the
sheer enormity of the task of attempting
[SPEAKER_01]: to govern so many worlds under one roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process of partitioning took place
over a period of four years, and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: ended about September 19th of 1986 of your
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The system of government that I will now
outline came out of that conclave carried
[SPEAKER_01]: out of this mammoth operation at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Council of Elders, the top line on the
chart there, the Council of Elders is
[SPEAKER_01]: still the official ruling body of the full
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is not ruled by edict.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ruled by recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Council deliberates on problems and
makes recommendations, and they either
[SPEAKER_01]: follow it or they don't, but they usually
follow it because that's usually the best
[SPEAKER_01]: course of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Council is made up of the wisest men
in their society, and each unit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Alliance of the society picks the wisest
men they have to participate in the levels
[SPEAKER_01]: going up to the senior Councils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a kind of a government, but it's not
elective, and it's not addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't issue mandates.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are five sub-Councils that handle
the matters within their respective
[SPEAKER_01]: divisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In turn, these are subdivided into sector
Councils that each control about 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: planets in a specific region of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are again segmented into
sub-sectors, the lowest level of the
[SPEAKER_01]: official Alliance hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of them handles the affairs of about
100 worlds in close spatial proximity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This basic diagram illustrates the new
format.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was adopted in 1988.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Council of Masters up there has
five divisions of 143,000 each,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sub-Council down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Masters also has five sub-Councils
within their divisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sector Council has about 10,000
planets in each specific sector,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those are subdivided into groups of
100 worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Masters that we're talking about are
the wisest people that they have in their
[SPEAKER_01]: society.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spiritual people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They achieve Mastership by knowing more
than anybody else, and because they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: telepathic, this is easily recognized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a recommendation is made by a
senior Master, it usually is followed
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's the best course of action
that could be decided anyway, and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get the best result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now where is, exactly where is
Corridor?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Arcturus, and about two finger
widths northeast of Arcturus, as you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it in the night sky, right in there
someplace, head zero, is a star that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can just barely see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the finest magnitude on the star
charts, it's just a tiny little dot,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's their sun, Corrina.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even number it on our charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their sun has several planets,
they come, the Corindians come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: third planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go into that a little bit more
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's the star chart from the big
star chart, astronomical star chart used
[SPEAKER_01]: by astronomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing we have here,
it's probably going to be difficult for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to read, is a list of Corindian
scientists that have been working in one
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship or another with Bob Renaud,
he's met them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they represent, for instance,
just to give you some idea, Vern Farrow,
[SPEAKER_01]: the top one, works in anthropodynamics,
the other two do also.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Mellar, the fourth one down,
works in chemistry, and the next one does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry Saul, the electronics engineer,
helped Bob Renaud do some modifications on
[SPEAKER_01]: his equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vero Palin, under that, is a genetical
biologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ali Sauron, after that, is a genetical
biologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sen Khor is a linguist.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can learn languages in about two
weeks, any language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ori Vall is a mathematician.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the principal contact with Bob
Renaud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ori Vall is the one that picked him up and
escorted him around the various facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: they took him to see, but he was a
mathematician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lynn Airy, down in the lower middle,
is a psychologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was the first voice that contacted him
over the radio, and he maintained a
[SPEAKER_01]: constant contact with Lynn Airy whenever
he was being escorted around the Corindian
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: She accompanied Ori Vall, and together
they showed him around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They introduced him to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They demonstrated things for him in their
Corindian society and their base
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Below the break in the names there is Han
Kim, a sociologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: The four below him are also sociologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Below them, the last four names,
Airy Lon is a teratologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other four are teratologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teratologists are scientists that study
Earth, particular studies of Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next chart, which you probably can't
read either, is a crew of the SBC-12,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the big 400-foot diameter sphere
that he was shown about, given a manual
[SPEAKER_01]: guide in Corindian language, how to get
around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let him keep the guide, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: He still has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crew was made up of the top one is an
analyst, Eshtabari.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the captain, Lani Eldron.
[SPEAKER_01]: He met him several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the co-captain.
[SPEAKER_01]: He only met once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Communications officer Ken Roy helped him
do some work on his gear also.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were console operators, three of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three engineers, a flight engineer,
more mathematicians, and an astrological
[SPEAKER_01]: officer, a navigator.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last group is masters in the
governmental hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The masters that he met at one time or
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: The uppercase letters are the elder
masters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lowercase letters are just masters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The elder masters are elected by the
conclave of masters because they rise to a
[SPEAKER_01]: level of superior knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are not very many of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you an idea of what the masters
are, and what they do, they all have
[SPEAKER_01]: specializations also.
[SPEAKER_01]: That first one on the top there is Kren
Lor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from Arcturia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arcturia is a headquarters planet for the
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many records are kept there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he frequently met Kren Lor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Akhen Vestra was from Corindor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Akhen Vestra from Corindor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corindor had primary responsibility for
the Earth operations going on here by the
[SPEAKER_01]: Corindians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there was more from Corindia and
Corindor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here's the last group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our miscellaneous personality met along
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to characterize them a little
bit, there was the first one, Arta Doric,
[SPEAKER_01]: was a replacement for, oh, this is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arta Doric, a time came when they wanted
to take Bob to view something that was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take more than one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means he's gonna have to get a
vacation from his job or maybe lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: His parents, he's carefully kept his
contacts from his parents because he knew
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would be highly disturbed that
they knew what he was doing between the
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of midnight and morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he never told them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a pet dog that slept on his bed,
put it in his bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't have time to tell his
employers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that pick up, the Corindians
brought another man with them and
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced him to Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looked just like Bob, like a twin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, this is Arta Doric.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will replace you while we're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been carefully prepared to use your
habits and mannerisms, speak with your
[SPEAKER_01]: voice, and work your job at General
Electric Plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody will know the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they left Arta Doric.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was dressed in the same kind of clothes
that Bob was wearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went into the house, into Bob's
basement room, and went to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob went with Orval and the rest of the
team on the mission they were taking him
[SPEAKER_01]: on at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any other particular names of
interest there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There in Sen was a Venusian working with
the Corindians that they had picked up who
[SPEAKER_01]: was from a Venusian mission on the moon
that was observing Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they showed Bob their language and
gave him a language course when he learned
[SPEAKER_01]: to speak and read Corindian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got some symbols here to show
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what the Corindian language looked
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are punctuation symbols.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third column over right about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are Corindian punctuation marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their equivalents are shown out here
in this column.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one, for example, is a period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second one is a comma.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third one is a hyphen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth one is a colon, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had a very well developed
language system, as well developed as
[SPEAKER_01]: English or any of the other Earth
languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some instances, it was even more
developed and conveyed more knowledge in
[SPEAKER_01]: the words than we know and use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another page on the Corindian
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this, by the way, is in the little
mini CD where you can bring them up and
[SPEAKER_01]: look at them in great detail later if
you're interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: These show a sentence right here written
in Corindian language, which says,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a phrase that was frequently used as
they were departing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd say, va ilus inusol noi unir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that meant, go in the light and until
next we meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this shows Corindian symbols.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are Galinguin symbols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the Corindian linguists explained that
in the alliance of worlds, hundreds,
[SPEAKER_01]: even thousands of worlds in the alliance,
in this particular sector of space,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are two major interplanetary
languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is Galinguin, and the other is,
oh boy, I forgot it, Galinguin and Solix
[SPEAKER_01]: Mal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solix Mal was the language system that was
described by George Hunt Williamson in his
[SPEAKER_01]: book, Other Tongues, Other Flesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never mentioned anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he did mention Galinguin in his book,
too, but he didn't explain anything on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Corindians explained that the
Corindian language was derived from
[SPEAKER_01]: Galinguin and that in the foundation of
languages that these two major language
[SPEAKER_01]: systems have many derivatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like on Earth, many languages are
derived from Latin.
[SPEAKER_01]: One might say that Latin was a base
language for Earth languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that same sense, Galinguin was a
base language for many planetary languages
[SPEAKER_01]: within the alliance of planet systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Solix Mal was the basic language of
another federation of planet systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, incidentally, was a parallel group
parallel to the alliance of planets that
[SPEAKER_01]: had roughly the same number of planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're intermixed with the alliance
planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're allied in what they call the
alliance of planets and the, slip my mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: alliance and planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Confederation of planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The confederation of planets is something
like the alliance of planets that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: same kind of a governing system and
similar, but the confederation of planets
[SPEAKER_01]: uses another base language system than
Galinguin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything on that here,
but those two are present all over our
[SPEAKER_01]: neighboring, our sector of the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Galinguin the other one and Solix Mal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when I was studying the languages
there, I should have had that up while I
[SPEAKER_01]: was talking about it, here is,
while I was doing this, I discovered
[SPEAKER_01]: another book that was written about Bob
Renaud, apart from what Gabriel Green was
[SPEAKER_01]: publishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a book that was written by
John Dean, who wrote, he was pretty well
[SPEAKER_01]: known for his authorship of Flying Saucers
and the Scriptures, a book that he had
[SPEAKER_01]: written before this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And John W.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dean, hearing of Bob's Renaud's contacts,
made direct contact with him and began a
[SPEAKER_01]: long correspondence with Bob about the
contacts with the Corinthians and their
[SPEAKER_01]: intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was welcomed by Bob as one of the few
with whom serious interest, with serious
[SPEAKER_01]: interest and intentions about his
spectacular case and a regular and
[SPEAKER_01]: frequent communication developed between
Bob and John Dean.
[SPEAKER_01]: John asked many questions, got many
answers, including a description of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Corinthians language and a table of other
stars with planets in our vicinity of our
[SPEAKER_01]: Milky Way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This part we will share some of the
profound information revealed to Bob
[SPEAKER_01]: Renaud for John Dean at John Dean's
request by the Corinthians themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: as originally published in John Dean's
book, Flying Saucers Close-Up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here is that book, for those of you
that have a copy of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see the title on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why we don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should have had Flying Saucers
Close-Up by John W.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That little picture was in the middle of
the page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is amazing because the slide was
photographed from this page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see we lost all the writing on the
slide and tell me how that could be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gremlins, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So John Dean
[SPEAKER_01]: asked a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very interested in details that
Gabriel Green didn't get.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, about the first moon trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bob had pretty much terminated his
furnishing of information to Gabriel Green
[SPEAKER_01]: by the time he took the first trip to the
moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a scene painted by a staff
artist for the Flying Saucers Close-Up
[SPEAKER_01]: book, the cover I tried to show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this shows Bob Renaud and a woman from
the control center on the moon,
[SPEAKER_01]: Astralory, riding moon scooters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice they're wheelless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in a low-pressure suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: For traveling around on the surface of the
moon, it shows the earth there painted
[SPEAKER_01]: into the scene in its proper perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here now, then, is the book,
Flying Saucers and the Scriptures,
[SPEAKER_01]: published by John Dean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may even have that book in
your collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a very big book, but it was a
discussion of the biblical reports of
[SPEAKER_01]: contacts with extraterrestrial beings and
an analysis of them and an attempt to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain them by John Dean before these
contacts began.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now John Dean, asking about the
relationship with the language,
[SPEAKER_01]: was the one that persuaded Bob to get the
description of the language and the
[SPEAKER_01]: language presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot more to it, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just those three pages only showed the
punctuation and a phrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he got a system of description of the
language and vocabulary of words also and
[SPEAKER_01]: how to make phrases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not satisfied with that much,
John Dean started pressuring Bob Renaud to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a list of the inhabited planets in our
near space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bob asked the Corinthians what they
could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said they would get their scientists,
their astronomers, to prepare such a list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And John Dean was writing his book that
you just saw, Flying Saucers Close-Up,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a large section on Bob Renaud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the publisher was pushing him now to
get the rest of his information in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he still had not received the list of
planets that he'd asked for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was delaying the printing until he
could get the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was pushing Bob to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob was trying to hustle the Corinthians
to get the list to John Dean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave them John Dean's address.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the Corinthians prepared the list
to transmit it, instead of delivering it
[SPEAKER_01]: to Bob to be delivered to John Dean,
they were trying to speed it up by sending
[SPEAKER_01]: an emissary from the Earth base in
Massachusetts with the list to go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: mail it to John Dean directly,
which they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the package arrived.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Dean looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought, gee, this is just what I
looked for, what I asked for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll send it right off to the
publisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time to do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what went to the publisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the list included and this is the
beginning of that chapter on the other
[SPEAKER_01]: planets in John Dean's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll read the prelude here because
it's kind of important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list will include those planets among
the 75 brightest stars known to Earth's
[SPEAKER_01]: astronomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The listings will be as follows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stars astronomical designation as used
by astronomers, such as gamma booties,
[SPEAKER_01]: its common name, is used by the alliance
in this chart, which is nearly always the
[SPEAKER_01]: word used by the inhabitants, if any,
of its planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its alliance register number, its distance
from us in light years, from Earth in
[SPEAKER_01]: light years that is, accurate to within
one light year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And further data on these stars may be
found in any comprehensive astronomy
[SPEAKER_01]: textbook or book of tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these stars, the 75 stars are all
listed in our astronomy books and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: all bright enough to be seen with the
naked eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: The planets will be listed in their
orbital order from the innermost planet
[SPEAKER_01]: out and the names will be those used by
the inhabitants, if any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, names used commonly by the
alliance to designate them will be shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inhabitation codes include uninhabited,
COL, colonized, IND, indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: population, and billions of inhabitants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Length of day and hours to one-tenth,
that's in Earth hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diameter and miles, length of years in
Earth years, and the allegiance,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's an alliance planet or a
confederation planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a third federation here,
it's a Calran federation that is in
[SPEAKER_01]: opposition to the first two and they don't
allow anything to be released to the
[SPEAKER_01]: alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the confederation planet, so the
Calran empire is quite different and we
[SPEAKER_01]: find them in opposition to both the
alliance and the confederation and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will turn up later on as we go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not to be considered a
comprehensive list of planets of the
[SPEAKER_01]: alliance, but rather intended to acquaint
the readers with only those nearby stars
[SPEAKER_01]: easily visible without telescopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the first one is Alpha Canis Majoris,
which is Sirius.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this group right here, there's the
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 8 light years distant from us,
8.8 light years distant from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one on the list there,
Periton, is colonized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its population is 42 hundredths of a
billion, that's probably 4,200,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: The length of the day is 27 and 9 tenths
hours of Earth time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diameter of the planet is 5.709
million miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its comparative year is 64% of our year
and it belongs to the alliance of planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one down here is Vuden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's colonized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its population in billions is 1.6 billion
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The length of the day is 19.3 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diameter is 6,320 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its comparative year length is 1.94,
almost two of our years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it belongs to the Omega
Confederations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the Omega Configuration is going to
come up again a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Omega Headquarters, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next one below that does not have
an indigenous, is not populated and
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have any, it is populated but only
with an indigenous population that hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: looked out from its planet yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still stuck on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next one below that also is
inhabited, but the inhabitants,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's indigenous, it's not colonized by
either the alliance or the confederation
[SPEAKER_01]: and doesn't belong to the Omega.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third one also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the fourth one, Vectra, well it's
about the sixth, seventh Vectra and right
[SPEAKER_01]: in there are two planets that are both
colonized.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one has a population of 1.96
billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its length of day is 31.5 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diameter is 2.88, 2,880 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comparative length of year is 7.45 of our
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it belongs to the confederation of
planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other besides the alliance in our
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one below it also belongs to the
confederation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is In Sirius, just a few
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do all of these,
but I'm just going to show some examples
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sirius, by the way, this, let me back up
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chart we had here, this is Sirius
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has 12 planets on the list there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine are occupied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kaldan, the third one down,
as I said before, is the Omega
[SPEAKER_01]: headquarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Omegans are apart from the alliance
and the confederation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one of Sirius is the brightest
star in the northern sky, Peritim.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top one right there has a population
of 40, 42 hundredths of a billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 4,200,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a research planet for high
temperature equipment, among other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one of import here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Damat, which is the fourth one down
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Damat has a population of 4.9 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fourth planet out from the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a major military system for the
alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest go on from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we won't go into that at the moment
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can come back to it if anybody really
wants to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure we get some more stuff covered
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me buzz down here a little ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all star charts furnished by the
Corinthians listing major stars and the
[SPEAKER_01]: planets orbiting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in the little e-book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can study them in detail if you
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why we got a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting some dropouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's the last of the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which shows a summary there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can find my summary card here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows the 25 most important planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shows that 75 of the brightest stars
to the naked eye were listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 15 of the 75 have no planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now our astronomers are having a little
bit trouble finding planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they believe that if we find another
star with planets, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may tend to prove that there could be
somebody else besides us in this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: vast universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Corinthians see that about 90% or more
of all stars have planets, families of
[SPEAKER_01]: planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the 75 that they listed for us,
only 15 have no planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: 252 of the planets are inhabited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 165 of those known planets are not
inhabited.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 417 total planets in the 75 star
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Korondor is the third planet out from the
star Korina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot of papers up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of Korondor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's seen beyond our tourists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 411 light years from Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the third planet out from its star,
Korina.
[SPEAKER_01]: The capital city is right in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rel city is the capital for the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over three times the size of Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the top scientific planet of the
alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best in our galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the home of NDWA and major
industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major city is Burrell City.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has more land mass for water than we
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has about 60% land mass, where ours is
probably less than 30%, 35%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bigger planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three times the size of ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a stronger gravity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the planet is three times the
size of ours, it only has 3.2 times our
[SPEAKER_01]: gravity, which is quite a bit for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that an Earth human standing on
the surface of Mars, of Korondor,
[SPEAKER_01]: if he fell down, he's likely to break
bones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he stood in a Korindian rainstorm,
he'd be pelted to death by the raindrops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't visit Korondor in our Earth
bodies very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: They explained to Bob that all planets
that have evolved life forms, as we see
[SPEAKER_01]: from the listing here, most of them do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like the leaves of a tree or
snowflakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no two planets identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no identical conditions on two
planets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The archetypical life form that evolves on
the planet is it evolves peculiar to the
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions of that particular planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for them to go to another planet,
sometimes it's too inhospitable for
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody to make the trip elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they discovered that in the process
that they use of coming here, they use
[SPEAKER_01]: something like a teleportation process,
where they step into a cabinet on Korondor
[SPEAKER_01]: and step out of a cabinet at the receiving
station in the base here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they had a base here, they had to
project the base to this planet and
[SPEAKER_01]: receive it at the projected base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was difficult because it limited
what could be transmitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they transmitted enough to build a
proper receiving port on Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they began to teleport their
equipment and people here directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they said, they told Bob Renaud,
they said, we don't look exactly like you
[SPEAKER_01]: in our native state.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if you could see us as we live on
Korondor, you would probably think we're
[SPEAKER_01]: ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, we think you're ugly
too when we look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Bob always saw those visitors as the
women were extremely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no fat ones, no skinny ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all pretty well stacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The men were good looking, strong hunks,
handsome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he thought, hey, must have a planet of
beautiful people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the Corinthians are explaining to
them, when they come here, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: teleported here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're received at the teleport
station here, their atoms are assembled on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Earth archetypical form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our ideal form for Earth in Earth
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they do look handsome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't archetypically visualize crippled
people, diseased people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were explaining to him what his
body would look like when they took him to
[SPEAKER_01]: Korondor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, the reverse is true when you go
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an archetypical form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we only got two minutes left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get there, they said,
your body will look like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they showed him an image.
[SPEAKER_01]: The image they showed him was a little bit
shorter than he stood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had very strong neck muscles,
had a heavy skull, strong neck muscles,
[SPEAKER_01]: strong muscular frame, stocky torso,
and legs to stand at increased gravity
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had the body breathed gas with a
richer atmosphere than ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was normal for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours is a little weak for the Corinthians
when they come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes the time for them to adjust,
to acclimatize to our less rich oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually, they invited Bob to come
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I started this, Bob Brown says,
what would you speak on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, from my age, I'd like to
look back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have pretty good hindsight now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that we threw out some very
important cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to talk about the Bob Renoud
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I started doing the research
on it, he put that in a bulletin,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put it out on his website that I was
going to talk about Corandor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about three weeks ago, I received an
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd been looking for Bob Renoud for 30
years, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just disappeared from sight altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't find him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I get an email letter from Bob
Renoud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that it had been his practice
to search the web and the E-net for any
[SPEAKER_01]: references to Corandor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corandor periodically for the last 50
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very seldom found anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he suddenly got a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found Corandor mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was going to be discussed at this
conference here at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to be the speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked me up in the web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got my web page, which gave him the
email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me an email letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I see you're going to talk
about my case.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, you know, I haven't been putting
anything out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, it's not really for public
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, they don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes too long to educate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I don't mind if you want to talk
about the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said, the case is still going on,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I have had contacts ever since I
terminated the arrangements with Gabriel
[SPEAKER_01]: Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I gave some information to John
Dean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, I just stopped sending
information out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said, I've been making notes all
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I have hundreds of pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have hundreds of pages of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to have some?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, I sure would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three days later, I received a big CD in
the mail from Bob Renov with 400 pages of
[SPEAKER_01]: new information, contact notes on his
contacts since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd been to the moon twice more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd been to the planet Corandor
several times, working there and operating
[SPEAKER_01]: there in his Corindian body.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he steps out of the teleportation
cabinet in Corandor, he's in his Corindian
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he comes back here, he's in his Earth
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I have done a little writing
on the moon trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said, I have written nothing on my
trips to Corandor because they suggested I
[SPEAKER_01]: not do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, the first one was a business
trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next one was a recreational trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I could probably describe the
recreational trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he says, I have never written it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's had a couple more trips since
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they welcome him when he gets there as
an old friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of his contemporaries are still
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live an average of 1,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live an average of 1,000 years,
whereas we live shorter lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the people that he interacted
with are still there or still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have their bases here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one underground in Massachusetts,
one off the coast of San Diego underwater,
[SPEAKER_01]: one in the South Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have some bases in other
countries now also and speak the other
[SPEAKER_01]: languages where they're expeditionary
teams happen to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have, by the way, they have
prepared what they call agents of theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're people that have been
especially trained and conditioned to live
[SPEAKER_01]: here that move out into our Earth society
and are maneuvered into positions of
[SPEAKER_01]: semi-authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said some of their agents are in
the Pentagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are in the White House.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are in Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are in the Senate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, they have successfully
infiltrated our population to a great
[SPEAKER_01]: degree, as well as the governmental bodies
of Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, the collapse of the Russian
empire and the close of the Cold War is
[SPEAKER_01]: due to, in some extent, to the
contribution of our agents working
[SPEAKER_01]: internally and quietly to tamp things
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, we are still trying to keep
things a little better organized on your
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'll have to give up because
I'm over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank you for your kind attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that's been informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Wendell.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up for Wendell, the one and only.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we will keep this break as
short as humanly possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, that'll just be 12 minutes,
15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 minutes maximum for tape changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand by.
