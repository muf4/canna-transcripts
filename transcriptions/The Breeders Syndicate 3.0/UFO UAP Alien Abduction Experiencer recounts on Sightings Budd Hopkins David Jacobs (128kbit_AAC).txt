[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on a table and I've seen
something removed from my body that I will
[SPEAKER_02]: call a fetus.
[SPEAKER_02]: The baby was so small I couldn't believe
that it could live on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember putting my finger in the arch
of its foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was afraid to look at the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was afraid to see what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There seems to be an enormous interest in
the emotional side of this too and the
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the aliens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want us to hold these odd little
children, these babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to see how a mother will hold
and love a child, things which to us are
[SPEAKER_01]: instinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The abduction phenomenon begins usually in
infancy or at least by the age of two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues all through childhood,
all through maturity and into old age as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have many cases where the person is
taken as a child, usually what we'd refer
[SPEAKER_03]: to as the bedroom visitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was laying in bed, I opened my eyes and
here's a little gray standing there
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at me and all I could really
remember were those dark eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is as if that person has become a kind
of tagged animal in someone else's
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment and that little person as they,
as he or she grows to adulthood will be
[SPEAKER_00]: abducted over a period of time at
irregular intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us assume that this is all being made
up, that this is internally generated,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is no abduction phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the case then we have discovered
something of enormous importance.
