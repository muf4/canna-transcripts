[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-dog, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tonight, I thought we would go over a
little bit, because last week,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of you remember, we didn't get to a
lot of questions when it came to the Hopps
[SPEAKER_01]: latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to get to a lot of
interactive questions for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: For various reasons, we had to kill the
comments last time, so we didn't end up
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing a bunch of people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the viroid is, unless I
really pontificate a lot, I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: the viroid is a whole show.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if people have questions, if people
have general questions that they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: ask, tonight would be a good time to lay
them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought one of the things that I really
took away from the viroid topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think this is the first thing that
jumped out at me when we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the different techniques people use
for cloning, and if you have an edge
[SPEAKER_01]: that's cut where it's a wound,
as she called it, you can't use arrow
[SPEAKER_01]: cloners with different strains,
if that's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really kind of wipes out that whole
situation for being a viable product in
[SPEAKER_01]: this market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's an aspect of that,
and then there's actually some new tech
[SPEAKER_03]: that coming out for, or not new tech,
but there's new to cannabis tech that's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of being pushed right now for
cloning, which I think is pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I actually believe, or I believe,
I should say, is a big addition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've seen some people try to get around
it, but people have been asking about
[SPEAKER_03]: cloning tech and safe practices,
and then there's also been a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that have been asking about,
and this kind of sucks too, but they've
[SPEAKER_03]: been asking about drying and curing and
how to get better weed, which,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be honest, it's actually one of the few
things I'm hesitant to talk about because
[SPEAKER_03]: most corporate people grow shitty weed,
and they don't realize what corners to
[SPEAKER_03]: cut, but then I don't necessarily want to
deny a bunch of home growers and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that better technique either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a weird- Corporate assholes
aren't watching this shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were turned off to me a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird conundrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people want to hear about drying and
curing tech and a way to get better
[SPEAKER_03]: tasting weed, you could start throwing it
up in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing she addressed, and a lot of
people, like I said, were arguing about
[SPEAKER_01]: before the show and even after,
was the relevance to Hopps Layton showing
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the Progeny of Seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I thought about it all weekend,
a bunch, about different clones that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been used that we know pretty sure have
Hopps Layton.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that I know for sure had it when I got
it back in the day, and we didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, at the time, was Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giselle is well known to have some kind of
sickness, and later on it got tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have HLV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giselle's been used in a lot, a lot,
a lot, a lot of stuff, and we've never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen any Progeny from any Giselle anything
show any of the dunning traits on their
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is it in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, but I mean, the Progeny doesn't
come up for it in the test, so that 8%
[SPEAKER_01]: number seems awfully high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one thing we should probably mention
that's important, and I think we brought
[SPEAKER_03]: it up on the previous show, is that most
of the stuff she was talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is where people get mad at
science, especially to use the COVID thing
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever, is because if science gets
proven incorrect, they think it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how science is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's correct until somebody can prove that
it's incorrect, or there's a different
[SPEAKER_03]: technique, and that doesn't mean that
like, you know, I mean, it's obviously
[SPEAKER_03]: like what we know at the time,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of what she was trying to express
to us about hop latent, because cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: is not very well studied, are other
viroids similar to hop latent,
[SPEAKER_03]: and other studies done, there's not a lot
of work done specifically on hop latent in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was trying to give us her best
explanation on what was ongoing currently,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think- That's educated guesses based
on available information in other
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, or not even just cultivars,
other, I don't know, species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you know, and there's an aspect
where people are asking about false
[SPEAKER_03]: positives.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with any kind of test,
there's a decent percentage for false
[SPEAKER_03]: positives that can exist, and then I also
think that just because you get a negative
[SPEAKER_03]: test once doesn't mean you're exactly in
the clear either.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I think there's that,
and you know, sadly, with the
[SPEAKER_03]: proliferation of cuttings now these days,
and the lack of cleanliness and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, I can safely say that like,
I mean, maybe you can map to speak on this
[SPEAKER_03]: before, but in the early days of like
clone training and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody worried about this stuff at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not stuff like that, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, in the early days of clone
training, when I first was entering in,
[SPEAKER_01]: the term dud had barely just started to
even be, I think it was even years later,
[SPEAKER_01]: a few years later, that they even like,
hey, this thing might be a dud,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like- And then, you know,
there's been for a long time, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think dudding, dudding is a term we use
in cannabis to basically describe a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that's acting unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't, I think that hop slating can
be a cause of dudding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I also think that there's a
variety of other diseases and probably
[SPEAKER_03]: unknown viruses and things like that that
could also come up later that are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get spread around, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think she was fair in that
what she told us was best knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of unknowns,
and I think that a lot of like the basic
[SPEAKER_03]: cleanliness and maintenance techniques,
which are not common in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: need to start getting applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all that is good technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to get people to do that
with germinating seeds for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: using as sterile a technique as they can,
because it does matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people do the old like,
well, if a plant in nature drops,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, seeds in the ground,
naturally when they pop up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do whatever and put whatever,
and you don't have to be clean to pop
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it does matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're spending a good amount of money
on seeds, it really does matter to the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you buy a $2 pack of tomato seeds and
you don't get that great of a germination
[SPEAKER_03]: rate, nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you give Matt Riot $300 and you don't
have good tech and four of them don't pop
[SPEAKER_03]: and now you're pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because cannabis seeds have a tendency
to be expensive, you know, you probably
[SPEAKER_03]: want to take the small extra steps needed
to like get as much success as possible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so, you know, there's an aspect where as
she was saying on the on the show before,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I do believe that there's a
potential for people to clone out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't think that's an
impossibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like she made a very good point in
that the viroid is extremely tiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all it takes is one little bit of it
to be able to replicate itself and slowly
[SPEAKER_03]: come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so what I actually think is is,
you know, what people should probably do
[SPEAKER_03]: is, you know, is have a quarantine
situation and people put plants into
[SPEAKER_03]: quarantine to check for, you know,
russets or or broad mites or other pests
[SPEAKER_03]: or things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably advisable to maybe get a
cheap test a couple of times on an
[SPEAKER_03]: important plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and hopefully we'll have a
situation like I was mentioning before,
[SPEAKER_03]: where like eventually they'll make
nurseries, you know, have a clean bill of
[SPEAKER_03]: health.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen we've seen any number of
clones of private clone sellers have to
[SPEAKER_03]: temporarily shut down their clone selling
because, you know, customers have been
[SPEAKER_03]: buying expensive plants and then it ends
up positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an interesting question about
the superdog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I would say that did I
there was a lot of when people someone
[SPEAKER_03]: just asked for people that aren't seeing
it when I was we were doing all of our
[SPEAKER_03]: superdog seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we find sour phenos?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say, yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so much in low look more in nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's definitely there's
definitely, you know, the the the pathway
[SPEAKER_03]: we took to sour to superdog is a little
different than what happened with sour
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that when you cross skunk and
chem in certain ways, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: certain things that come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look through careful with that
terminology, remember, most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to think you're talking about skunk
one when you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, we actually we we actually
considered today to bullshit for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually considered doing a whole show
on Skunk One because it is such a it's got
[SPEAKER_03]: such a long history and it's got so much
misconceptions these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does seem like Sam Skunkman might
be giving a rendition of his opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so maybe we can follow that because
it's always it's always good to get the
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and and and then, you know,
we'll have an idea of like what because
[SPEAKER_03]: lots of lots has been said.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's been he's been invited on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he knows that he has a standing
invitation to come on and talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: anything he wants to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but so people are clear, you know,
because Matt, you know, Matt's right is
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, Sam intentionally bred all
skunky aroma out of Skunk One for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's made that claim consistently over
a very long period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does seem like the first plants of
skunk that he brought over to Holland had
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit more skunkiness in them than
the later ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, there's an immense amount
of people that have been looking through
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk One for skunk and now finding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like the skunk that got used in
sour was a blend of different skunks and
[SPEAKER_03]: then blended into super skunk and then
some other accidents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of it's it's not it's not a
clear path.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say a blend of different skunks,
are you saying a blend different skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: ones or are you using it to turn a
different term?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt and I have Matt and I have have some
connections to the the gentleman who bred
[SPEAKER_03]: that clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's given us, unfortunately,
like a lot of these old timers from the
[SPEAKER_03]: 80s, you would like a well written out
lineage with exacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was mostly he bought things from
SSSC and from Neville that had skunk in it
[SPEAKER_03]: and blended them together for two or three
years and then crossed something of that
[SPEAKER_03]: into super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got the skunk that became
famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, again, are you say skunk very freely?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing skunk one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume I would assume so because
he said he was buying skunky things from
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville and and and Super City of the Seed
Club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was he was buying hybrids and he was
blending them together for two or three
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe he even referred to that line as
skunky skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunky skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, skunky skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and then and then he took that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first year that that Neville
actually released the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, which is sort of a line that puts
skunk back into skunk as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if if if he's correct and he's telling
us the truth, which I don't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: reason to doubt, it seems like half of the
thing that became very famous is a blend
[SPEAKER_03]: of Neville's and Super City of the Seed
Club work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And half of it is super skunk itself from
the first year of from 1990.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from that on, there was some
hermaphroditic accidents and there was
[SPEAKER_03]: this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gets even more convoluted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's you know, in order for in order
for Neville to find skunk, he had to take
[SPEAKER_03]: the skunkiest things thing of skunk one
that he could find and cross it to a
[SPEAKER_03]: totally unrelated genetic maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for for whatever for whatever
that work that is worth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, someone just asked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is it is from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a gentleman that was,
you know, older than us and involved in
[SPEAKER_03]: dead tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he he did, you know, they did some
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like a lot of a lot of 80s breeding he
didn't have a bunch of notes and he didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: come out with this was step one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was step two.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was step three.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much more general.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when we interviewed when you
when you and Conza interviewed Greg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a few specifics and a lot of
mysterious, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't a lot of detail on the NL's
as far as specifics.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so be that as it may,
like we're not going to actually do we're
[SPEAKER_03]: not going to actually do a big skunk one
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is probably worthwhile to go over
it at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe we'll pick up where,
you know, we'll fill in gaps and comment
[SPEAKER_03]: on what Sam is saying soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I have a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just like such a much different
take on skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that it has to do with it,
like it's just it's a different take
[SPEAKER_01]: because I wasn't around like during those
early eras to have bought skunk one from
[SPEAKER_01]: like the first year it was produced or or
even smoked anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My only skunk ones started much later,
you know, in the in the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my experience with it is only the
clones that we have left, the old clones
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've run a skunk one like the cheese
and other stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other stuff with heavy skunk one
influences that I learned over time were
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar to what I am seeing out of
skunk one seed lines like the pure from
[SPEAKER_01]: Flying Dutchman we got to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't see anything capable of
producing anything like the turps we would
[SPEAKER_01]: see in super skunk or not turps,
but essentially see in super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even looking at everything that skunk
one touches and breeds outwards,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just never seeing anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's interesting is Matt and I got
to interview Karel from Super City of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the questions I can't remember
who was when you asked him or when it was
[SPEAKER_03]: my section of it, but I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did mention that the skunk that got
brought over in 84, 85, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: was different than later open pollinations
and later breedings and that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little raw.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think even Sam said that there maybe
was a small possibility you could find
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that in there, but then
later on it was basically out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the recent scams that have
been going on in the last five or six
[SPEAKER_03]: years are turning on that hope that,
oh, my skunk is old enough that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to find in there this thing that Sam
hadn't bred out yet, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I see some pretty cool comments in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a people were talking about pot of
gold, which I love pot of gold,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is Hindu by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was another thing, you know,
that was from the Flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm correct, I believe the Flying
Dutchman was basically a I don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: say a front for Sam, but they seems like
they bought most of their wholesale seed
[SPEAKER_03]: stock from Sam because Sam was willing to
sell wholesale within Holland,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not willing to sell retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, you know, there's another
guy that just asked if silver pearl,
[SPEAKER_03]: we both describe silver pearl differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that people have the same
grows of the same bud to people have
[SPEAKER_03]: different interpretations of the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people have different people
have different, you know, they get
[SPEAKER_03]: different noses off things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can get different effects off things,
you know, and silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pearl is actually an early poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there can be different expressions off
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in that regard, it's because I
believe it's it's early pearl by lights,
[SPEAKER_03]: northern lights by skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And early pearl is early girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, it's a hybrid of a whole
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a whole bunch of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy that it was so consistent to
like as far as its expressions being that
[SPEAKER_01]: much of a poly hybrid, it makes me wonder
how much work went into it beforehand for
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be so consistent, like with its
expressions that it throws.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's another there's a
gentleman in the in the thing that was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that now we're getting a little off
topic, but he was saying that Maple Leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: Indica is probably the last thing that
Sensei has that is original after the
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch raids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe that, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know and maybe a little bit of
history is is required there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Maple Leaf was given to Neville by a
character named Jim Ortega.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville sold it raw, as you as it
were, at the seed bank for about three
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when he got busted and he sold
his company to Sensei Seeds, it
[SPEAKER_03]: disappeared off the menu.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, Matt, for what was like about
eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: About eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it reappeared probably about
1999.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reappeared on Sensei's catalog three or
four years after Neville had left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as near as we can determine,
that was no longer the original Maple
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a hodgepodge of a few different
Maple Leaf phenos crossed the skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Neville had made its made it Sensei,
but was unreleased.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not pure Maple Leaf anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, after the bust,
at some point, Sensei outsourced most
[SPEAKER_03]: almost all of its breeding to Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would I would love for there to be
some original things from Sensei left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't put any trust into,
you know, I don't put any trust into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen stuff from Sensei that came out
post, you know, 2000s and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_01]: that looked like super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually looked like it, but none of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all very Skunk One dominant type
scents, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you know, Skunk One,
sadly, it's it's you know, it's got Skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: in the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people really want to associate it with
that, you know, but it'll forever be done
[SPEAKER_01]: every few years by the next Yahoo that
comes in and declares, I've got Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brand new.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm I'm a little bit more people
are talking in the comments again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll just kind of ramble for a
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people were talking in the comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Scott and Neville did a lot
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't seem to be too terribly true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little bit more of a Shanti backer
than most in our crew, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it does seem is that,
you know, Neville partnered with Shanti
[SPEAKER_03]: and Greenhouse after Sensei.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Neville had a partnership a bit
with Shanti at Mr. Nice Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville did sell some of his old
collection of seeds to Shanti,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it doesn't seem that they were heavily
involved together for a lot of years in
[SPEAKER_03]: actual breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the sense that you got talking to
Neville as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sense I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sensed a lot of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, a lot of you know,
there's, you know, so anyway, it Shanti
[SPEAKER_03]: legitimately by Neville's own own
admittance bought Neville's own old
[SPEAKER_03]: collection of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they certainly partnered together both
at Greenhouse Seeds with Argent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at Mr. Nice for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of them both being in the
same breeding room together, doing a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of work over a number of years,
it seems like as time goes on,
[SPEAKER_03]: that seems less likely than it was before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the wildest ego battle I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a Star Wars level ego
battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But be that as it may, maybe we could
maybe we could scroll back a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: now because we got we got way off topic
there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, when it comes to like hop
latent or just clean practices in general,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a there's a new, you know,
I've seen people like get like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, like the restaurant style,
like, you know, like red ketchup
[SPEAKER_03]: containers, and they squirt a little bit
of gel into each plug and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so you don't because one of the
big things is that all of a sudden we're
[SPEAKER_03]: learning you don't want to dip a raw cut
into a liquid or a gel that then you dip
[SPEAKER_03]: another raw it's basically like an open
wound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't want to spread the viroid,
you probably don't want to like share the
[SPEAKER_03]: same liquid with hundreds of different
open wounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice if they just have a
little squeeze bottle with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, though, one company used to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that seems cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is this thing that's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this gentleman I don't usually
give shouts out to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but I'll say there's a guy on IG
called slow nickel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's an agronomist.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he mostly does stuff with,
you know, he he mostly seems like he works
[SPEAKER_03]: in South and Central America growing a lot
of different kind of crops and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he makes this really interesting
point, which divides with me really
[SPEAKER_03]: strongly, in which he does this thing
that's incredibly counterintuitive to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is that when you take your Rockwell
cube or your router, rapid router plug or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you're using, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He dips just the tip of the actual cut
itself into some kind of rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he sticks that clone so that the
actual cut itself is not in the cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it's actually sticking out of the
cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that is he said that
what you want is that you want that open
[SPEAKER_03]: wound to form a hard callus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once it forms a callus,
then the roots shoot out from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why it makes so much sense
to me is he says if you leave this raw
[SPEAKER_03]: open wound, and you stick it in a Rockwell
cube, or you stick it into a rapid router
[SPEAKER_03]: or something, it'll shoot out a bunch of
roots, but it's too moist for it to form
[SPEAKER_03]: that hard callus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then essentially, you have an open
wound that allows a lot of opportunity for
[SPEAKER_03]: fungal or virus or other various things to
get in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which makes a lot of sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and he's shown a lot of examples
and a lot of people seem to be really
[SPEAKER_03]: jiving onto his method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does make sense because if you
think of like human skin, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's a big barrier against disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, the callus is
essentially a scab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You form a hard scab and then the roots
start growing out of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then so that's pretty new for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are just using to stick the
cutting into a Rockwell cube or stick it
[SPEAKER_03]: into a rapid root or whatever,
and it goes from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually, having seen his tech and
looking at it and reading about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely, totally agree with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been experimenting with it for a
while and it makes perfect sense to me and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's changed how I do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you know, one of the things that you
have to do is like a lot of times you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: have like an insert that you'll stick into
a tray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll stick your Rockwell cube
or your rapid router so that actually the
[SPEAKER_03]: stem that's sticking out is a little
elevated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just like touching flat
against the tray itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the fuck you're
talking about when it comes to hanging out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how are you going to have it hanging
an inch above the plug when it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: float in the air?
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, it's more like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine, I mean, this is, this is going
to look a little salacious or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: but imagine this is your plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people would just stick it and
leave it inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what he's saying is that have the
actual end pop out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Penetrate the bottom side.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if that little callus stick,
if that sticks out the bottom,
[SPEAKER_03]: then the actual cut end will callus over
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, like if you guys,
like if you're, if I'm not describing it
[SPEAKER_03]: well, you can look up slow nickel on IG
and he has a really good, he has some good
[SPEAKER_03]: tutorials on a lot of pictures on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it basically, what his basic
technique is, is just dip the routing
[SPEAKER_03]: hormone a little bit in that cut,
have that cut callus or seal off like a,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a stab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it roots from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it doesn't allow this big open
pathway highway for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusarium or disease to get up into your
plant and cause issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about air embolisms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that used to be the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everybody was, don't get the fucking,
and I, you know, as funny as back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, I remember Bony showed me this,
this clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone showed me this clone tech for,
for, I just want to say for the crew,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I, when I did the, when I did my
little visual right there, it did feel
[SPEAKER_03]: slightly fifth grade ish, but here we are,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the people on audio that didn't
get to see he bent over and it was real
[SPEAKER_01]: weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but yeah, if you, I don't usually plug
people, but if you, if you want to go look
[SPEAKER_03]: up slow nickel, he has a bunch of examples
and pictures on his page of the tech that
[SPEAKER_03]: you can go and make them and make a lot of
sense of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does make sense to seal the wound.
[SPEAKER_03]: To not have an open wound that allows
fungal matter and different stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that to get in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the problem with that is that if you're
going to do that thing, like you were
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, where you're going to inject a
bunch of gel into a rapid router or into a
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, you know, that's, that's,
that's, that's sticking the plant into the
[SPEAKER_03]: cube again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so and you know, like you were
saying, before in terms of slowing down
[SPEAKER_03]: hop latent, it makes area flows,
shitty technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really better make sure that the
clones you're putting in an area flow are
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you absolutely will spread it to
every other clone in that area flow or in
[SPEAKER_03]: that, in that, you know, area cloner or,
you know, whatever, whatever brand you're,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a bunch of raw wound cuttings
getting sprayed down.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the same liquid over and over and over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a breeding house for disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never liked those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I just couldn't ever keep it
consistently clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all it took was one little pathogen
vector and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be in the motor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be everywhere in those damn
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you, if the biggest issue with
those is that you want to keep your water
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature in the mid sixties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where you get the most oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A chiller is kind of nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and then on top of that,
even if you have fungal diseases,
[SPEAKER_03]: like say Pythium in your water,
Pythium can actually reproduce below 68
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It absolutely can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why like in rivers and streams or
ponds or whatever, if you see cold water,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's usually clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And warm water is usually not interesting
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, there, you know,
I, all of a sudden my, my, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my comments paused and now they just
unpaused and now there's a million things
[SPEAKER_03]: going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but anyway, um, you know,
cloning tech, he, it does seem like,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, he is showing cloning tech that makes
a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as a general, as a, as a general
vibe, um, ceiling, ceiling off the wound,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and not allowing, and not
allowing rock going on there is a big
[SPEAKER_03]: deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, you know, people might have to
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I used to, I used to dip all of my
cuttings in the same solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really, in order to slow down the
hop latent or slow down other diseases now
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're worried about, you really kind
of have to look at like your whole process
[SPEAKER_03]: and look at every step because you can't
do all, you can't do most of the steps
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then have a centralized thing where
you're screwing it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew a lot of people who would keep moms
and use aerocloners.
[SPEAKER_01]: To, you know, re reinvigorate their moms,
you know, keep their rooms going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be a technique of the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big, the big problem that I used to
run, I used to run area cloners when I ran
[SPEAKER_03]: water culture, the big issue that I had
with them when you're running them in soil
[SPEAKER_03]: or something else is that if you use a
rapid root or you use a rock wall plug or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that, it just gives the,
the clone itself an anchor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have like a, you can have a rooted
cutting with beautiful roots all coming
[SPEAKER_03]: off it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you transplant it into some soil
or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't stabilize it the right
way, there's nothing really, it's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: stick with some roots and it has a
tendency to move around a bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, but really what it is,
is that he's shown it a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times a root rot or Fusarium or
Pythium or whatever else can go right up
[SPEAKER_03]: into your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times your plant can recover,
but those plants end up yielding less than
[SPEAKER_03]: others or being weaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like it was just an
unrealized weak point in a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_03]: cloning method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which is cool because now that one of
the, there's not been that many benefits
[SPEAKER_03]: of legal weed, um, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, one of them might be that
some actual agronomists and actual people
[SPEAKER_03]: can bring some different techniques that,
you know, might, might improve,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, cannabis culture,
um, and how, and how we do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, before I forget, I want to say some
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I hadn't even told you yet,
but, uh, land race genetics, I think in
[SPEAKER_01]: the coming week or so, and this is going
to be on their time over in Afghanistan or
[SPEAKER_01]: Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember which part he's in right
now, but he's going to take us through a
[SPEAKER_01]: field as they're harvesting over there
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that fucking cool?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going to try to set it up with the
farmers there so we can go live from the
[SPEAKER_01]: fields, uh, in the Mideast essentially to
watch some of the harvesting go down,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the technique and maybe help us
talk to some of the farmers and translate
[SPEAKER_01]: for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll, it might be at 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: or 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: or 4 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to wake up and do it
whatever time it is because that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the other side of the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody coming in, I seen a pic of that
NL5 tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're talking about
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I put up a pic of NL5 today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, we have a whole episode on
Northern Lights with Seattle Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please go watch that if you want to
learn about Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have most of our episodes touch
something on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights at some point,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Pakistan, Tarah Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the building blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it's so ancient, there's a lot
of, there's a lot of funny claims popping
[SPEAKER_03]: up now about, you know, ancient NL5 lines
recently rediscovered, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this and that, pure Neville, this,
that, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would y'all rate NL5 Haze on a one to
10?
[SPEAKER_01]: I still got to read some more stuff too
real quick before we jump into all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think NL5 Haze is the most
successful publicly released hybrid in
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's probably more high
quality clones from, from that line that
[SPEAKER_03]: are still alive today and circulated than
probably any other line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Realistically speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually why I rate it so highly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just personal preference.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that there's literally like,
usually we're lucky if there's one or two
[SPEAKER_03]: at most, you know, cultivars that have
survived from their original era that we
[SPEAKER_03]: know are, are, are, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with NL5 Haze, there's probably like
over 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is pretty incredible for something
that was basically from 85, 88,
[SPEAKER_03]: 89 to, you know, 95 or 96 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would probably be fair to say
Cookies Bagzeed stumped the shit out of
[SPEAKER_01]: NL5 Haze as far as cuts distributed now,
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think that one probably swept the
market, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but what I'll say is that proof
will be in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, a lot of these NL5 Haze
cuttings that are still around and kept
[SPEAKER_03]: are 25 to 30 years old, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give, we'll give Cookie another 15
or 20 years, and we'll see how many of
[SPEAKER_03]: these original clones are held onto and
hoarded by future generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's really the key to staying
power.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have all the hype you want,
but you know, it really better be good to
[SPEAKER_03]: have people keep coming back to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So time will tell, you know, it,
you know, one of the, one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: about Cookie is that it's so much more
modern than NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think just by the law of
averages, there would be way more of it
[SPEAKER_03]: that would survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only reason, the only reason why
it's going to survive that long,
[SPEAKER_03]: or you're going to have that many cookie
cuts survive for that long, is if people
[SPEAKER_03]: really love it and really appreciate the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies probably, we'll see if it'll stand
the test.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, I will say that that's not
exactly a fair comparison because what I
[SPEAKER_03]: was basically doing is comparing things to
like actually released seed lines,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, where cookies was more like it
got famous as a cut and then bag seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: occurred and then various hybrids occurred
where, you know, it's not like AK 47 or
[SPEAKER_03]: NL5 Haze or Silver Pearl or something
where you could buy seeds of it for a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of years from a company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then NL5 Haze never actually
really ruled the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our buddy Crybaby is commenting on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Skunk outsold it a lot, Neville
said.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was other things that were a lot
more popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying that I don't think any
cut, I don't think any seed line has as
[SPEAKER_03]: many different phenos that have survived
as long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that might be fair to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, because there's,
there's a number of them in Europe and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a number of them in America and
you start adding all those ones up and all
[SPEAKER_03]: of a sudden you're at, you know,
10 or 12 clones that are 25 to 35 years
[SPEAKER_03]: each.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a theory and I think Crybaby
probably has a similar theory based on
[SPEAKER_01]: what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've talked about it is that Super
Skunk might have a similar history,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we just don't know enough about the
cuts that are out there that are Super
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk cuts yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the things that is,
that really sucks from a historian
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, is that Americans especially
are very good about giving counterculture
[SPEAKER_03]: nicknames to their weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of, a lot of the original
genetics that came over in the eighties
[SPEAKER_03]: and nineties are obscured because they got
some, they got a name and then we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what they are anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that there was an enormous
amount of Super Skunk that was sold,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was probably given nicknames.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we believe that, we believe that the,
that it's likely that the Puck is a hash
[SPEAKER_03]: plant from Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it got the nickname the Puck with one
crew and then it got the nickname the
[SPEAKER_03]: Skelly from another crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skelly Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Skelly Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skelly Hash Plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the snow, I've talked about that
before, the snow was called Skunk 5 in
[SPEAKER_03]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was called Eugene Snow in
glassblower circles in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Humboldt Snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt Snow when our buddy Caleb got
ahold of it in the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people talking about the dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dog shit was called Electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt and I, Matt and I and friends of ours
have been like debating whether or not we
[SPEAKER_03]: think what we think that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of plants got nicknames and
those nicknames obscure, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what origin it might've come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so far, because Philos is a liar and
other groups are liars, we, haven't,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would be amazing if we had like
a genetic ability to test things and that
[SPEAKER_03]: Corell and Neville and Sirius and these
various groups had their original shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could just, they could just put
that up into a database and then you could
[SPEAKER_03]: map out what came out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I also have a conversation soon
that I was telling you about with Mrs,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pronounce her name right,
Vergara, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Cornell University, their,
their cannabis breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very interested in talking with
her and she's interested in talking with
[SPEAKER_01]: us because the scientific community is
having a hard time understanding why the
[SPEAKER_01]: clones that they have now currently are
not lining up with what they're seeing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual genetic data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was talking with her,
I was like, well, there's a lot of reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: why, because what you're given is these
legacy clones that you guys think you have
[SPEAKER_01]: probably aren't what they say they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or aren't what Leafley, because they're
relying a lot on things like Leafley for
[SPEAKER_01]: their genetic data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like looking at, oh, Leafley says it is X,
Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it must be X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's enter it into our little database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the problem's always
going to be with, with, uh, academia
[SPEAKER_01]: versus traditional farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a pretty small group of
people that know and it's even harder to
[SPEAKER_03]: know that you have the legit cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even for historians like Matt and
I and Caleb and others and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes like the information that we
think we know gets turned on its head a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Mad Night, if you want to talk
about the dog shit for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so everybody knows, this is like
absolute speculation on my part.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people have thought that the
dog shit is an old NL5 haze phenome,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, I have thought perhaps that it is
a old silver pearl by haze phenome,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was called that in Neville's catalog
and then later it was just called silver
[SPEAKER_03]: haze from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that would explain why it's
prettier.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I would explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it doesn't really actually look like
the cough or the A5.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not as wild as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a much prettier hybrid,
but it has the haze effect and it
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly has that Neville's, you know,
that Neville's like feeling to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it looks like it has something
else in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, that strain was available from
about 88 on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and was available from Neville's
catalog and from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, you know, that's total
speculation, but there's not very many
[SPEAKER_03]: things that came from, all we know is that
it came out of Minneapolis, Minnesota area
[SPEAKER_03]: in the early nineties and came West.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the rest of it is just
observational.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking NL5 skunk one haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've seen a lot of pretty NL5 skunk
one haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like from, from Delta nine labs,
they did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They recruited the gods and that was an
NL5 skunk one haze or like a, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So silver Pearl times haze would be early
Pearl NL5 skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's really close.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just basically described,
you know, uh, you know, um, and I'm not,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, that's just complete speculation
on my part due to the timing of the seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the plant is telling me the fact that
the plant is prettier and quicker than
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the other straight NL5 haze F1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it's just a guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's a, it's a good guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's fair because you can look
at it and see, um, if I'm looking at dog
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, it has the, it has a lot of resin
production for like an NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it were an NL5 haze has really good
resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes to the edges and tips of the
leaves, even on some of the, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: not fan leaves, but bigger leaves,
uh, water leaves that aren't families.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I remember Neville telling me that
trait specifically was from skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know it has skunk one in it
somewhere, I think based on what Neville
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, I think your, your, your,
uh, silver Pearl is very, very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting, uh, synopsis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, could it be?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly, like I said, the seed,
the seed was available during the time
[SPEAKER_03]: that it popped up in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, there wasn't honestly barely
any haze hybrids available on the market
[SPEAKER_03]: then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown personally, a lot of skunk one
haze, uh, from Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely isn't that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got other things in it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, but you know, it also could be,
uh, something unknown that turns us on its
[SPEAKER_03]: head, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people ask me about stem rubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, stem rubs are, I,
there, there are some turps occasionally
[SPEAKER_03]: that come off stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you, I would put myself in the,
in the classification of in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the rare plant that I get much off a
stem rub in vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can smell stuff, but it rarely
does it transfer to flower for it to mean
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to me other than this plant
smells like this in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, interestingly, I lost it in the
fires, but that old Tanjo cut I had,
[SPEAKER_03]: that was from the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be carrying a tray of,
of, you know, of one gallon pots or
[SPEAKER_03]: something, and you would get whiffs of
citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in veg, but it's pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I always tell people like,
if you want to smell roadkill skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: go get like the poodle nuts cut,
or even an Urkel in veg, take a cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: sniff it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but, but it doesn't transfer to
fucking flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, like Urkel is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very great, it has some skunky
tones in it, but mostly grapey and sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, it, it doesn't,
not everything transfers, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, like I've seen breeders
be like, yeah, this shit fucking reeks in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's skunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, oh yeah, they give you like
a, they give you like a sommelier list of
[SPEAKER_03]: smells and homos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe their schnoz is just a lot
better than mine and their brain works on
[SPEAKER_03]: a different level.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am always amazed at some of the
depth that people can get off a basic stem
[SPEAKER_03]: rub.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have had some plants that definitely
gave me some turps that were identifiable
[SPEAKER_03]: and in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, for me personally,
it's a little, it's, it's more rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so, you know, and it's
usually something simple to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: like citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, it smells like leather with
hints of raw cherries and a backbone of
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, I don't get a lot of
complexity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually something simple shining
through, you know, on that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, one thing I never hear is,
is I smell chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one thing I definitely smell in
veg when I rub something is a shitload of
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people were asking me, what do I think
about the, you know, I did get a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: Caleb selections from Matt and Caleb's NL5
outgrow that they did when they,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they grew a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, in my part of California,
it is extremely hot and nasty,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially this summer in summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was waiting for more opportune
weather to give those a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, real quick, I'm going to talk about,
we have the, the right to use.com sell
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see how many people actually
listen to this buy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the coupon code is invisible 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to work for this weekend,
40% off anybody who uses it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, if you use it on there,
you watch the show and you get to save
[SPEAKER_01]: 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've put up some, um, red menace,
which is the Bubba flow hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: the blueberry scone, which is the wedding
cake loop on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the blue cream, which is the,
uh, we were talking about a silver pearl
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the perfect pearl from Pipsweed,
um, which is a silver pearl S1 across to
[SPEAKER_01]: the blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those are up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those haven't been dropped before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think except for the wedding cake
one early on and invisible 40 gets you 40%
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: People keep commenting on my beard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, uh, I do, I do a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, um, I work outside a lot in summer and
so it helps with, uh, SPF.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps protect me from aging,
you know, faster than I already am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's handsome to salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only got a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting a little whiter on that
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more salt, a little more salt,
a little less pepper, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, but yeah, you know,
uh, you know, they, uh, we'll,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll see, you know, I think Matt and
Caleb, they're going to do, they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do some further work with that NL five,
you know, line hybrid, whatever it might
[SPEAKER_03]: be, um, picking out phenols that they like
and seeing what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, um, we have some really big
projects coming up, not just me with,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, CSI, but the whole group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's a few things we'll be able
to talk about soon, but I'm really fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some big collaborations coming
up with CSI on many levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, yeah, I mean the homie,
what's good about the homie is that he,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, not only does he do stuff that
interests him in terms of what he thinks
[SPEAKER_03]: might be like, um, you know, modern
cultivars and stuff like that and modern
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids, but he also does reproduction of
old seed stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's very willing to take,
uh, dubious seeds with a story and run a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of them and see, you know,
he'll let the seeds, he'll let the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: tell him what he thinks of it later on,
you know, because sometimes good seed
[SPEAKER_03]: stock comes from scandalous characters,
uh, you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, he does FEM seeds,
regular seeds, experimental projects,
[SPEAKER_03]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, uh, in a, in a land of like,
let's smash together all the most popular
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, doing some of that other kind of work
that doesn't really, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: might not fly off the shelves as fast,
but it's still valuable is really,
[SPEAKER_03]: is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, one I was, he was telling me about
the other day and I was like, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: always give him shit, like he'll make
stuff and he'll put it on his site
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes and not announce it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a fucking word.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be like, yeah, no one was really
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, bro, did you even tell
anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you tell them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I didn't know that you put it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was talking about a Mendo perps,
um, cross to, I think it was a Blackberry
[SPEAKER_01]: widow from Jojo Rizzo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, um, it was Elks, I think it
was Elkslayer who made it originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Caleb took it to F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if people remember, Blackberry
widow, um, it's very magenta, red,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and Mendo perps can spit that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he bred this in that red direction and
he's got an F3 seed run that he did ages
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, like eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just been kept in the freezer,
you know, and it's still got perfect germ
[SPEAKER_01]: rates, but you never really sold them,
you know, things like that blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even a multi-stage breeding of any kind,
uh, in today's economic environment is
[SPEAKER_03]: rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it should be supported.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because like most breeding projects,
uh, you don't get what you want in one
[SPEAKER_03]: step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, buckshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hawaiian life was doing great in,
um, Bakersfield heat outdoors too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was doing really well
shockingly because we were getting up into
[SPEAKER_01]: the 118s, 120s this year, 60 days of over
a hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, uh, we had California had one of the
worst heat waves in modern memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just this last in the, you know,
after Labor Day, which was really
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunate, you know, um, it took my,
a lot of my friends told me up in Mendo
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that, that they're,
uh, they don't think their weed is as
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I believe it because the heat wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's weird because when some other
breeders saying that the more heat,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more skunky it is, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I, you know,
they're, I, when it gets to that extreme
[SPEAKER_03]: heat, it's just damaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't want to be 115,
118 and then 80 or 90 degrees at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's just, that's just not
going to make anything happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think that like one of the things
that makes Mendo and Southern Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_03]: Trinity and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the really nice places to grow
outdoor cannabis is that you get a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: cool stretch at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a hundred degrees in the
daytime, but it gets into the fifties at
[SPEAKER_03]: night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that temperature differential,
I think brings out the crystal content,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Terps, some of the development.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that makes like, I always noticed
that like people in like grass valley or
[SPEAKER_03]: people that were more inland in
California, they would get these ginormous
[SPEAKER_03]: plants from the same strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't think they were quite as not
people from there are probably going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get mad at me, but I didn't think that
they develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think that their region
developed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just think that, you know,
if he hits 55 or 60 degrees at night or 48
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that, it brings out
something in the cannabis that if it only
[SPEAKER_03]: gets down to the eighties, it doesn't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep, you know, so, you know,
and I think too, it's like those cold
[SPEAKER_03]: snaps or, you know, it gives the plant,
it's just like humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they say that like one of the biggest
dangers with heat waves is when it gets
[SPEAKER_03]: really warm at night, your body doesn't
have a chance to recover from the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the biggest dangers is
extremely warm nights for humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the same thing could be true
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the cool nights gives the plant an
ability to recover from a really hot day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's 88 degrees at 11 o'clock at
night, boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, there were many nights here
where it wouldn't get under a hundred all
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking unreal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, so I, from, uh, multiple
friends have told me that they did not
[SPEAKER_03]: think that they don't think their plants
are quite as, which sucks for the current,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the current market and the current,
uh, economics of things, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was, it was a poorly timed heat wave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unusually late, you know, and yeah,
unusually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brutal for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, um, but you know, there's,
there's an aspect of, of, uh, that's one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the things about climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were, um, that, uh, is really
interesting in the sense that a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: times in, not just in cannabis,
but another agriculture, you pick spots
[SPEAKER_03]: that tend to suit what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the climate shifts, it might not,
it might not suit what you're doing as
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, as an indoor grower,
um, I didn't really take into account how
[SPEAKER_01]: much, uh, the weather in Bakersfield would
affect even indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's just, when it gets to a
certain point, it's so brutal that it does
[SPEAKER_01]: affect indoor growing even, you know,
like trying to keep the house cool while
[SPEAKER_01]: you're running fucking X amount of lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gnarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even that hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an, there's an old ass term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we use the, we use on the height of
the indoor days, summer bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Summer bud was not as nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as a lot of other types.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, like I, uh, we, you know,
where I live in Mendo, like granted,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to use the outside, which is nice,
but a lot of people would shut down in
[SPEAKER_03]: summer because they wouldn't grow as nice
herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And back in the day, you could get away
with like a little bit lesser indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but right now the market is just ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, summer run bud can be,
you know, there, there's, uh, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what to talk about when
it comes to the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's ever, it's ever changing and very
painful and has a bunch of people very
[SPEAKER_03]: nervous and, um, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've delved into that depressive
fucking talk enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, everybody's feeling that that is,
is deeply involved in the weed scene where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even people that, that is just a
hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the electric bills, look at it,
look at how everything's going,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even hobby growers are starting to not be
able to afford to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, California, sadly, um,
you know, its power is just through the
[SPEAKER_03]: roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so even just keeping yourself
cool, like the human part of your family,
[SPEAKER_03]: cool, uh, can be a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom will live in like a hundred degree
weather inside her house because she's an
[SPEAKER_01]: old miser, but, um, and if she hears this,
sorry, mom, but, um, her electric bill
[SPEAKER_01]: this last month, it was like $600,
which was, it was outrageous for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's never had anything even that fucking
close cause she will live and eat without
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of AC just cause she's cheek.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that blew her fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The $600 electric bill hit her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would imagine everybody's having a
rough time with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and then obviously like,
you know, in California, especially PG&E
[SPEAKER_03]: got, got made liable for a number of
these, uh, incredible fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they passed the buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, I mean, they, you know,
what are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Declare bankruptcy and go out of business
and you don't have power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a monopoly too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a reason we're allowed to have a
monopoly for an electric company?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's not necessarily a monopoly
cause I don't, you don't have PG&E down
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the only thing we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing you have is PG&E.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, it's the only option.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's hard to have a bunch of
competition because who owns all the
[SPEAKER_03]: transmission lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's responsible for maintaining all the
poles and all the power and all of this
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something like, you can just be
like, oh, well T-Mobile versus AT&T versus
[SPEAKER_03]: this versus that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's a little, there's a lot of
infrastructure involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water companies here are the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a choice on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a choice on garbage and you
don't have a choice on electric company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, um, it, uh, it's,
you know, I mean, when, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I first moved to Mendo, uh,
all the, all the diesel grows in the woods
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever, you know, diesel was a
dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's super expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, before, you know,
I, I, this is going to date me,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like before I was, I had an eight
lighter before, um, before the Enron fake
[SPEAKER_03]: scandal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2000, 2001, where they, they lied about
how much like the California had a power
[SPEAKER_03]: crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, my eight lighter was never
more than 350 bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they raised the rates right after
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was $12,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: $12,000 to $1,500 a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, crazily.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's a great, there's a great
documentary on that called Enron,
[SPEAKER_01]: the smartest guys in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to watch anything on it,
it explains it in detail how, how,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they played, they played us in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually got us to lock into
super long-term, extremely high power
[SPEAKER_03]: rates because the governor was worried
there was going to get even worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though they went down for fraud
and a bunch of the bunch of the top
[SPEAKER_03]: executives did long prison terms,
we petitioned the federal government to
[SPEAKER_03]: break the contracts because they were
signed with a company fraudulently
[SPEAKER_03]: cheating California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Bush administration didn't let us
out of the, didn't let us out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shocking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's just been, it's been,
unfortunately for California, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: growing indoor, um, has been increasingly
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely prohibitively expensive,
prohibitively expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, you know, sadly the, you know,
the price of indoor is also is not heading
[SPEAKER_03]: in, in, you know, it's not like going up
with the cost of doing business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's really pinched a lot of
people, unfortunately, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, I mean it, uh, um,
there are certain places, like I think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's certain places in, in like,
in, in Trinity and there's other areas
[SPEAKER_03]: that tie into like hydroelectric power,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the power is a lot cheaper,
but everywhere that people like to live in
[SPEAKER_03]: California for the most part, like is
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even like I said, Bakersfield used to be
like one of the last cheap little bastions
[SPEAKER_01]: for, for cheapness in California to be
able to afford a home, but that's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's long gone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, being poor doesn't really work in
California too well anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: A fork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, Trinity, the problem with
Trinity is just, it's like, you might as
[SPEAKER_03]: well live Swiss family Robinson.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's remote.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy was just Siskiyou County,
a Southern Oregon power and it's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some hydroelectric that comes out
of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's certain counties in far
Northern California that have way,
[SPEAKER_03]: way nicer power than, um, any of the
population centers where most of us live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually want to ring rings on for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of you two shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could convince him, he would be good
one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a super weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been breeding for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has his own take on weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pretty, he's pretty sarcastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is, you know, him and I have done a
number of different projects together and
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a lot of similarities in terms of
like our approach to things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, yeah, it, uh,
um, you know, there's not, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not, you know, there's,
uh, you know, people that, that crack
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds every year and grow different seeds
every year outside and do breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: projects every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I don't want to call them a dying
breed necessarily, but they're rarer than
[SPEAKER_03]: they used to be.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I tell you I'm doing a new UFO podcast
Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_03]: You did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Nick is called invisible
residents and Tuesday we're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: our first recording of us talking for the
first time, like trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, I didn't know if you'd want to do
it, but I know UFOs aren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: your thing, but yeah, we're going to give
it a go and see if anybody gives a shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it will be interesting, especially
from a skeptical point of view on UFOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, um, I will say one thing about my
buddy rings is that he comes up with a
[SPEAKER_03]: series of very inappropriate seed line
names and hashish names.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would actually have to say that he
might, he, he might have the most
[SPEAKER_03]: inappropriate that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you, can you say this name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I say it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I, can I pump them out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, do, uh, uh, he has one called,
uh, your sister's innocence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another one called butt stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But stuff's a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, that's how me and him
first started talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you cross butt stuff to your sister's
innocence, you really start getting
[SPEAKER_03]: places.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a, he had a hashish line for a
minute that you remember heaven's gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause those, that's probably right up your
alley with all the UFO weirdos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you remember how they all had like the
Adidas suits and like the shoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So he, he had this image of like two Nike
shoes pointing up and then the Adidas jump
[SPEAKER_03]: shoot and it ends at the knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like a, and then like a
spaceship, you know, um, the clubs had a
[SPEAKER_03]: hard time promoting the, uh, the,
the heaven's gate, uh, the, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: the heaven's gate hashish line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, uh, it was a little too risque,
perhaps a little too, uh, a little too
[SPEAKER_03]: morbid.
[SPEAKER_03]: The humor was so black.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's rings humor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humor is so black.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and then there's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's ones that are,
um, that are worse than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't even make the public cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but yeah, I would, I would have
to say there's other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other ones I won't say,
but one of my favorite is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how do you get more your sister's
innocence?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's too good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, but he's, he's, he's
actually been in Mendel longer than I
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I moved here in 98.
[SPEAKER_03]: He moved here in like 94, which is
definitely a different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's been here through a lot of
different eras.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have been talking a bunch actually
about how, you know, we watched an
[SPEAKER_03]: enormous amount of people pour into our
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as the green rush happened and now
that the prices crashed, we're watching
[SPEAKER_03]: all these people pour out mass exodus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of people that came here
for different reasons, a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as that has gotten tighter,
they fled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I need to move up now when it's
going to get, it's good and everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it, uh, it, uh, where,
where can I find your sister's innocence?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, your sister's innocence is a
fleeting thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only there for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once it's gone, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, it's pretty hard to get
it back, you know, once it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: once, once it's gone, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's a, it's a brief period
of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a brief period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, but yeah, but you know,
Mendo Mendo is probably going to go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: To somewhat depopulated and weird.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because there was a lot of rich kids
that moved up here and faked being hippies
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever, in order to grow wheat and
have spending money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of people that moved
here for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that came up here
and bought property, um, and grew for a
[SPEAKER_03]: few years and then farmed it out to
friends and went and lived in the bay or
[SPEAKER_03]: went and lived in LA or went and in Santa
Rosa or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and they just like,
you know, took a skim off the lifestyle to
[SPEAKER_03]: do whatever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the economics of that are all trashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very likely that, um, in the next
four or five years, a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain properties are going to start
popping up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably mountain properties that are
reasonably set up too, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, and, and, you know,
Mendo still remains one of the better
[SPEAKER_03]: places to grow wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter about, you know,
survival and whether or not you like to
[SPEAKER_03]: live in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not you like to turn up in
weird fields with your soul missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: With your soul missing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, that's, that's, that's,
uh, what was that show called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Murder Mountain?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Humboldt, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's, that's obviously,
um, it's exaggerated to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also true.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it actually, it's also true.
[SPEAKER_03]: The area that they're talking about is
this place called Alder Point Road outside
[SPEAKER_03]: of Garberville.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that made Alder
Point Road pretty famous is that there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of places in Humboldt and Mendo that
are big parks.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of parcels, say like 40,
80, 160.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of how they got divvied up,
uh, legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and Alder Point Road had a bunch of,
you know, four acre, six acre,
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 acre, 12 acre, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it meant a lot of weirdos got more
tightly packed together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a cheap place to land in
Humboldt, blow it up for a bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then try to get out somewhere better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so you get a bunch of weirdos
all on top of each other, living too close
[SPEAKER_03]: to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're all on, uh, if you're,
if you, if you've got a bunch of 160 acre
[SPEAKER_03]: parcels or a bunch of 80 acre parcels,
you have some distance from people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a bunch of three acre,
six acre, four acre, eight acre little
[SPEAKER_03]: parcels, then you're all kind of stacked
up on one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, there's more
interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heels, them heel weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you confirmed with your buddy,
Tom Hill, if he's going to do the show or
[SPEAKER_01]: not?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, speaking of him,
the heel weirdos, uh, I don't think it
[SPEAKER_03]: would be insulting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we are hopeful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are hopeful to soon have Tom Hill on
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't think it's going to be live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll only be audio.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's probably only going to be audio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably going to have to go honestly
visit him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, at his spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but he has lived on one of the most
notorious areas of Mendocino County since
[SPEAKER_03]: the mid eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and so that in itself is an enormous
load of stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got an immense amount of weed history
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how he sort of got famous outside
of Mendo and our little circles is he
[SPEAKER_03]: became active on the forums in the early
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, Matt can speak to this too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, but he was along with Vic
High, uh, and a number of other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was kind of a giant on the early forums
in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he created Tom Hill's haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's credited with deep chunk,
which some people X 18 PTK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he, he's been around a lot of the old
school growing families and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: old school growing techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's seen all the different eras from the
camp and the eighties into the nineties
[SPEAKER_03]: into two 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, you know, uh, deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't actually hear it called deep
chunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in Mendo, we called it monkey
balls.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, some people called it deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people called it, um, uh,
Hindu death cabbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it had, it had a number of different
names, but it probably is the closest
[SPEAKER_03]: thing to an actual, like I see a lot of
times, uh, the chemist is different,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the chemist is also still alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and someone that Tom could speak on
extensively.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm actually really excited,
um, to maybe, to maybe chat with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and he's, he's definitely a little bit
reclusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we're hopeful to be able to do
sort of like a private recorded thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: we could put up later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he is, uh, to both Matt and
myself, I would say, uh, he's sort of,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, an elder, a hero, someone that both of
us looked up to, uh, while, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, while we were learning how
to, how to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he talks shit with the best of
them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like growing up, reading his shit talk,
like the shit he would say, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: damn, I want to be like that dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't fucking take no shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he was pretty famous for being caustic
online and on one of the lives,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I called him a cantankerous old man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and he reached out to me to say that
he's mellowed, um, which is pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, but, but I think,
I think very highly of him and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: really, he's like, people throw this,
this term around lightly, uh, or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, too lightly in my opinion,
but Tom is a legitimate cannabis OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a, he has, he has created a bunch of,
uh, really cool lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's been around for an enormous
amount of history.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a super character.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he was important in the forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot of people have bred with his
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he is, he's a bad ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every serious breeder I know has been
inspired by, uh, Tom Hill in some way in
[SPEAKER_01]: his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every serious breeder I know, uh,
he's an L he, he at this point,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's an elder in the, in the breeding
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and his work speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, I'm not going to name where it is,
but with the, some of the, some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: areas that he's lived in for a long time
are what I consider to be the beating
[SPEAKER_03]: heart of the Mendocino cannabis scene,
um, from way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so it would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody that's listening tonight,
um, you know, hopefully, um, he's someone
[SPEAKER_03]: to listen to.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's someone to look up to, uh,
and it's not easy to be a cannabis lifer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is not, uh, coming from his era
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, I say this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, it was just as dangerous back
then to deal weed as it was anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people had to fuck with a lot
of stuff and it was a different time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different kinds of crazy
characters were involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's cool about that perhaps is that
the, I don't think I can't predict exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: where the conversation will go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to go up there and barbecue
with them perhaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe I'll have a wide ranging
conversation, but, um, it could,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could, you, he could talk extensively
at just about the history of where he's
[SPEAKER_03]: at.
[SPEAKER_03]: He could talk extensively about a bunch of
his own breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: He could talk extensively about the
strains and the type of things that were
[SPEAKER_03]: around in the various eras.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's a lot of different directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could probably have a series of talks
with him about certain subjects and really
[SPEAKER_03]: get some places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, hopefully it happens soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's expressed interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he likes what Matt and I are doing,
which is extremely humbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I generally didn't even
think he knew who the fuck I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's where it's at, you know,
like different era, different everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't predict when, or how soon or
whatever, but there's been some interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when that shit happens,
people should really listen because,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, he's been in it to win it
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he does have another interview out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely keep your ears peeled for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And regardless of what platform it's on,
he's worked listening to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're both, I, you know, I don't actually
listen to a lot of other week podcasts
[SPEAKER_03]: because they kind of drive me nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I will be listening to that one
because of, who it, who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to listen to the podcast for
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll even give it the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I might even, I might even
listen to the, uh, to the, the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: gypsy one, but I wouldn't go that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any interest in hearing
fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just, I'm just curious what,
what spin he spins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I wouldn't interview
that guy even though he's a, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a little bit curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt that that guy will ask him the
right questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can only, that's the thing
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if, if you've, if you're new to
breeding, what are you going to ask Tom
[SPEAKER_01]: Hill?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you know to ask him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what forms are left for you to peruse
to go look, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'm excited either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much, I, I, I've been trying to
research the chemists for, for many years
[SPEAKER_01]: and have gotten like absolutely fucking
nowhere except for like little hints of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who met him once and like said,
you know, X, Y, Z, but I can say I'm very
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the chemist is alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in his seventies and I thought he was
not with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, someone just asked, he did not create
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, um, you know, uh, Tom has his,
his view of how Urkel happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I get, if, if I get a chance to go
and hang out and we get the chance to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk, that will probably be on the list
because it's probably something that
[SPEAKER_03]: people would be interesting in hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to our good friends listening right
now, keep your calendar clear for December
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Emerald Ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like we may be doing another
Canna Luminati thing, which is private.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably be small, but for our very
good friends who go every year and listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to this, um, keep your calendars clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we were met Matt and I and some other
close friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of threw a party for a few years
for weed enthusiasts, breeders,
[SPEAKER_03]: heads, various things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really nice time for people to
get together and smoke a bunch of weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: shoot the shit in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it got fucked by COVID, uh,
for a number of years, but now that it
[SPEAKER_03]: seems like that's receding and times are a
little different, we're going to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, so that means I got to get
on, uh, you know, having some samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your shit ready, son.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, you know, um, so yeah,
I mean, people can reach out about that
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm not trying, we're not trying
to get inundated in invites.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not a close friend that hasn't
gone to one, it's probably going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller than the last ones even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even people that went to the last one
probably won't be heading to this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there, you know, there's, it's,
it's who knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the, the, the size and who's
coming and all that and everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to leave anybody out, but like we
it's, we're hoping it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe we can even do some
content from not like live, but maybe we
[SPEAKER_04]: could even like, you know, get some people
that year, but we had too much fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we had, it was, it was, uh,
it was, it was, it would be hard to,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's, it's cool to not have to think
there in that regard, just to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: hang out and chill and, um, put any info
on what kind of sour, I have my God,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of people that, um,
want to confidently tell me stories about
[SPEAKER_03]: my headband and my sour and what they
think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, I just think that
there's people that want to like have
[SPEAKER_03]: certainty where there's uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, it's hard, you know,
um, and with the recent batch of
[SPEAKER_03]: popularity with sour and headbands,
everyone wants to fill in the blanks on it
[SPEAKER_03]: on a bunch of different stuff,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we'll have to see how that
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your train wreck experiences?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking at my list here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're my train wreck experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you were, I mean, you're up in that
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any train wreck experiences?
[SPEAKER_03]: What I, what I'll say, what's interesting
about train wreck is that the first public
[SPEAKER_03]: thing I did as fucking not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess was I showed my face because,
uh, Caleb had a, a cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, that he threw and he asked
me to be on the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and so I was up there with him and,
um, you know, a number of different
[SPEAKER_03]: people, um, Kevin Jotri, uh, you know,
uh, just very various folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, one of the interesting things
that he mentioned was that because
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt was such a seed based place,
train wreck was one of the first named
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts up there that became popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and one of the things that became
popular about it was that it was frosty,
[SPEAKER_03]: yielded a ton, yielded a ton and indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made people a bunch of money.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no one bitched about, no one bitched
about the potency either on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was before it was, it was basically
before Jack Herrera, like I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: about before Jack Herrera, but it was
before Jack Herrera was common enough that
[SPEAKER_03]: people called things Jack, like when
people say Jack, when people say Jack
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps, um, uh, previously it was train
wreck Terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they didn't use train wreck
Terp back then, but they called it that
[SPEAKER_03]: train wreck nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look, it was train wreck was
probably one of the first super popular
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts in Northern California that had that
strong Terpenele nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and there's a lot of mystery to it
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not seem that, um, there seems to
be a number of different train wreck cuts
[SPEAKER_03]: that float around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There seems to be debate on, on who had
what train wreck when.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, our buddy pack is doing, has been
doing some stuff with some old school
[SPEAKER_03]: train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, he's made some killer
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's the GMO Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done some, some new school crosses,
like the GMO Mac stuff, but he's also like
[SPEAKER_01]: that blue dream train wreck one is fucking
stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, it's hard to find that the
old SE cut of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of people said the arcade at E
32, E 32 was a reference to like,
[SPEAKER_03]: they thought it was like 32 gen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was, there was just a bunch
of different rumors about train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, train wreck is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's a little bit like Urkel in
the sense that despite its fame,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, it doesn't have a clear storyline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, um, CSI said the same cause
I've, I've definitely picked his brain on
[SPEAKER_01]: it as one of my favorite old, old,
old school California strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked his brain on it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, some people, some people are
like, dude, that shit's too strong,
[SPEAKER_01]: too racy, too speedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's one of the ones that
gives me anti-anxiety high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people are asking various things
about sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't actually like, you know,
I've known JJ a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what sour he has.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, uh, I think JJ mostly breeds for
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I haven't smoked any of JJ's actual
flower from any of his clones he uses in a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't, I can't really comment on
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, there's aspects,
someone's just saying, saw a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: people saying they made crosses with my
cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's nice in the sense that it
appears that the podcast that Matt and I
[SPEAKER_03]: are doing is, is gaining popularity of it,
you know, uh, that people are saying that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're using my cut, even though I have
no idea who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they didn't get it from me,
but they're pretty sure they must have
[SPEAKER_03]: what I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then I'm, not obviously,
um, selling any clones or anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that or selling any seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it is people are jumping into the,
um, people seem to be jumping into the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the name game, unfortunately, which
irritates the piss out of Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, and then someone just asked any
info on original diesel, uh, original
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel in my opinion is a very misleading
term.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an original diesel out there,
uh, that a guy has, uh, it'll remain
[SPEAKER_03]: nameless.
[SPEAKER_03]: That basically just, it was the first
diesel he got.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he called it original.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Matt has a nice, I have it actually,
Matt has a nice cut of original diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also called Day Wrecker, which it may
not even be the original cut called Day
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrecker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also called Day Wrecker may not even be
the original cut called Day Wrecker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, there's a lot, you know,
and diesel also in, you know, I have some
[SPEAKER_03]: good buddies from New York and diesel in
the mid nineties was slang for,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, fireweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then don't forget, uh, archives,
uh, uses his original diesel, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Shroomy diesel, the Amish and also
referred to as original diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think his actually probably came
before the Day Wrecker as far as any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of provenance goes or providence goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I actually, uh, I actually don't think
that Jack is renamed train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I don't, I, I disagree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think they very strongly have a
similar terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but the bud structure, the high,
the way they look, the way they grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, there's significant differences there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, someone asked me to list the new
stuff on the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have the train wreck Trinity blue
bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think we've called that copper berry
because it has a lot of coppery terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, we put up some more of the pure coach
blue bonnet and the blue bonnet BX one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found some more of the triangle choke,
which we never sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave him a bunch of way, which is the
diesel, uh, I'm sorry, triangle diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the ones I named earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rewatch the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some I still have to add, and there's
some Hawaiian lights, specific directional
[SPEAKER_01]: open pollination breedings, meaning,
uh, me and Caleb's select cuts hit by all
[SPEAKER_01]: the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: We isolated some of that from the open
pollination just to keep those separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I'll have some of those up too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a bunch of stuff that people,
man, there's a lot of comments coming fast
[SPEAKER_03]: and furious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, people just asked, how do you get rid
of variegation on the chem and headband
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, sometimes you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on the cross, I suppose,
but, uh, chems and headbands tend to be
[SPEAKER_03]: very heavy feeders and they tend to be
heavy calcium feeders too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could try that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but when I say calcium, I don't mean
Cal mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, a lot of times they don't need nearly
as much magnesium as they need calcium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going to try, try to give it
more calcium and try to get a product that
[SPEAKER_03]: does not have a bunch of mag as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because you can overload.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, when, what is your definition of a
headband?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wait, like when you think of a
headband traditionally, I know there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canna Bible definition or whatever,
that it was like a Northern lights hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you think of headband,
what's the first thing that comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Scent wise or maybe high wise or
expression wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not that this, this might not be
fair or accurate, but when I think of
[SPEAKER_03]: headband, I think of the first cut I got
his headband, which is my LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think of a, a diesel type plant,
I think of a skunky type plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, and it turns out now that,
um, Manny and swell and Bondo and others
[SPEAKER_03]: have been talking more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does seem like the very first cut that
was called headband was the, was the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that the seeds of the first sour diesel
were found in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that they all claim that that's the
case that they had a cut they called
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, there was a pert, there was a
friend of theirs in New York that called
[SPEAKER_03]: it headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, there was a, uh, one of their
friends, Manny found some seeds in that
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel to headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and out of those seeds came the first,
uh, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's a bunch of other headbands and
there's a couple Loompa's headband and the
[SPEAKER_03]: 56 day, which we both consider to be like
renamed cushions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, uh, and then there's day
wrecker and there's other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That have all kind of headband was one of
those ones that the story wasn't well
[SPEAKER_03]: known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it allowed a lot of people to claim the
name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's probably about four or five
different cuts that all claim to be
[SPEAKER_03]: original New York city headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those have been discounted by
the people that had headband, which people
[SPEAKER_03]: probably don't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, uh, people talking about,
yes, Jack is an is, I wouldn't say Jack is
[SPEAKER_03]: an unworked super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that, that Jack is in,
um, uh, uh, you know, a stop along the way
[SPEAKER_03]: of that breeding project and Neville
didn't feel it was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he reworked it for a bit and super
silver haze and mango haze for that matter
[SPEAKER_03]: came out of that later breeding project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, and then people are talking
about, you know, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: sours and Karma's sour and res sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to, according to, you know,
them alone or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Rez got his sour from chem dog,
I think in 07 or 06 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see, I see people quoting fucking
Klopp and, and, and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't take that to the bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are podcasts he's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was almost a week after the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They completely conflicted with everything
he's ever said about sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's up anymore,
but it was for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're taking in his info and
immediately repeating his facts because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been a lot of research done on
that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody just asked if I wear glasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do wear glasses, but I'm nearsighted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't read the comments on if I have
them on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why maybe I sit a little close
and you might see me like staring or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone just asked about the cow 106 that
slow nickel is pushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never tried it yet, but I did pump
him as far as being an agronomist and
helping him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Helping with some of the cloning
techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: People seem to be really liking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's a product by a good
friend of mine who owns cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called plant amp.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's calcium chloride and it's organic
calcium separated from magnesium.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion is a better option for most
plants than Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most Cal Mag is created from calcium
nitrate, which I don't like as much as
[SPEAKER_03]: calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cannabis seems to need a lot more
calcium than it needs magnesium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So overdosing it hard enough with calcium
can overdose it in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I like I like those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like those two products separated
ideally.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, maybe I should maybe I should
nerd out for a second and say that when
[SPEAKER_03]: they were doing nutrients and they were
doing NPK is like the three macro
[SPEAKER_03]: elements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scientists considered calcium so important
they actually considered it adding making
[SPEAKER_03]: a top four.
[SPEAKER_03]: So calcium missed out being up there with
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium as they
[SPEAKER_03]: decided to make it a micronutrient,
but they made it a sort of a macro micro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the most important of the
micronutrients in terms of how much
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, how much plants like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's I think it's boron as far
as what plants like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think one of the most important ones
is boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember why, but I remember
hearing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to throw it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, there's there's there are
there's all of them are important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're not present in sufficient
quantities, the plant, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant needs all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boron in small amounts is incredibly
important, but in large amounts,
[SPEAKER_03]: it toxifies things and makes it more
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything does that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually in my my necklace.
[SPEAKER_03]: The woods in Mendo, there's a lot there's
regions of Mendo that have excessive boron
[SPEAKER_03]: in the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people would have a great
first year and OK, second year and a
[SPEAKER_03]: horrible third year and end up trying to
filter boron out of their mix really badly
[SPEAKER_03]: because it persists.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hey, before you get going on anything
else, do you know much about power flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk a little bit about that, because it
used to be a staple up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of people used it and had
some of their best harvest with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why it was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love power flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it still existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Power flower was a it came in a brown bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was designed to be gorilla style.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could plant directly in the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could throw the bag on the ground and
make an X and plant your plant and poke
[SPEAKER_03]: some holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could put it into beds or put it
into pots or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, it had enough food in it for
about three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that era, when you were doing
gorilla and stuff like that and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just wanting to water your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really what made power flower special
was that they they were digging some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the mix of it came out of this ancient
bog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a peat bog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a peat bog in that peat
bog long ago when there was basically
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, people weren't brewing
teas very much back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't any of these like biological
fungal bacterial products on the market
[SPEAKER_03]: like there's a plethora of now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that ancient biology really tended
to eat the organic food contained within
[SPEAKER_03]: power flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made it a lot more available than
other mixes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually they dug they they had
issues with the state and local and this
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they dug out the bog too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was sort of a it was environmental
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they it just it just wasn't what it
was anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a it was a snapshot in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the green rush that people
started using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People got really popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: People started using it more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: They started selling more and more of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That led to more peat.
[SPEAKER_03]: That led to more more use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that led to the state getting
involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually that bog ran out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I bring it up is because when I
was talking to CSI last he had mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: that the best sour grow he's ever smoked
because he's not a sour fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always talks about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he also says that the some of the best
weed he's ever smoked was sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has terrible taste in the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck his taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I breed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this one, he said Shibud grew the best
best sour he's ever grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he would use flower power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said he's never seen lemon and
stuff like that come out of sour before
[SPEAKER_01]: and these grows because it just never was
able to get flower power again and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he also said it was an amazing
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that the diesel family in
general is very sensitive to environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: factors, everything from soil to nutrient
to whatever else.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow sour diesel and living soil
or whatever and have it come out very
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, getting it to actually be sour
getting it to actually be skunky is kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: The diesel plants can come out like
they're usually good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the high is usually there but the
flavor profiles and all that and how they
[SPEAKER_03]: grow and how the buds form.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to someone about this today
and I've started taking to calling them
[SPEAKER_01]: diesels instead of sours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only because I've noticed that
a lot of people still that haven't grown
[SPEAKER_01]: like old sour cuts that aren't familiar
with sour still think of like the citric
[SPEAKER_01]: acid warhead type thing and apply that to
what they expect when they smoke a sour
[SPEAKER_01]: because people talk about a mouth coating
thing with sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know what that is, having smoked
sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when people think about that and then
they think of the word sour, mouth coat,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the citric acid type sourness
comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed a lot of people look for that
in their what they think would be sours
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's not necessarily what the name
means.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sour is one of those things where I'm
not going to sit here and call anybody a
[SPEAKER_03]: liar or anything like that because I
wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who am I to say that?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does seem like of the people
involved, there's a couple of different
[SPEAKER_03]: stories and you kind of end up having to
choose who you want to believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some certainty about certain
things, but it does seem like it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: multi-stage accident, for lack of a better
way to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it became so famous that there's
some people that wanted to put a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more certainty onto that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shit sounds better if you intended
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes you sound cooler if you meant to do
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But diesel in general, diesel cuts,
headband cuts, that whole family,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's one of my favorite families.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some of my favorite smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are highly variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are pretty good, which is
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially right now with the
resurgence in popularity, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: false stories being told and a lot of very
certain tales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably say this and regret it or
whatever, but there's a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_03]: are like, oh, my sour traces all the way
back to 95.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then according to the sour people,
the sour was actually found in the spring
[SPEAKER_03]: of 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would make it hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people's sour predates real sour
by almost a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why the term pre-pre was born.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, the pre-pre.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what's the earliest I can do
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go six months earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are talking about various things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't use this term very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really dislike IBL in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see the term IBL in cannabis,
you should be extremely suspicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that I could even think
that I would consider to be close to an
[SPEAKER_03]: IBL is Tom Hill's Deep Chunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see sour diesel IBL, I shit on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can think about inbred line and it's
like, oh, I've inbred it a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an IBL.
[SPEAKER_03]: An actual IBL has almost no, it doesn't
have phenols.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it doesn't have phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a phenyl basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a very, very, very narrow band of
expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't even like IBLs because there's
nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weasel couldn't have had it before 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really want to get into the
whole sour story because it's extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have an episode on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have various things on it and all
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But very quickly there was weed that was
being bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was bag seeds found out of that
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a couple of plants that were
called diesel one and diesel two that were
[SPEAKER_03]: grown out of those bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something hermed onto the diesel two.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sold some weed of diesel two to
Manny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Manny found some seeds in diesel two.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grew those up and called them sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like someone, this is the,
if you, it should never be in anyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: head that X amount of generations equals
IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: The generation has nothing to do with it
other than the fact that you can't find
[SPEAKER_01]: them in early generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that would mean that's not how it
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an IBL means you've achieved
uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that in any generation,
but a bad breeder can take something to
[SPEAKER_01]: F14 and never achieve uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say it a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe, maybe, maybe you can shit on
this or not, but to me, if you get a true
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding line, a true breeding cannabis
line means that it breeds true for at
[SPEAKER_03]: least one characteristic.
[SPEAKER_01]: One trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might breed true for multiple
characteristics, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has to breed true for at least one
consistent characteristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, a cannabis IBL means that it breeds
true for basically all the
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Several.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, it's, it has very little
variation within the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see is what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could probably plant out hundreds of
them and the variation within the line
[SPEAKER_03]: would be less than 5%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not even desirable for the most
part to have an IBL because you're really
[SPEAKER_03]: cutting off pathways for people to do
different things with the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're like a hemp farm wanting to
do a seed pop for vigor and you want a
[SPEAKER_01]: uniformity without having to do all the
cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like where IBL is shining.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so most people these days,
they're like, oh, well I have an inbred
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took it two or three or four
generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's inbred.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not an IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: People confuse linebred with inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: A line that's been linebred can be variant
and still have work put into it and be a
[SPEAKER_01]: line that's linebred, but it doesn't mean
it's an inbred line proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the hard part about it is,
is that, you know, it's like IBL,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, what are you even trying to get
out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you trying to get something that like,
you know, the only reason why an IBL would
[SPEAKER_03]: even be desirable would be if you were
trying to grow a whole bunch of consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in a field or something from seed
or greenhouse or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you wanted to grow from seed and you
wanted it to all be very, very close to
[SPEAKER_03]: each other in height, weight, branching,
THC, this, that, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in cannabis, we like things to be a
little bit variable so people have
[SPEAKER_03]: different choices of where they're going.
Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the term IBL is 99% of the time
misused really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to rage about it for years and then
I just stopped because it just didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: matter if people are going to use it
anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, it just doesn't exist by,
if you look up the definition,
[SPEAKER_03]: almost nobody, like, like I said,
I, maybe there's a couple other things
[SPEAKER_03]: that are besides deep chunk, deep,
deep chunks, really the only one that
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just Christmas tree bud from, Caleb's
pretty consistent and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so far and few between though,
like two, three things I could think of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And inbred does not mean IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inbred just, you know, people have been
asking about recombinant IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recombinant has to do with recombining the
genetics and it's usually a GMO term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is someone saying they're doing
recombinant IBL work?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not using the term correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no clue what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Rob Clark's book, says F7 is
IBL.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rob Clark also did good breeding,
understood breeding to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might've been able to take something to
IBL at an F7.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would make sense because he
understood the term.
[SPEAKER_01]: He understood all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: F7 does not equal IBL though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could take something that's incredibly
different, like something from Bodhi
[SPEAKER_03]: that's like a wild Cambodian and cross it
with some Afghan and take it seven
[SPEAKER_03]: generations and it wouldn't even be close
to IBL.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's no set amount of generations
that gets there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You either get there or you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy because it seems like,
wow, that's a real easy way to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it uniform?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you ever have to know about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing about it is that
like when people are doing like F-gens in
[SPEAKER_03]: regular breeding, the size of the
generation is so much larger, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the population they're picking at each
F-gen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The population is so much larger than most
small scale hobbyist cannabis breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: that doing an IBL project is just outside
the purview of most people's spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another term that gets used,
of course, in cannabis, and I do it all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time, is F1, the actual term F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most cannabis now that we work
with, unless we're working with like
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking land races or old heirloom lines
are going to be modern lines that are
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids or polyhybrids or poly poly poly
poly hybrids, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to, in the definition of F1,
it's combining two distinctly different
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of these are not distinctly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these are, you know, basically
Afghani type expressions to the extreme,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're crossing two like types,
that's not an F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't really have specific terms in
cannabis because it's such a wildly unique
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if there's any correct
terms for stuff like polyhybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: ex-polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite an F1.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people, someone just asked,
what's the point of going so many
[SPEAKER_03]: generations in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that in general, most breeding
these days is one step only.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be old school breeding and to use these
terms that get thrown around in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to do a bunch of stages of
breeding, you would have to have a goal of
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then however many generations it takes
you until you feel like you hit that goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and there's no set amount of,
you could hit that generation in F3 or F4
[SPEAKER_03]: or it could take you to F7 or F8 or it
could take you to F10 or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: It very much depends on your goals and
what you're trying to stabilize within the
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing is that,
like I said, you can have a true breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can have a true breeding line that's
only true breeding for one trait,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more traits that you try to make true
breeding within the same line,
[SPEAKER_03]: the harder it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you try to make something
that's extreme, like skunk one is true
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding for the most part for a few
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got great calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's got a few different things,
but it's got- It's got the resin trait
[SPEAKER_03]: that Neville talked about that's very
visible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the resin trait, you know,
it's got- It's got a certain what people
[SPEAKER_03]: call skunkoid type, you know, bud
structure a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it has a range of terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it has a range of other aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not true breeding in every aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true breeding in a few traits that
tended to be useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it tended to be bred to a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more true breeding traits you try
to add in, the harder your project
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that DJ, despite DJ's work
with blueberry being very odd,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing constant different, different,
constant F1s of every filial generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning two different types inside the
line, which is not usually done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite that, a lot of the blueberry stuff
I found can be really good at breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: true for certain traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the lines worked a little bit more,
like breeding true for purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding true for the blueberry terps,
breeding true for XYZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oddly enough, that's one of those ones
that you can actually get good true
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding traits, a lot like Mendo perps
even has a lot of certain traits that can
[SPEAKER_01]: breed true for type.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, maybe we can take it back
because we were talking about NL5 haze
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Neville was looking through his NL5
haze seeds, he was basically looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: few traits that he was after.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was looking for something that was 16
weeks or less because he thought longer
[SPEAKER_03]: than that was a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if it was amazing weed,
if it took 20 weeks, he shit canned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was looking for things with decent
yields and he was looking for things that
[SPEAKER_03]: had the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't looking for looks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't necessarily looking for flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was looking for time of finish,
bud structure and effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yield was super important too,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to finish, bud structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what I meant by bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bud structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was looking for things that threw bats
and yielded fairly solid compared to like
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of wispy calyxes and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he had three things he was
basically looking for, time to finish,
[SPEAKER_03]: the high and making it yield enough that
it would bud structure and yield so it was
[SPEAKER_03]: worth taking it that four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he might have found some amazingly
phenomenal stuff, but he was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, it's 21 weeks, screw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more traits you start to add to
look for those things, the harder it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be to find it in a single plant.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why I avoid, or I try to avoid using
males that are super polyhybrid types with
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of expressions to narrow what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have projects, I can use it as a
tool as opposed to wondering what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody wants to talk about flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we could talk about flow without
doing all the blueberry talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about flow and then Matt can
talk about flow because we probably have
[SPEAKER_03]: our own different takes on flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow interested me because it was
incredibly beautiful looking and DJ whack
[SPEAKER_03]: waxed poetic about how it was almost a
pure sativa, but it was done in that seven
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't want amazing cannabis that's
done in 49 or 50 days, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had the, it had the look.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to have a very up energetic
high, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and when we did the, I was at the,
like I mentioned before, I helped Jason
[SPEAKER_03]: King and one of the Canna Bible books,
uh, get a lot of people so we can get a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of pictures and, and helped with a
bunch of the projects and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at the Canna Bible party,
I bought like 450 seeds or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, direct from DJ, um, probably Oh
three ish or two ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and one of them was flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got about a hundred flow seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I grew, so I grew out a lot of
flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was pretty disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was especially pre cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a lot of pinks, a lot of blues,
a lot of purples, lavenders, very pretty,
[SPEAKER_03]: very feathery, not a lot of flavor,
not a lot of high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my experience with flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can, I can understand some of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I fell in love with flow because you
know, like, uh, a lot of other people I
[SPEAKER_01]: was, I was falling in love with purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time flow was one of those base
purples that people use to, to inject,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, beautiful colors into their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've grown flow from DJ stock,
modern DJ stock, something I purchased
[SPEAKER_01]: from him in the past few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run stock from, uh, alkaline man,
I believe it was who did the, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Rose flow, which is some of the stuff
I added to the site tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old Dutch passion release of flow is
very different from the modern DJ flow I
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, I mean, it's a beautiful
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can breed, breed true for a lot of
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very floral, perfumey smelling from
what my experience is with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, the Rose flow from, um,
alkaline man was like rosy, perfumey,
[SPEAKER_01]: but way more heavy on the Nog Champa
incense, which you can also find in modern
[SPEAKER_01]: flow too, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some flow is very cushy looking almost
with the, the negativity structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: but those big, you know, the, the wide
space, what DJ called a stretch Indica,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's let long node spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, God, it's a gorgeous plant,
but it really, I've never really met
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone goes, I love smoking flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never met anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I love just smoking pure flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never met anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for me, I wasn't a fan of the Colorado
flow at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I do not like that Terp said it
reminds me of like, uh, a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: pronounced turned up Mac one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm not a big fan of that Terp
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that floral, perfumey, but it's very
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colorado flow is super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of the prettiest flow cuts,
um, green works was talking about DJ's
[SPEAKER_01]: flow cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another really pretty nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I, I have a lot of
experience with the Dutch passion flow and
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaline man's work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we put in the,
um, what do we call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Red menace that crossed above it because
Bubba would, I kind of wanted to make
[SPEAKER_01]: another, I've crossed an Oregon purple tie
to Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've now had crossed the flow to Bubba
to see what would a different Afghani type
[SPEAKER_01]: that wasn't used in blueberry or in DJ's
work would, would do across to something
[SPEAKER_01]: like flow to see what direction it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, um, you know, I, I'm not, I'm not
trying to dis DJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you can find amazing stuff in a,
in, in every, in a, in a single pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you can go through a bunch of
seeds and find nothing that you're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that, um, you know,
when I was growing those, those lines,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially five, six years before cookie
even popped up, uh, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: colors that were quite rare in cannabis
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just never found the Terps and the
high in the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you could have found an
extremely attractive plant that had nice
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor and I, the way I wanted it to,
uh, I would have liked that better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just never was able to find something I
thought, uh, got to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot like, a lot like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, flow does best in hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's where it shines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, uh, I think when, when,
uh, you were interviewing red and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, Chimera, uh, Chimera made a pretty
good point, which is that, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: he sort of considers all of DJ's work to
be one line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, and what's, and what's nice
about it is that, um, it's, it's inbred to
[SPEAKER_03]: the point where, um, you know,
it, he didn't add a bunch of other stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sort of is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I think DJ took the breeding
perception of, oh, I see these phenos in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now if I take these phenos and I
breed them together, I have flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I take these phenos and I breed
them, I get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I take these phenos and I breed
them, they get that, but they're all from
[SPEAKER_03]: the same general stock, just taken in
different directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so sometimes that works better than
others, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it seems like DJ's work is much
better suited to out-crossing to something
[SPEAKER_03]: very different than itself, then within
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like it shines more in hybrids
than it does as a, as far as my personal
[SPEAKER_03]: preference, I'm not going to like,
maybe like his son's going to go,
[SPEAKER_03]: JD's going to get all fucking mad at me
and fucking scream or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: His daughter gets real mad all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but, uh, whatever the case may
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a good question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you mind saying if more of the cuts
you keep are from someone else gifting or
[SPEAKER_01]: you hunting seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are, are, are cuts I've
acquired, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my collection is pretty weird in the
sense that it's basically entirely suited
[SPEAKER_03]: around my tastes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I didn't collect it for any other
reason that I liked the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's only now because most people
didn't collect cuts and didn't hold on to
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been a resurgence and a desire
for some of these old famous things that
[SPEAKER_03]: all of a sudden these things have been
sought after.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's certain things that I have a
lot of depth in, in my collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's other things that I don't
prefer that much that I don't have very
[SPEAKER_03]: much of it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because it wasn't collected to have
some kind of like comprehensive database
[SPEAKER_03]: of all weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a, what's a, a scent profile that
you would like to see in cannabis that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have not yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, maybe, maybe I'll cheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there is a scent profile in cannabis
that, um, uh, I like a lot and I have not,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I would love to see a plant that
translated it into flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love a real bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the bubble gum that's out there,
I, there are plants that I think smell
[SPEAKER_03]: very strongly of bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recall smoking things that make me
lip smack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just had some big league chew,
you know, or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's, there's some aspects of
I've, you know, there's some, maybe some
[SPEAKER_03]: juicy fruit bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's some, like, there's some
flavor for profiles a little bit like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, but you're straight classic pink
bubble gum flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that from the, um, the 95 cents you
start, you know, that was bubble gum
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was super turpinoline bubble
gum and it would come through super like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, turpinoline does just fucking
amplifies everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what, um, the Indiana
bubble gum needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did grab a bunch of the Durbin bubble
gum from Caleb for that reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's questions going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt won't let me answer how many moms I
have, uh, for, uh, upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say you guys, there are limits to
plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the fuck would you want him
documenting anything about plant counts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will, but I, but I will say that
when it comes to important cuts,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like having only one mom of
certain things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and the most important things to me,
not only do I not like having one mom,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I do like having them backed up with
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Oh God, people want to have fucking
rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously he wants us to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott, you know, reach was involved in
early clone trading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he has a lot of respect from a lot of
different people, so I'm sure he's a great
[SPEAKER_01]: guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't interact with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really grow any rare date and
stuff at the time because I was making
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've heard people love that flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard people love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who made it for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that was something Scott from her
nightness made or something Fletcher made
[SPEAKER_01]: from archive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's some headbutting that went
on there, so I don't want to speculate,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's, there's an aspect of,
I will say that, um, most of the reason
[SPEAKER_03]: why people don't keep, um, moms more than
what they're currently growing for,
[SPEAKER_03]: for, you know, modern times is because
it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time consuming and it's a huge pain
in the ass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wish more people did it,
but, um, uh, we could have an episode on
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term mom health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, I'm, I know we mentioned
it at the beginning of the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been bugging about it all
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too late now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we are going to run a little over than
we normally do because people have been
[SPEAKER_03]: chatting a bunch, but I'm not going to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk about dry tech today
simply because it's too deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too detailed of a topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should do that for one of your solo
things that I've been trying to get you to
[SPEAKER_01]: record forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's an aspect actually where there
is a bunch of solo content about some
[SPEAKER_03]: historical stuff that's about to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I know I promised it and, uh,
it's right in the middle of my growing
[SPEAKER_03]: season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so of course, like it's, it's awesome
for me to like, be like, Oh, I'll come out
[SPEAKER_03]: with all this new stuff right in the
middle of like, I got plants everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, but, uh, I, there will be some
historical stuff coming out and what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do with it is I am going to talk
for five or 10 minutes about some specific
[SPEAKER_03]: histories or specific strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very likely that I'm also going
to make a, like an IG post with possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: some pictures and some more information
and a brief description.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people can go on our,
our, uh, our podcast and see like a little
[SPEAKER_03]: short and, and, and listen, it'll probably
be mostly, uh, uh, audio, uh, to back up
[SPEAKER_03]: the post.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't be like video chat like this is
right here, but, um, it will, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to do some historical stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will be coming soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just right in the middle of grow
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, uh, it's a, you know, and Matt can
tell you where to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does the pitch on all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well start busting it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, first off, uh, like again,
I had it pinned up here the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the audio listeners, uh,
this weekend, um, I don't remember what
[SPEAKER_01]: the date is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like the 16th of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this weekend, 16th of September,
uh, coupon code invisible 40, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll get you 40% off for the weekend on
riot seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have my spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 40% off too, for this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take advantage of it while you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have the copper berry, which is the
train wreck Trinity blue bonnet,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pure blue pure kush blue bonnet blue
bonnet VX one triangle choke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue cream, blueberry stone, red menace,
some of the Hawaiian light stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, some of it, I still need to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Santa Cruz, um, goat farm
stuff, which is the train wreck fem,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, fem hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got my podcast coming up next
Tuesday about alien shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to watch that, it's the
invisible red, maybe I'll throw in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just mentioned it real quick,
but we got a buddy that's on our discord
[SPEAKER_03]: that we chat with all the time pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was just mentioning the pack goat
farm stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, pack has been releasing some,
uh, train wreck and some other lines that
[SPEAKER_03]: he's held close for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's been breeding and in my opinion,
which is one of the best ways to breed,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is with stuff he likes a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so Matt has some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, look up for that for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to plug that a little bit
more than one sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but he's a good homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on our discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's another person you can ask questions
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Matt's got some of his stuff that
we've been selling.
