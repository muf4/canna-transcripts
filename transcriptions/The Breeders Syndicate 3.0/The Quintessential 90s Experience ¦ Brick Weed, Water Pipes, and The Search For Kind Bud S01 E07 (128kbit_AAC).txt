[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with our other host, Notzodog,
and welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to take you through a
little bit of the 90s subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Notzodog both have majorly
different experiences in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in two different parts of the
state, and in his case, in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were at different ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is going to be a good one
to rattle off about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we're also going to answer
some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, since we just dropped
that Carell interview a few days ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: if people have questions or clarification
that they want about a bunch of the stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll spend some time chatting about that
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's kind of going to be a
little bit of a wide ranging discussion,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we'll just kind of freeform
it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's start off with your 90s
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, I mean, 90s experiences,
you know, we talked about in some previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes, we did a bunch of stuff on the
80s and the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt and I are not that old,
frankly, so don't have any weed growing
[SPEAKER_00]: experience from the 70s or the mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 90s is where both of us start to come
into the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of us start to have actual real
experiences of what was there,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, Matt originates from the West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I originate from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very different experiences going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, other places talk about
what was your first highlight and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we need to spend very
much time on that because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: boring to be perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I will say that, you know,
so I'm a little older than Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first started smoking weed in
the in the very early 90s, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said in previous talks,
you know, there was some books,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize at the time how
inaccurate a lot of stuff was in high
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read it as gospel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I could go back and read a bunch of
stuff and be like, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nobody takes that advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, I mean, I was totally
ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, growing up in Chicago,
there was essentially two kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was brown Mexican and green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was predominantly that's what there
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no other kind of import that I
ever saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very occasionally, there was some hashish
a little bit, but brown and green
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the green Mexican tended to be a
little bit nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best stuff was not that compressed and
didn't have that many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to call that 3060 weed because it
was thirty dollars an eighth and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: sixty dollars a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brown Mexican was more 2040 weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was more twenty and eight forty a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brown Mexican could have
enormously different levels of compression
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by compression is how much
they squished it to get it across the
[SPEAKER_00]: border.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was squished with stems,
seeds, buds, everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to fluff it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's kind of that's kind
of how I started was smoking brown and
[SPEAKER_00]: green Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what we had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no glass pipes unless you went
on dead tour and saw Bob Bob's non grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of pipes that you could get were
stone, clay, metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bongs were essentially plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Illinois and Chicago, there was no
you couldn't even buy that in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a single head shop in the
entire state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a couple of shady gas stations
where you could get some very cheap papers
[SPEAKER_00]: that they would claim were for rolling raw
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even those places would get hassled by
the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, you know, I had to drive to
Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to drive a good two, two and a half
hours away to get to a head shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even even access to be able to buy any of
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had to smuggle them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: To our spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no easy access to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I saw damn we were paying
off the ass for brick we.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the there was no the amount
of the amount of demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, Chicago is one of the big
cities in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a metropolis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an enormous amount of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I there wasn't there wasn't a
bunch of California weed like there is
[SPEAKER_00]: today flooding the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't at least maybe maybe there
was for certain circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my teenage ass, no, yeah, I didn't
know anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the funny thing about the actual
spot, someone said in Kenosha,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual spot in Kenosha was called
Supreme Video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it actually was, was a huge porn
shop that you had to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to get to the head shop
portion of the porn shop, you had to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: through a ginormous porn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, literally, you know how
they have like the glass glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass, like push beads and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had those but dildos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you literally had to like walk through
like a wall of you never wanted to run
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards through it naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, you know, generally speaking,
I didn't get naked in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, you would go there and
there would be all kinds of metal pipes,
[SPEAKER_00]: stone pipes, few clay pipes, graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was really all there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, getting clubs and all
these high end papers that you have right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, they had, you know, the jbs,
the Ritz, like they had all the basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was no raw, there was no,
the the papers were pretty much cigarette
[SPEAKER_00]: papers back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it was literally like
Supreme Video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a huge porn shop with a
head shop behind it, that you had to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: through to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was two and a half hours away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even even access to that kind of stuff
was was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, zigzag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even back then, this is totally
different subject or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, the high end beer back then was
like Heineken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was probably like three
microbreweries or four microbreweries in
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even what we considered high grade of
that was pretty midsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I mean, the level of
the level of knowledge that gets spread
[SPEAKER_00]: around right now is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was a lot of rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of innuendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of stuff you learn from some
older smokers, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I made Matt when we were
planning this episode, I made Matt laugh
[SPEAKER_00]: because he had never heard of a resin
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was news to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a resin chamber is, is if you got
like a metal pipe, and the pipe had the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking part, and then it bent and had the
long piece that you puff off of,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would have a fat chamber that
unscrewed, and you would put your nicest
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican weed in that chamber, your nicest
bud of the eighth or quarter you bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would smoke that because you would
be getting free THC all over your bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would smoke that bud last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, essentially, we skipped that process
and went ahead and just scraped the resin
[SPEAKER_01]: and just didn't didn't smoke any buds
inside that little chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that people put shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was literally called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally called the resin chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would ruin the nicest bud I had
that I could fit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single bag I bought because I
thought that that was the way that was
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the older the older cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they told me to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I ruined weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, rocks full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gee, moon rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also telling them a story about how,
you know, we would get all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the glass, the pipes,
not the pipes, the bongs, the water pipes
[SPEAKER_00]: that we would get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to call them water pipes back
then, or they would throw your ass out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the store immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would have big signs that say we
only sell water pipes because water pipes
[SPEAKER_00]: could be used for tobacco and thus weren't
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where bongs were a specific nomenclature
for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could get a shop shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cops would come in and ask if I could
buy a bong just to see if the shop was
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid enough to say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they shut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, yeah, I mean, I smoked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made pipes out of tin foil using pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: To form the tin foil, I smoked out of
apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked out of, you know, cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad still tells everyone that every
every every nasty, every nasty thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: would just laugh at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But literally the very first time I saw
anybody smoke like using glass pipes was
[SPEAKER_00]: there is this guy is considered the
grandfather of modern glass pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name was Bob Snodgrass and he was a
fixture on dead tour and he would blow
[SPEAKER_00]: pipes out of the back of his van and sell
you little top hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had, you know, he was the coolest thing
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you had to literally go to a dead
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so, yeah, we would even
acquiring the method to smoke fucking weed
[SPEAKER_00]: was not very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, thank God I didn't smoke out of
too much tin foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain thanked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, screens, cleaning your screens,
ripping your screen out, holding it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: pair of needle nose and then like burning
the resin off the screen so you could
[SPEAKER_00]: reuse it with your lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all that type of stuff that was
like cutting edge technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, yeah, he missed that road
clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we had one of those,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the very first time somebody
told me that you could clean up a bong
[SPEAKER_00]: with alcohol and salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a dirty graphics plastic bong and
I got like 99% alcohol and I got some salt
[SPEAKER_00]: and I mixed them up and I poured it in the
thing and I watched the whole bong just
[SPEAKER_00]: crack all the way up slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ruined my bong because I didn't
realize that that's what would happen
[SPEAKER_00]: because plastic porous, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was so much resin that it like
inhibited the glass that when it started
[SPEAKER_00]: melting the resin, it started structurally
fucking with the pipe and I ruined my bong
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was like, oh, you know, I had to
like leave the state to go get another
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was like, oh, there goes the
bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, now head shops are easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ordering shit's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I used to take a tray,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you take your weed up here on the tray
and you angle it between your chest and
[SPEAKER_00]: your knees and you break up all of your
Mexican at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the seeds would roll down the
tray and collect in the bottom lip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to deseed and destem the
entire thing just to get smokable weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so yeah, the I mean,
I can't there was another porn store in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenosha that also sold pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that I remember is Supreme
Video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been there in decades,
but it still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it does now,
but it's certainly it's certainly that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how hard it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, even the big city like
Chicago, everything was banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to go find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to use postal scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only kind of scale you could
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck getting a digital scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was no digital scale
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nowhere that sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nowhere to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would have the little postal scale
that you with the clip and you'd put your
[SPEAKER_00]: little everybody knew that like a baggie,
a sandwich baggie was one gram and a
[SPEAKER_00]: ziplock was three and a half grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to hold it up, you know,
and the buyer and the seller would make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure because depending on the level of
compression, sometimes you'd buy brickweed
[SPEAKER_00]: and like an eighth would be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone would be like, there's no way
that weighs right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't weigh right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you'd have to be like,
oh, there's one scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no, it actually weighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that was, you know,
like a lot of people, triple beams,
[SPEAKER_00]: triple beams existed, but they were hard
to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older guys had triple beams,
you know, and with the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you move it along, do the whole big,
that was the high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could get a triple beam and you had
the money to grab that, then you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're really, then you're really
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But postal scales, honestly, as a
teenager, that's what everybody was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hideable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't hide a triple beam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, postal scales were like the
standard when I was young, just straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, rather than talking
about like your first highs or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the first state of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was weed normalcy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shut up for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt can throw in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably has a little bit better access
because Southern California, he probably
[SPEAKER_00]: got a little bit nicer green bud than I
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's shaking his head.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like my, my first experience,
like as it, as someone that went and
[SPEAKER_01]: actively bought pot, I'm not talking about
watering for dad or any of that bullshit,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I had no interest in any of that
when I was young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first got into actually actively
like going, trying to find weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first stuff I saw was, you know,
us high school fucking smoking out of
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking cans, you know, we had just gotten
into high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 13 when I entered high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when we first started buying
from, you know, the seniors that had
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking shitty ass meds, but this was all
we knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember the first time not breaking
it up at all, just throwing it on a can
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to burn it, you know,
no one really taught us any of that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how to properly break it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we saw a lot of compressed brick
coming through and traditionally most,
[SPEAKER_01]: even over all the years, the ones that I
remember the most had this minty almost
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not talking like heavy turps,
like, Whoa, this is, it just had like very
[SPEAKER_01]: low smells of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we had what we called the pretendica,
which was the uncompressed and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and usually not always, but usually it
would be more red or huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be full colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, in our area, we were doing like 60
an ounce, two 50 for a P of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the max, but at the same time,
the uncompressed was usually two 50 to 300
[SPEAKER_01]: or 60 to 70 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't a big difference in the
uncompressed versus the compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I'll just throw a little ad
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, since I'm from the Midwest,
this, we can get a little bit historical
[SPEAKER_00]: here for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, obviously they, they made,
uh, marijuana illegal in 1910.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal in 1937.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had a problem in the 1940
and that we started world war two and they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed so many supplies for clothing,
for sales, for ropes, for canvas,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, army bags, all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had this program called hemp
for victory, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in hemp for victory, they basically
paid a bunch of farmers to grow millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of acres of cannabis, uh, hemp act,
not cannabis, not drug cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hemp for fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Illinois, Kansas, Indiana, a bunch of
Midwestern states, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously if you're growing millions of
acres of seeded cannabis, uh, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a bunch of wild seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's where in the Midwest,
that's where the term ditch weed comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was wild populations of hemp
because they made hemp illegal again,
[SPEAKER_00]: right after we won the war.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for 40 from 40 to 45, they just grew
just millions of acres of hemp in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for decades after that,
they paid the government and the DEA to
[SPEAKER_00]: eradicate it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, most people don't know this,
but like 90% of the DEA's budget to
[SPEAKER_00]: eradicate cannabis was just cutting down
hemp fields in the Midwest that grew wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the way the government works,
you know, um, you know, I, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the government works is they just
take the money and use the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so ditch weed for us, which we
called pretendica was I will freely admit
[SPEAKER_00]: that multiple times I bought what I
thought were gorgeous looking ounces of
[SPEAKER_00]: premium kind of green, juicy, frosty,
everything else and paid three 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then you start smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hadn't at that point in my life,
I'd never even heard the word CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know it existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know what hemp was really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I wouldn't get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do this experiment where we'd
smoke some green Mexican and we get way
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we called it pretendica because
some entrepreneurs, scammers would go out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and they'd harvest some wild hemp
that looked gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd dry it and they'd sell it to dump
bucks, uh, that were teenagers that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know any better for top dollar thinking
they were getting the juiciest,
[SPEAKER_00]: like seven bud ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we called pretendica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because when you got cheated out of
your money and you bought weed that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work, I had no idea at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know it was CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was literally buying gorgeous
hemp, uh, but I didn't know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people are saying ditch weed,
ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indiana, Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still ditch weed, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's still ditch weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it grows wild populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seeds itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows on the edges of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows on the edges of forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows in ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, obviously it rains a lot in the
Midwest and summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't need very much care by
humans at all to propagate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska certainly has a bunch,
um, all those places where they farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you farm millions of acres of
seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's millions and millions of seeds
that hit the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it establishes a wild population
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, uh, basically,
you know, I, I've talked a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about this before, but like, uh,
when I, in the nineties, when I first got
[SPEAKER_00]: into kind bud, the two most reliable
places for me to find kind bud was Holland
[SPEAKER_00]: and a grateful bed show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it was incredibly hard to
come by there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supply of it was terribly limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand for it was super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, so that's kind of how it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I said 20, 40 for brown weed and
30, 60 for green weed, um, anything better
[SPEAKER_00]: than Mexican, no matter how crappy grown
was 50 a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have some stories of some really
messed up, very poorly grown kind bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: but didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 50, 60, 70 and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you didn't want it, somebody else
would hop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if that,
I don't know what it was like in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in where you're from that,
but that, that was, that was my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into cannabis was that was what
was around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we didn't really start seeing really
good shit, at least in our circle until
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, cause my dad went to prison for,
he was always in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wasn't really like down to hook up
his connects because he just wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was always getting out and getting
new connects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my best friend, his name was Josh
moved back from Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got sent away to Alaska for some reason
by his mom in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did something bad or gotten a car wreck
drunk or some, something crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he got shipped off to Alaska and he
comes back and he's like, like check this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He opens a saxophone case.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a bong in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is like one of the first times
I've seen a glass bong, a really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: glass bong, you know, and he breaks up
this weed and it smells crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never really seen weed like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, let me tell you about this most
potent strain on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Matt Muscavalli Thunderfuck,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and I didn't know about
name strains at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like, it was, it was all a big
mystery to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he busts out some white, what he
called white rhino and some white widow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that was our first real
experience in our circle with those kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Bakersfield is, is traditionally
hardcore MEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even now you're not getting real quality
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people that go to collectives,
you're just not seeing quality shit in
[SPEAKER_01]: Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a connoisseur market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much driven by low price in
Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's, that's the personal
experience or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to like harp too,
too long on what our own personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason to talk about it,
which just to give people a sense of when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get into weed, you know, honestly,
I'm not even sure I would have tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing as soon as I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had access to a variety of kinds of
kind bud, that's what we called it,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind bud or dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the kind of the two words that
we used for it commonly was, and I'll add
[SPEAKER_00]: one more piece to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I actually did meet some crews
that had weed, so this is the funny part,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say, let's say that you're like
three people away from a grower and this
[SPEAKER_00]: grower is growing like three or four or
five pounds or something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who bought all the stuff that the
guy wasn't going to keep her personal,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say the group guy grew five pounds
and he sold four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude that would buy the four pounds
would take the four pounds and he would
[SPEAKER_00]: dump them out on the table and whatever he
was going to keep, he would pick nub by
[SPEAKER_00]: nub the nicest looking shit out of the
whole thing because every bit of it sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might have only been like three
people away from the grower and every bud
[SPEAKER_00]: I got in the half ounces I was buying was
that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was no, like everybody could
just skim every person that got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just skim the amount they were
keeping, every nice bud because everything
[SPEAKER_00]: would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter, which is ridiculous
today that like you could essentially sell
[SPEAKER_00]: smalls at a premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the first thing the first
time I heard the word dank was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: dead shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the kind of a kind bud or dank
was the way that you describe shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't Mexican, at least in my little
circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember my first experience with
it was my friend's Adam, my friend Adam's
[SPEAKER_01]: older brother, Dave, he came home wearing
a shirt that said dank on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I was like, what does that
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, it means it's not fucking swag,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what the fuck is swag,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what is, what is, what is swag?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, there was this thing
where, I mean, you know, being frank with
[SPEAKER_00]: people, like when you first get kind bud,
like you didn't even know it existed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a situation where you
already like weed, you're into smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: brown weed, you're into smoking the green
weed, you like weed, you like getting
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does all the different things to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get some kind bud and like
you didn't even realize that that grade
[SPEAKER_00]: existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't any seeds, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the first kind bud I saw too was
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from the Midwest, there was no
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dirt weed, swag, you know,
you'd cut it with, sometimes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks, you'd cut it with a bread knife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, oh yeah, easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd saw it with a serrated knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you'd sit there and saw it and break
it up and fluff it and try to figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I mean, my friends and
I, like, we could go to dead shows and we
[SPEAKER_00]: could get weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was one of the, it wasn't the
primary reason that we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's funny, I didn't
have anything, like my parents weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could say I'm first gen as far
as like my family getting involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when I first went to a dead
show, my buddy and I were trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out where we could like sit down and hide
and smoke some weed where none of the
[SPEAKER_00]: adults were going to rat us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because back then it was like,
you know, 15 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't let an adult see you smoking
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my grandma and mom were not fucking
cool at all with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes back to the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to get popped every time and I'd
never figured out how my grandma always
[SPEAKER_01]: popped me when I was smoking because she
would fucking always catch me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later on, she told me it was because
when I would smoke bowls in my room,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds would get hot and pop out and
burned holes in the carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time there was new holes in the
carpet, she knew I was in there fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, we definitely we definitely got
taught young to remove seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly certainly, you know,
certainly you don't always do it the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You miss one, especially if you can't get
them on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, there's like this
paper thin seed shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the hard shell, but there's like a
kind of a papery like on a garlic clove or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually what stripes are on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd that thin paper sleeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you'd miss that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then that would taste
terrible if you got that in your bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, oh, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, I mean, yeah, my actually
my first growing was flicking seeds out my
[SPEAKER_00]: window, you know, getting some stuff so I
could go on a walk and smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd be like mowing my out,
you know, my lawn for spring in the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, oh, you know,
and I would just run right over it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the mower because I was like, I didn't
even think that that would happen at
[SPEAKER_01]: Ridgeview at Ridgeview or high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who went there between ninety four
and ninety nine knew about the weed patch
[SPEAKER_01]: we had growing across the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it pretty much everybody was in on
taking care of these plants as long as we
[SPEAKER_01]: could do it, you know, until the Narts
came out and figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, like for, you know,
the so that's that's just kind of to set
[SPEAKER_00]: the tone of like that's kind of what the
90s was like, you know, in the in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early and mid 90s, there was basically no
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't very good access.
[SPEAKER_00]: The education sucked, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we that's what started my
trips to Amsterdam was was I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I they have good weed over there and I
don't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, it was like you would
meet people on dead tour that could give
[SPEAKER_00]: you weed because lots of people would
bring pounds to dead tour and sell eighths
[SPEAKER_00]: and quarters and ounces just to like,
you know, do their two, three week run
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, that's essentially how,
you know, I mean, that's what Pibod and
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Brand were doing when when Chem Dog
bought his sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just, you know, people would
bring good weed to dead shows and hustle
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe that maybe that we
could talk about that a little bit because
[SPEAKER_00]: now it's like it's pretty widely spread
throughout different parts of society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different there's certainly
lots of different types of people growing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably always was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the 90s, it was a hippie based
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the people that were most in tune
with weed, the people that were most in
[SPEAKER_00]: tune with getting weed and bringing weed,
you know, dead dead shows were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the greatest open air weed markets
that's ever existed in America because
[SPEAKER_00]: people from all walks of life,
all parts of the country, New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, California, wherever they would
buy or bring their weed on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they would fund their
party, their food, their hotels,
[SPEAKER_00]: their traveling, their tickets,
their whatever, you know, most people that
[SPEAKER_00]: went to dead shows, not everyone,
but most people went to dead show smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really easy to sell weed and get
by and it wasn't nearly as sketchy as some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other substances and stuff that
people hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed was a little mellower, you know,
so yeah, lots of people did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's some there's some
pretty famous stuff that used to get sold
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could chat about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy, who, you know, we talked about
him before, Staten Island, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he, you know, he's about seven years
older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he and Skunk VA used to go to a
bunch of dead shows together with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they his favorite weed on
dead tour was Big Sur Holy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said you could buy Big Sur Holy
Skunk and you could buy Big Sur Holy Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you know, a lot of people had
like fanny packs back then of all things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said that like it was so
distinctive of an aroma that not only
[SPEAKER_00]: could you tell somebody had dank weed in
their fanny pack, you could tell that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were holding on to the Big Sur Holy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so out of everything that he had back
then, everything he had access to that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, whoever was doing it was bringing
it, you know, chunks of it regularly to
[SPEAKER_00]: dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the stuff that we talked
about, the Super Skunk, the MSS,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people called that the, you know,
the Skunk 6 on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Skunk on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Northern Lights on tour,
you know, and a lot of people that went to
[SPEAKER_00]: dead shows grew weed or sold weed or knew
people that grew weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my education about weed was basically I
could go to dead shows, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could learn that in retrospect,
a lot of ignorance around my area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I could go to dead shows and I could
learn from some old timers or I could go
[SPEAKER_00]: to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I could and I could learn
from cats over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I met I met a guy,
some people call him Mr. Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a guy named Steve in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Simon from Sirius, who was super
nice to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met some other folks just like anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you go some coffee shops,
you know, coffee shops are kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have the kind all that
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some decent stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have some really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you get started getting into
like the collector circles and you make
[SPEAKER_00]: some acquaintances and friends,
you know, that kind of stuff, you start
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting and getting some better weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you know, yeah, there was,
you know, yeah, they're like, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's dead shows were dead shows were
the best place for because you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize to without the Internet,
without forums, without trading,
[SPEAKER_00]: without any of that, with everything being
illegal everywhere and everything being
[SPEAKER_00]: super clandestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, little circles might get this,
but or that, but in their local area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you know, the the modern
Big Sur stuff, I can tell you that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly the mix, but I can
say that some of the Big Sur stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staten Island has confirmed did smell very
similar to we went over to Amsterdam in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 90s and we smelled the sage,
the actual like famous cutting of sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran over there and he confirmed that
it did smell like the Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the versions of the Big Sur that
he used to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't say, you know, there's a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, our buddy Bodie has a cut
that he uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI has a cut that's a little turpentine
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's some people in Colorado
and other areas that has that has,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the the atom cut of sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really my my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say which ones are more legit than
others, you know, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm sure it exists out there in
various forms, you know, so that was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that was the first place I saw
blueberry was on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first place I saw northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first place I saw skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first place I saw lots of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt wasn't really into dead shows,
so he doesn't really share that
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I do, I will say I have I
mean, back then we were we were punk
[SPEAKER_01]: rockers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in in our scene, it wasn't a weed
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a heroin scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a meth scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was it killed everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't we didn't have a big weed scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really have the respect for
the dead or the dead scene for that matter
[SPEAKER_01]: during those times, because they were just
long hairs to us, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I've gotten older and I'm more
passionate about about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've realized how much how much really
went on in our scene and revolved around
[SPEAKER_01]: the dead shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, making it from point A to point
B, it's such a major, major part of our
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it was it was a serious loss not
to to really open my eyes to that early
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's one of those things
where it's like it was kind of by default.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was I mean, some of the
things, you know, sometimes people ask me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how did you get access to all
these famous strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in honesty, like when I got when I got
a bunch of them, they weren't famous at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was years before any of them would
become famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't like I got anything that I
was like, oh, my God, this is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just this weed,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hippies and dead and people that
attended dead shows a bunch, they traded
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, honestly, when I moved out to
Mendocino, it was because I had friends
[SPEAKER_00]: from Dead Tour that lived outside of U.K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had an inn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had I had a person that knew people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a person that could get me situated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have me, you know, I can get
situated with for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's all kinds of people involved
in and it's grown much beyond it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the 90s, I don't think there was
any social group that had more access to
[SPEAKER_00]: more different kinds of stuff than than
hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because being on Dead Tour, you'd have
friends from Miami and upstate New York
[SPEAKER_00]: and Montana and Texas and Florida and
Alaska and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they would just you would gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was spring, summer and fall tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're traveling with people, you're
partying with people, you're smoking weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trading stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the way that things blended,
for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sort of the first forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proto forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was dead shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was where like minded people could
gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, so, you know,
I know, you know, they say that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: people that I'm looking at stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are saying the cut didn't come from
Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it didn't come from Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: His partner is actually who brought it to
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they brought it in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the Big Sur Holy because it
was grown in the back of a monastery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the holy weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harry the Monk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, I don't I don't have
I don't really have any like specific ties
[SPEAKER_00]: to that except for, you know, except for
like one of my old friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of his.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would tell these stories of it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a few different Big Sur holy lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had one that came from Indian guy or and
it wasn't his creation or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was he he got a lot of seeds from
people and he would distribute them so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we didn't really know the sourcing on
a lot of this stuff from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it came through him and it was a pink
pistol version that was supposedly the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple, which is in supposedly in Big Sur
Holy Weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people refer to it as Zacatecas
purple because Zacatecas is easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: pronounce than Zebra.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what is also the Danbo version,
which I believe is Big Sur Holy Weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: Reefer Man's version and Bodhi had a
version.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that I noticed runs in
common with a lot of these lines was the
[SPEAKER_01]: trip in a lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I'm not from that area,
I don't know if that is a common trait
[SPEAKER_01]: with the original Big Sur Holy,
but that is what ran in between all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for sure that and I honestly don't
remember, but we did, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Staten Island myself got some sacks
from the Adam and the THC crew in the
[SPEAKER_00]: midnight in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did say that it smelled like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a strong memory of what it
smelled like, so I can't comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI uses is a bit turpentine based.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say that for sure, because I've
huffed that in recent years and such and
[SPEAKER_00]: have some experience with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think I've ever personally
smoked any of Bodhi's pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly have smoked some hybrids,
but I don't have a memory of Bodhi's
[SPEAKER_00]: either, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what's funny,
too, is like, you know, the other thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that people should know is like,
you know, CSI and Bodhi are both
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonably good friends of ours,
you'd classify it as.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of breeders and stuff,
they they use their strains to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the collection,
I might have known you forever and you
[SPEAKER_00]: might.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that you're
producing smokeable weed of all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: pure lines all the time, where your
friends can have sacks of them either.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times the stuff you're trying
is hybrids or s ones or this or that or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these guys aren't growing a bunch
of pure, you know, females to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're using them in breeding work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it goes back to that whole
statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If some plants are growers and some plants
are breeders and sometimes they that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: mutually exclusive, you know, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe this would be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that Matt and I chatted
about that I think is kind of it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can throw this in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were talking to the on the
Correll interview, one of the cool things
[SPEAKER_00]: was to me was hearing, you know,
how they came up with the nickname Victor
[SPEAKER_00]: Barn and how they came up with Beatrix
Joyce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Victor Barn was like the code name that
the royal put on his bank account to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the kickback skim that he wasn't
going to be traced to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Beatrix was the queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of that kind of ties in to
like cannabis for a long time has always
[SPEAKER_00]: had like we've had this we've had this
nickname game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of subversive in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, a lot of nicknames about pop
culture, you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use we give various nicknames to
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little crew gets it and it becomes,
you know, you throw a nickname on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you a couple examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legend of the puck is that the guy
that everybody got it from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he used to carry it around in a in a hot
tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hockey puck case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like the some people might
remember bubble tape that bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it looks about that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally is a case that holds a puck,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so they called it the puck because
it came out of the case.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, we I have the dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Minneapolis, it was called electric
boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the snow bud was called Skunk
Five in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Chem Dog has been called Chem
Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it just straight dog for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it got called Skunk BA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it got called Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these certain strains have names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them tie into various things,
you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Matt and I and others,
it makes it a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're trying to find out,
like, is this NL five by Skunk One?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they didn't keep the real name that
they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't keep the lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nickname.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we put a lot of time and energy and
research into finding out like what the
[SPEAKER_00]: real names are.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second before you get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have the top voted question is in a
previous episode, you guys spoke about NL
[SPEAKER_01]: two possibly being renamed to Hindu Kush
since he acquired Neville Stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go ahead and talk about that
part?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a there's a there's a couple of
things there that we could that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, real quick, just Hindu Kush is a
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Sam Skunkman, Dave Watson,
he brought a Hindu Kush that was not
[SPEAKER_00]: related over to Amsterdam as well at some
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of things have been called Hindu
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in specific, this the Sensi thing,
if you look back in Neville's catalog,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically every time he talks about NL
two, he were in every description from the
[SPEAKER_00]: 86 catalog on he calls it a Hindu Kush
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps describing it as a Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were things that, you know,
he called what he called Skunk Kush was NL
[SPEAKER_00]: two by Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he kept every every basically
every reference you can find to NL two and
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the seed bank catalogs he calls
Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when Sensi took over,
they renamed a number of his things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spoke about this before,
but they they renamed it NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the clues was they also sold
Skunk Kush and they called it our best
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindu Kush phenotype crossed with Skunk
One.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but you look in Neville's
catalog and Skunk Kush is NL two by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so and so Sensi just changed
every reference to NL two to Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's they even use if you look
in the verbiage of Neville's description
[SPEAKER_00]: of NL two and his 88, 89 and 90 catalog,
they even use similar words, same words
[SPEAKER_00]: and similar verbiage and similar
sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville had some very long winded
descriptions of his weed paragraphs like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensi would would would shrink them down
to two or three sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty clear we've documented in
a variety of ways they what what if you
[SPEAKER_00]: bought Hindu Kush from Sensi seeds,
it was NL two F three that was sold by
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville the last three years of the seed
bank catalog and everything that they had
[SPEAKER_00]: that said NL two NL two just disappears
off the face of the earth with the
[SPEAKER_00]: exception that Dutch Passion released an
NL two phenome that they called Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that makes it tough
is that there's so many nicknames given to
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that you try to trace back what it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we talked about before,
most of the stuff that was that was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: was either from SSSC or the seed bank or
Sensi because that was the only games that
[SPEAKER_00]: were selling international seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of their genetics are absolutely
laced through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The our scene, but they go by different
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you piece together,
you know, on, for instance, I'll give you
[SPEAKER_00]: an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've I've always thought that the dog
shit or I like to call it the electric
[SPEAKER_00]: boogaloo, because I think electric
boogaloo is one of the all time coolest
[SPEAKER_00]: names in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so change against the dog shit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely today in modern cannabis,
where everything has to be candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evoke images and be deserty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's zero chance that anybody would
name anything dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be about as much chance of dog
shit being a name as like filthy sweatsaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wouldn't come about, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've always felt that it was in an NL
five haze phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cat piss would be very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you not that and Matt
and I have issues with phylose,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you go and you look at phylose,
OK, some of the things that that dog shit
[SPEAKER_00]: is supposedly fairly closely related to is
European NL five haze phenotes that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been, you know, and so we've always we've
always had this idea that it was that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to trace it by it was
called this in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called this in Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was it before Minneapolis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phylosis isn't very good at showing family
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only show them if they're really
close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it shows relationships to PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows relationships to C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows relationships to A5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows relationships to hash plant haze
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably because it's an NL
five haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you try to get you try to get
various stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these cool nicknames,
you know, and some of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know the Cindy 99 story,
supposedly he found seeds and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: laughing, but supposedly he found seeds in
a bud of Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that at least gives you an indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it was just Cindy 99 and you don't
know that backstory part, what is
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinderella 99?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the origin?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what is the and then it might
have one nickname in one group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, we have some friends on
our discord server and they get into
[SPEAKER_00]: battles over it because, you know,
the puck, the puck was called the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people called it Skelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some older people say bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever called it Skelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no one ever called it this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was never that, you know,
but different groups get it and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: different nicknames.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what group you get it from or
what group you hear about it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nickname that I can I can tell
everyone that in my crew, everybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: had the chem dog, we called the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it wasn't chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shortened the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these new names didn't really pop up
until oh six.
[SPEAKER_00]: When our when our buddy skunk VA got on
the forums, and people were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what the fuck he was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they started calling it the skunk
VA cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think Canada actually
named it like Canada, the health,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever their cannabis board is their
that makes it legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have a strain called skunk
VA because they confused it so much and
[SPEAKER_01]: confabulated it so much they were trying
to name it after chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they only named it skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to know what skunk VA thinks about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and it was and so the only
reason why I bring that up is just is is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just because it just shows you
the progressions of different names that
[SPEAKER_00]: different small groups of cannabis smokers
can give to a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you get that strain through
their crew, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, another example would be,
you know, we talked about this in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first episode that I participated in was
about how my buddy from Staten Island went
[SPEAKER_00]: to Virginia to get the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he dropped it off with chem dog when
he got the dog in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he drove the skunk and the chem
dog west, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a whole bunch of people that
call it the MSS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Massachusetts super skunk,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they heard about it or they saw it
or they knew about it from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was from Virginia, but they
didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people called that the
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we always called it in our
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was other people that took it to
Colorado that was tied into the same
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called it by the name on the tag,
the you know, the number of the seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was six.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people called it skunk six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people called it Massachusetts super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people called it super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some people only briefly called it
MSS super skunk because what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: realized if there is another cut called
MSS super skunk proliferating at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time from the same crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't even realize that for years
and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pieced together fairly recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, is that if you were from
Virginia, you called it one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were from Massachusetts or New
York, and you got it from that crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: you like to call it another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were from my crew in Northern
California, you called it a different
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was only recently that we
started figuring, you know, we were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, through various friends and
stuff, start talking to the person who
[SPEAKER_00]: bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, get actual information on
what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the point that I was trying to make
there and that was kind of long winded is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, we add nicknames and those
nicknames are cool and neat and funny and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you go to try to figure out
the lineage of stuff, you hit a wall a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the time from nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what it is because it got
named dumpster or electric boogaloo or
[SPEAKER_00]: snow or, you know, or whatever it might
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Trinity was named Trinity
because it came out of a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bud that a friend gave someone that came
from Trinity, Trinity County in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody, you know, we do more with SSSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite possible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you, if you want your questions
to be a part of like the giveaway and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, though, put it in that little
question section.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it easier for us to read and
catch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we won't miss it as much and you'll
be entered in the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so the name game happened
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: For different reasons in America,
it was mostly in the, in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was mostly just crews giving cultural
names to stuff in Holland and other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was to hide the lineage that they got
it from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they would change the name a
little bit sometimes and hide that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's common now in America too.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, people like to hide exactly where
they got, what they got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can't be, you can't create
something magical.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone else created it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, I mean, that's, that's,
so that's the funny part, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really what it boils down to is
that, you know, and we can talk about this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff too, is like, you know,
they, everybody, everybody gets to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: or whoever wants to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get seeds and you get clones
and you get whatever from your crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From your connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start with whatever that was,
was there is nobody out there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is collecting random mass land race
strains on their own travels for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, breeding them and bringing totally
unique things that no one else except for
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers in those regions had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets what they get from their
friends and their crew, who they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they start breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not a diss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to act like in today's
world, breeders have to come out with some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of totally unique genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not just standing on the
shoulders of everybody that came before
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a bunch of preposterous crap.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it from, you know, uh,
you know, I mean, we could talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you could talk about, you know,
there's some famous strains from down by
[SPEAKER_00]: you, Matt, that you had access to like,
um, bull rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, see bull rider was one of the few
that I didn't have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get access to bull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hog's breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hog's breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that doesn't give you very good
clues about what the hell's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Betsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hog's breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: P91.
[SPEAKER_00]: P91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not helpful terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just barely being able to pick apart
what's in P91 by its growth expressions
[SPEAKER_01]: and running through enough S1s and S2s to
see what its parentage is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just barely getting a shot at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of these things are
just, so they were cool at the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were pop culture or they were
culturally related or they were an inside
[SPEAKER_00]: joke in the crew or something like that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, then you know,
it's, uh, you know, that's just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it was, but it makes it much more
difficult now because a lot of these clone
[SPEAKER_00]: only elites, um, had these nicknames.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And figuring out what they actually are is
tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because, you know, it would be
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if, if technology was different,
imagine if SSSC and Neville and Sensi and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sirius and these different groups had been
able to put up all of their original cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: into something like Philos or into some,
something better than Philos, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_00]: or some kind of genetic marker group where
you could see the family tree now has
[SPEAKER_00]: exploded from all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the names have obscured just how
much we depended on all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, well, yeah, I mean,
someone says, I thought the P91 was a NL
[SPEAKER_00]: cubed project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the many, many stories
going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's many, there's so many about
P91 that it's silverback tie across the
[SPEAKER_01]: something else that it's silver pearl,
that it's early pearl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it looks, it looks super skunk based
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when we were also talking
to Correll, it was, it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to see back then that like,
you know, he got stuff from various
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but a lot of his work came from bag
seeds of wheat he liked from coffee shops.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, obviously we've,
we, you know, we, uh, we've covered it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but chem dog is a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sour diesel is a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies is a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity is a bag seed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, OG was bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can go on and on and on and on and
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently Runts was too, you know,
like it just, it's never going to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of, a bunch of the most famous
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is you find some seed and a bud you like
and something pops out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people are like, Oh, you know,
I mean, even with me and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: like old cuts and people are like,
Oh, what about the Maui?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the, that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the reason why we call it the Maui is
because that's where we, it was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was too dumb to ask any other
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the time it wasn't like,
you know, there wasn't this like enormous
[SPEAKER_00]: thirst for specific lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just want a good week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's part of the problem too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you start interviewing some of
these people, uh, you know, when,
[SPEAKER_00]: when Matt got to interview, uh,
you know, Seattle Greg or that interview
[SPEAKER_00]: that we just did, you know, you're like,
okay, what exactly was, was this,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was Beatrix choice?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the, give me the rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the, how did you, and they were
like, Oh, you know, I took this good weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had this good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was this buddy over here
that had weed from New York and we mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: those all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we called it that because it was a fun
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, well, that's where
that trail ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you're not going to get the
specifics of some of the stuff and not,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this huge desire to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but a lot of the lineage, I mean,
we should be blessed that we know what we
[SPEAKER_00]: know and new information still bubbles up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and you know, what's funny,
like I've never remembered the disclaimer
[SPEAKER_01]: to run that at the beginning, but I want
to go ahead and say, here and not so set
[SPEAKER_01]: it a few times in the middle of comments
and stuff, but the history we're bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: you is, is the best that we know it
currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things change all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People come out of the word works.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually honest, you know,
with some of these old lines and can
[SPEAKER_01]: enlighten us on some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you guys are watching these
episodes and stuff, do your own research,
[SPEAKER_01]: go out there, kick, kick dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're wrong, let us know, you know,
we're trying to bring you the best
[SPEAKER_01]: information as we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not catching me in anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, you're totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can prove it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear something that
clarifies something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this stuff is our best guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when we present information,
we try to get it corroborated from
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that was one of the really important
parts actually of the interview that we
[SPEAKER_00]: just did was there's kind of been this
battle between Sam and Neville over
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what happened and then getting,
uh, Carell's, you know, opinion on what he
[SPEAKER_00]: got from, from Sam as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the timeframe that he got it in,
you start getting little pieces that add
[SPEAKER_00]: in and it backs up one story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it's totally right,
but you know, that's, that's what you do
[SPEAKER_00]: with evidence is you're trying to gather
up evidence and give your best guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, sometimes people disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do when, when, you know,
three people are involved in the making of
[SPEAKER_00]: something and two of them don't agree with
the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people try to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, which person do I think lies less?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or lies about what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe their memory is just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, that could be it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people are like, oh, you said
something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a lie, but sometimes it's
just people have different memories of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so, and a lot of this stuff,
you know, uh, we, we had a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we had a big chat with,
uh, with Caleb, um, about breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: goals and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we chatted about how difficult it is
to actually breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the things that's so
crazy about bag seeds or accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinations is sometimes they're better
than some humans best effort, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's really humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, Neville said that all the F
ones he made of Hayes, he liked more than
[SPEAKER_00]: all the poly hybrids he made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept trying to get stuff that was as
good or better and he kept failing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of stuff, you know,
some of the, I think some of the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why some of these 90 cuts still rule the
game, like sour diesels and, and cushions
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of these, a lot of these old cuts
that are still blended into things is
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were just like two raw things
that weren't like each other accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: combined.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the real things in
breeding that makes a big difference is if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can cross things that are really
dissimilar to each other, you tend to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a hard time to sit there and be
like, oh, I'm going to take, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush mints and I'm going to cross it by
cherry pie by Kush, you know, or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, it's, it's pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Neville found that a lot of the
pure Afghans didn't like each other at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you know, so you take,
you take two totally different random
[SPEAKER_00]: things from two different gene pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of why I like,
I am, I'm a nineties guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've, I've said a bunch of times that
I think the nineties is my favorite area,
[SPEAKER_00]: era of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, the reason why I think
that is that that was sort of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: poly hybrid era, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the things before that were like
simple crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people started taking simple
cross two F ones and crossing them
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a lot of times that raw work was
really good, you know, so the AK 47,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the bubble gum, the Cali mess,
the Western winds, a bunch of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that Neville was doing, the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing about it is,
is because weed was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We was so rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was good, it all sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to keep a bunch of diverse
weed alive is if it all sells super easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst thing, one of the worst things
that's happened to cannabis is these,
[SPEAKER_00]: this named this name strain game,
where these different waves of purples or
[SPEAKER_00]: sours or cookies or cookies or Skittles or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it a bunch of times before,
but, um, every time that's the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's easy to sell and get top dollar,
a whole bunch of diversity is just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get put by the wayside because people,
people are like, this is hard to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't hard to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the nineties, if it was good bud,
it was easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which meant that every kind of good bud
imaginable survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it all work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really important for
people to understand is that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you want all this diversity
to survive, you have to support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a, it's a customer driven
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, I think that that's very
little understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I talked about that with my buddy
Manic quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other day, it's a very customer
driven market and what the customer wants
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, they want, uh, the new,
the shiny, uh, what's hype, what's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they want variety so they can
select from a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The opposite of what breeding brings,
you know, like you bring brings
[SPEAKER_01]: uniformity, working lines, you know,
there's a thousand reasons why it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: customer driven market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if things are ever to change,
there has to be that, that want from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, community to, to allow people to work
lines for six, you know, five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six years to actually work a line and not,
and because it's not hype, it won't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's a hard, it's a,
it's a catch 22 for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's, you know,
there's, I mean, it's kind of funny in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, but I mean, I know we know people
that one of the ways that they got a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of old strains that they have is they had
five or six rare hype cuts and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: find old growers that had something that
they were really excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy was like, Oh my God,
I'm having a hard time selling my herb,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and maybe like, well,
you know, I can give you this blue cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll get top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been so pumped, you know,
to get it, you know, and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and because people, I mean, you know,
the name of the game, uh, you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to find something that moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to find something that,
unless you're growing strictly on a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal basis and there's zero financial
incentive in it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you have to give customers what they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that, you know,
we're not going to talk about breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: very much on this episode, you know,
but one of the aspects is like for
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity sake is that it's hard to grow
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to take a risk, um, when the public
might not like it very much, which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: right now people are like, okay,
well, how many different ways can I cross
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles, cookies, and Kush and find
something new?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, is that since that's
been done like crazy for the last 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_00]: or 14 years or whatever, people keep
hoping that they're going to try slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different variations of the same cuts
combined and pop something massively new
[SPEAKER_00]: and exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but they're really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now everything looks like gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, it's just, but for that
thing too, it's like, it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just, there's only so many things
you're going to get out of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations of traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you keep going from bag seed to bag
seed to bag seed to bag seed, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting in a single direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you're selecting a single
direction or a narrowing gene pool
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the more it goes to that,
the more you're going to see things look
[SPEAKER_01]: all the same, have similar turps,
similar highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a new top question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we want to do,
there's some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the top one right now is, I know Natsos
talked briefly about his headband cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here's my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which headband of his cuts did CSI use for
his fem crosses with the D and the TK?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could talk a little bit about the
different cuts of headband he has and how
[SPEAKER_00]: long he's had each one, a little
background on where each cut came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, which one of those cuts was
used in the two crosses by CSI?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently those have gotten real
popular, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, CSI is way more prolific
than I am in terms of accessible stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave him what I call my LA cut,
which I've talked about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that cut in the very early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot was trying to change what he
was up to and was thinking about starting
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed company and starting breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I gave him a whole bunch of my
super dog crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him my sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him my super skunk and a couple
other cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some rumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him the Mally or the Mendo P or the
Tem Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me the LA cut, which is the
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first headband cut I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe explain a little bit of the reason
why White has two names in your group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's caused a lot of confusion in
the headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically like it's a terrible
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I got it, you have to realize when
I got it in 01, or so, the Kush craze had
[SPEAKER_00]: not hit yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really had Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a friend that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few houses in LA that were
running it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to President Long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few crews in LA that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few places in Florida that had
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really knew about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The craze hadn't hit yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was still four or five years away
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: When would you say, you're from Southern
California, Matt, when would you say the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush craze really hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: The rage came like 2006, 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2008, it was in everybody's hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: By 2008, people started collecting rare OG
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to realize when I got this cut,
it was LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which now, I can't tell you how many times
people have been like, bro, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want me to show you what real Kush
is, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to realize that in 01-ish or
whatever, nobody had really seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush hadn't snuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a couple people that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still super tightly held.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, it's a headband,
Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go look, I have screenshots and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot wrote some essays and stuff for
Humboldt Seed Organization and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he always talks about LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in parentheses, he puts headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who named headband headband is unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unknown, totally unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what's in headband is unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to believe it's a chem dog super
skunk hybrid of some type.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that's all that's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has so many similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly a diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a diesel family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we used to sell it as sour for
the longest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever called me out and said it
wasn't sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when when Mean Gene got it in my
in my community way back when and he used
[SPEAKER_00]: it as the final stage and making his root
beer, which has become world famous in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last little bit, all the rage,
he got it as sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people would just call it that
because that's what the buyers wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when he lost it,
he kept trying to get sours and none of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sours he got were it because it wasn't
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he didn't even realize what cut
it was until a while ago, I showed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cracked him a jar and he was like,
Oh my god, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cut, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what it boils down to is that
there's two names for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush and headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush is vastly confusing because of the
Cush craze that hit and the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like 58 different Cush cuts that
came out of Southern California within
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the headband, most people don't have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they confuse it with Lupa headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: They confuse it with the Bay Area
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know, well, is it different
than the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, what are some of the other names,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there's there's all
these different names and they all get
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have crazy lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I just called the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: for like it's what I put on all the tags
on it, for lack of a better way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, back then it was by far the
first headband I'd seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't see Cush until I believe the
first time I actually got a plant of O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the flow rider in O4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was years before I saw anything that
became known as Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next headband cut, I saw some people
called the 56 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story is is not the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really like to tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but basically, let's put it real
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some violence in the Cush crew
down in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people took this cut and fled to the
bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were hiding out in the bay and they didn't
want any drama to follow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had this cut, but they didn't and
they wanted to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to call it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they they decided to name it the
headband to throw people off the trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point, a few years after
that, maybe it was five or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave out a mislabeled trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling a tray of cuts to a
buddy and they gave him a tray of this
[SPEAKER_00]: headband cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of instead of the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it slipped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see, there's a there's a old
friend of mine who runs a lot of chem
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes by I see, you know, I see,
I see collective on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headband cut that he runs is that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Bob Hemphill got that cut around that
same time from that same group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the headband cut that he has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the mad elite has really.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mad elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm just saying like different,
different groups see me running headbands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll mention this because we are going
to release a headband loop on it through
[SPEAKER_01]: greater syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are looking out for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the 56 headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in our group, it's we have headband by
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always call that not those headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the 56 headband that I
think most of us refer to as headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that that came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it in about those 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very Cush like it's one of the most
potent cuts I hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really, really great cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're talking about the 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, actually, to be honest,
both cuts, I would put both the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 56 in my top five potency of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're really, really both high,
high quality strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever the headband, the 56 was
called before, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not a headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was renamed a headband to literally
throw off the trail of whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to clarify, we don't know who named
headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could have been the first use of the
name headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because I got the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: cut in 01 and he said it was a headband,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think they renamed it until
the mid 2000 like 2004 or five or six or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't it didn't slip out in the
bay until around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could ask your buddy,
Matt, elite when he got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a crew that got it in that same
general time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super nice cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other famous one is the Loompa,
which is an O.G., which is which is
[SPEAKER_00]: another like Kush type, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's pretty sensitive about it,
you know, but it seems like it popped up
[SPEAKER_00]: on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first place we can trace back him
mentioning it is about oh, wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: late 08, early 09.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: predates that by about eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It predates the 56 by about four or five
years as far as having the headband name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's other things thrown out
like day wrecker and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't trace the day wrecker lineage
very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't trace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, to answer to final the
guy's question, the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave to CSI specifically because I
wanted my main goal with breeding is to
[SPEAKER_00]: get better weed into people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew he would throw it in various
rooms and release hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe the first two hybrids he's
released of it are the TK and the D.
[SPEAKER_00]: D, TK and L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: are some of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have high hopes that those things
will combine well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially have high hopes for the D,
which for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the headband cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story of the three main ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some guys in New York that say
they have a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other people that say they
have this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headband is absolutely one of the most
mysterious names in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lineage is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who named it is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that I have the first one,
but I have the first one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: encountered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does seem it does seem like those
other two popped up years after for lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of a lack of a better term.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another question that got a bunch
of votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose Durban poison is the official
version Mel or Sam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I can answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when Correll stated the Durban was
imported, wouldn't that make DP comparable
[SPEAKER_00]: to Mexican brick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you know, we chatted about
this at the end of the last interview,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Mel Frank in either 1978 or 79,
he gave Sam Skunkman both the Afghani one
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Durban poison that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sam traded him some sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam then later on in 84, 85, when he went
to Amsterdam, he brought Mel Frank's
[SPEAKER_00]: version of Durban poison to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank had some terrible accidents and
he lost, I believe, all of his original
[SPEAKER_00]: seed collection sometime in 83 or 84 as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought for a long time that Mel
Frank's version was the only Durban poison
[SPEAKER_00]: in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, everybody's Durban poison
must be a derivative of what Sam brought
[SPEAKER_00]: from Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in the Correll interview,
we find out that that was totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was an actual coffee shop named
Durban poison that sold South African
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got all their Durban poison from
bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they bought from the coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really widens the Durban poison
gene pool, you know, and where people got
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people got Durban poison from SSSC,
it was probably it was from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they got it from Neville, it was
probably Mel's version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to say other other seed
banks carried Durban poison other than
[SPEAKER_00]: those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really know right at this
particular moment what their sourcing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if there's an official
Durban poison and the version that Mel is
[SPEAKER_00]: selling or that Mel is selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe it's Todd or somebody like that
is selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all claimed to be original or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, Mel said that he lost his
collection in the 80s, early 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would have to be stuff that they got
back from Amsterdam from someone at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was from Sam Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's reproduction Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sold back to Todd or somebody else or
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who made Blue Dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the running theory is bluegrass seeds,
blue hen, which was the very first super
[SPEAKER_01]: silver haze blueberry cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the SC cut that we were all growing
back in the day, the very first iteration
[SPEAKER_01]: of Blue Dream, was very much a super
silver haze DJ blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the most conclusive I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, the old photo in the Canna Bible is
a picture of the Blue Dream SC cut under
[SPEAKER_01]: blue hen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jason Keene got a lot of stuff right
about that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I've heard rumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to say.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people laugh at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's grown right and it's not,
you know, people laugh at it because there
[SPEAKER_00]: were so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people grew seven to ten pound
Blue Dreams and flooded the market with
[SPEAKER_00]: huge Blue Dream stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you grow it and it only gives
you four, five, six ounces, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was also the mass influx of when
Blue Dream got popular, Spanish seed banks
[SPEAKER_01]: kicking out a bunch of blueberry haze
crosses labeled Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: companies sold Blue Dream seeds in mass,
which really, really ruined the market for
[SPEAKER_01]: that actual cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that cut is almost impossible to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see lots of stuff that looks like it,
but doesn't smell like it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you guys able to find out any more
info about the haze A and C females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, except for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a group of haze collectors in
Holland that have various ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: have various old hybrids and cuts,
and they call them different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some different names to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first part of the interview with
Matt, when he said he had he see my job
[SPEAKER_00]: out hit the floor because I thought he had
the male we used all famously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was confirmation that that that
he had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going to use it and all this
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it turns out that they're two
different females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs some more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Matt and I right now can
speak definitively to exactly what those
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hope would be that there's some
kind of hybrid that we didn't realize
[SPEAKER_00]: existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the that would be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone was asking about sacred seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, and I mentioned this earlier when
someone asked if we were going to have Sam
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made an offer for him to come on the
podcast just to talk about history.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bias.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't very receptive, but hopefully in
the future he changes his mind because
[SPEAKER_01]: he's a very important character in all
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what exactly makes a real skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, obviously, if it if anything that
comes out that smells extremely skunky,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could call skunk and two would be
that's the name that that Robin and Sam
[SPEAKER_00]: gave to this hybrid hybrid of Colombian,
Mexican and Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the phenos that come out of
that would be real skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that smell like skunk the ones
that smell like grape, the one that smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always I never call it skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only call it skunk one just to never
divide the two or to never confabulate the
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it just goes to show that,
you know, you can, you know, you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: something in a strain that's quite
predominant for a while and you can read
[SPEAKER_00]: away from it and you can get other
expressions to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those expressions that were once
at once very common, not now you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: find them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anyone working with an elite super
silver haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's good super silver hazes
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: His is one that's been passed around a
long time on like Tana Cabana and other
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my personal favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had this Willy Wonka factor where when
you inhale it, it's cherry and you exhale
[SPEAKER_01]: its cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really unique that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very skunk money in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's faster flowering than most hazes,
much more manageable than most hazes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I I like haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sativas in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I'm a peculiar kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I like different expressions of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's kind of like
favorite food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have your top three or four
favorite foods, you certainly don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have weeds that I would like to
smoke regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have stuff that I would like to
like, you know, palate cleansing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will, that I like to have around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say things like even most strains
like like, for instance, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of my favorite cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go a few months without smoking it
and you smoke a fresh batch, it does
[SPEAKER_00]: something different to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something about terpenes and
cannabinoid content and building up
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerances and stuff that, you know,
I think variety is the spice of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I like unique highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sativa highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like indica highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has to be potent and do something
to me that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top three strains, the dead tour
disseminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was it was literally an open air
weed market.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would bring all kinds of strains
from all kinds of walks of life to be sold
[SPEAKER_00]: in small amounts to other hippies at
campgrounds and on the lot and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, my top three might just be the
people that I knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably ask a bunch of old
deadheads and stuff and they might have
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of different stories of what
their top three was, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I what which headband is the
dog head from skunk VA?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I'd have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to check to be sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe his is the 56 day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that we have to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to I'd have to ask to be told.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does not have that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I see collective and and him
a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've known each other a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in that little circle in our
little circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that got passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, J.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: J.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: said lupus headband is fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know what to say about
that one except for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we think that the lupus headband is a very
potent kush, you know, I think that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: fairest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will I can quote Lumpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were very good friends for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, that's just a fucking O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he even said it himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a fucking O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, he's I mean,
I I'm not you know, the Lumpa headband is
[SPEAKER_00]: a good cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's it's enjoyable smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly came out later than the other
headband cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's pretty protective of the name,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he put his name on it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a super nice cut, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is one of the later headbands to
pop up on the scene.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of Neville and NL five thoughts
on the basic five that is the co-parent
[SPEAKER_00]: with skunk one and the M thirty nine skunk
one by basic five from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that one's kind of tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we asked one little question
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't you know, I didn't get the
clearest answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that they're probably the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unless unless he actually says like,
yeah, for sure, this was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not it's at this particular
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's really all I can say about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does seem it does seem like you're
right in the sense that you can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: those two things and be like, oh,
those seem like they're similar or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not there's not there's not
any verification, you know, or of anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what to say about that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, you know, that was I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, do some housekeeping for a
minute and then we'll chat about some
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if there's a legend, you guys want to
come on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's there's a lot of these old
dudes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we're not really bringing
people on that are like blood tenders and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that that are more common era.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to keep this to the history
of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because that's what we love.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we nerd out on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you know someone that you'd be
really into, give them a shout,
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to them, tell them, hey,
there's this podcast, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might be into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we have some different ideas
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a pretty wide ranging
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with the 80s just because
that's kind of like the beginning of what
[SPEAKER_00]: most people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do some other work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some pretty cool stuff planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it takes a certain amount of
research and making sure that the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: people have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to be bringing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things that's going
on with other podcasts is that they tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to be interviews of current people selling
seeds, which is great to get you into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mind of that person and an idea of what
their desires and what their ideas are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seemed like it was underserved and
there could be a lot of interest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of what's going on right now and
how we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's going to be a bunch of
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some different aspects
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just getting his only channel,
only fans channel up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's there's all kinds of
different things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, people are, you know,
like Breeder Steve, Bodhi, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people were raging about getting Caleb on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got him on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bunch of networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work of friends and different things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's all about their
availability and them fitting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we actually didn't
interview Caleb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just brought him on to talk about
something that's close to his heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is breeding goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might have some people on that we're
not even really interviewing them per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just adding their voice to the
larger group discussion, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we have, you know, archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's various people that have
reached out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to fit them all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we want to keep we want to keep
doing all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staten Island, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked to them last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them we might want to just wait
and fit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Breeder Steve would be a good
person to bring on when we want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Switzerland era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of things because he was one of the big
people in the Swiss era, along with Shanti
[SPEAKER_00]: and some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or any number of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not just trying to bring people
on to talk about their history per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can talk about their history and
combine it with some other era that's
[SPEAKER_00]: pertinent to them, that makes sense,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be sure to keep your eyes out for the
notification emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still doing Crowdcast right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we are planning on switching over
to Twitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a Twitch account,
make sure if you don't have one,
[SPEAKER_01]: go make one very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be switching over to Twitch
and it's going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different format on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually put like pictures up on the
screen as opposed to trying to hold them
[SPEAKER_01]: up and like shakily show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, but for the moment, we're going
to keep doing Crowdcast and make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're registered on Crowdcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow the podcast if you
want the notification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then I'll throw a couple of things
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw a plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Breeder Syndicate Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and I and actually quite a few of our
close friends contribute to all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to talk about things at
length, you can always hit us up on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started doing documentaries about
weed, different weed documentaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can show cool movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We post content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We post old pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We post old articles, seed bank stuff,
all that different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look like I'm sitting in a pew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm traveling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in this really odd chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my style, but this is what I
have to do in order to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the Breeder Syndicate,
there's an email for me now set up there
[SPEAKER_00]: that we set up this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people want to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your questions could turn into a whole
episode, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to bring stuff that's people about
people's interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a bunch of cool stuff going on
in the Breeder Syndicate Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chat on there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that Matt and I are
doing is we kind of wing it on this show a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why we can wing it is
because this is our hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, weed history, learning all this
different aspect, trying to like find
[SPEAKER_00]: truths amongst this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my weed life partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we chat about all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, this is just like Matt and I
have been doing this with a big group of
[SPEAKER_00]: friends for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, we just turned on the
camera and decided to bring other people
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really kind of the focus of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of this stuff is pretty
well-worn paths for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really not, you know, the
financial aspect of it is, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's relevant in the sense that you need
finances to exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not know, but the Speak Easy
crew behind this, they do a ton of time of
[SPEAKER_00]: editing and a bunch of work and a bunch of
leveling and a bunch of all this stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind enough to host this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, purchasing seeds from them,
purchasing some merch from them,
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing- Yeah, get your Breeder
Syndicate merch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got merch, we got merch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, joining the Breeder Syndicate,
it costs about the cost of a latte a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not an enormous situation out
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the very near future, there is
going to be major discounts for seed
[SPEAKER_01]: purchases on Speak Easy if you're a part
of their Patreon and our Patreon,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would cost you 10 bucks a month,
but it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the amount of savings that they're
talking about doing is pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we get along with, you know,
obviously Speak Easy are our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hosting our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bringing it to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a bunch of time and energy into
having us talk about a bunch of weed nerd
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, certainly if you want to
support them or buy seeds from them or
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise or get on here and chat,
that helps things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these lives, we do these lives
twice a month, and then we turn them into
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the only podcasts we put out,
obviously, but we're going to keep this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff going, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in this,
we're going to keep rolling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to bring every relevant
bit of history over time to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it takes a while to develop,
so it sounds confident, and we know what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about, and we can get the
people that we'd like to bring on with us
[SPEAKER_00]: on the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bear with us, and, you know,
thank you all for listening, as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have more to do, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got, I mentioned the seed drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a Breeder Syndicate
seed drop with a 56-day headband,
[SPEAKER_01]: blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be me and Nato's first
little adventure together in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one thing I never mentioned,
and it's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps us out a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps the podcast grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please go rate it on whatever platform
you're watching us on, whether it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Stitcher, iTunes,
Google Podcast, any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go throw up a rating, and if you don't
like it, tell us what you don't fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them I'm fucking ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just interacting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interacting is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please go rate it, and yeah,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly rate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, if you want to send links,
if you listen to the podcast on Spotify or
[SPEAKER_00]: on Apple or iPhones or whatever,
you know, share it with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, share it with people you think
might be interested in with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our the main goal for this is
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we really want to get some of this
history out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to spark conversations
amongst people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to get interest in like how
we all got here going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the coolest part about it for me,
honestly, and that's why I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a total hobby, you know,
so I appreciate everyone that listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a time out of, you know,
their Friday night to chat with us and go
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really appreciate all that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you posting, old
memorabilia now, like the stuff you got,
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anybody who's digging up all this
stuff that we've never seen, like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of stuff maybe you only have that
last issue of that magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mad props to everyone who's joining in
on the on the history search, adding to
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because you think that hits some
common history might be common to your
[SPEAKER_00]: crew.
