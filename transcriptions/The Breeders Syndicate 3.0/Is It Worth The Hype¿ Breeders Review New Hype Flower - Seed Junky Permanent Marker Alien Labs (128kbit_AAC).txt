[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_00]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_02]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_00]: seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_02]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our first edition of is it
worth the hype?
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea behind this series will be to
have my review of some of the modern hype
[SPEAKER_02]: flower that is out there and let people
know from an older breeder's perspective
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm experiencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are never paid or sponsored.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all in our own dime and the help
of good friends, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have ensured that there will be no case
of being beholden to anyone for a good
[SPEAKER_02]: review.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to put this out there at the
beginning, like, you know, because people
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of keep that less transparent about
why they're giving good reviews or bad
[SPEAKER_02]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just from the jump, we want to say we
ain't beholden to anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reviews are reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no edit button anyway, so it
wouldn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if we were, I'd just be screwed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that said, welcome to the first
official installment of is it worth the
[SPEAKER_02]: hype?
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I thought I would start with
permanent marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this name immediately brings to mind
like being in high school or just doing
[SPEAKER_02]: art and smelling a Sharpie marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what a Sharpie marker smells
like, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a marks a lot, you know,
very acrid ammonia, like almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard scent to place, but everybody
knows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in your sense memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I was expecting when I got
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, the flower that we have was
grown by Alien Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll throw up some pictures here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, I'm going to start by
going over just the looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure who gets the credit, but that's
the permanent marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really cookie something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I mean, because realistically,
you're not going to get a straightforward
[SPEAKER_02]: answer from those persons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picture up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just from looks alone, the string checks
all the boxes for the most, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: most flower buyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most flower buyers are going to be very
happy when they see a good grown version
[SPEAKER_02]: of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a deep purple, super frosty,
white resin, visually very similar to
[SPEAKER_02]: things like Oreos, OGKB, very dense,
which isn't my preference because
[SPEAKER_02]: traditionally I used to break up flower by
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, with the flower mill grinder and
again, not sponsored, I paid my own money
[SPEAKER_02]: for this overpriced sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I use this because it actually is
a great grinder despite being overpriced.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes like this dense flower be very
aerated, fluffy and doesn't destroy all
[SPEAKER_02]: the resin glands somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get how that works, but it's
pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it could be done to create a
much better price point considering that's
[SPEAKER_02]: all the magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That and that are all the magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, visually it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't complain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very well grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not handled roughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recall ever getting something from
Alien Labs before, but based on all the
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff that I have gotten recently
from that brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: Loud Pack, AKA whoever they're selling
through that day, that stuff doesn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: compare to the quality of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out and props to Alien Labs for
good quality on this shit, for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shout out to my homie who sent this my
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impressions of scent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I like to use scent, I like to
grind it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, prior to grinding, I like to smell
the bud on its own and see what I smell
[SPEAKER_02]: there and see if anything more comes out
after the grind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll explain what I smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beforehand, I wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, doughy, shirby cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that isn't super helpful at all for
folks who didn't have a lot of experience
[SPEAKER_02]: with any decent sourced version of any of
those cuts or S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to try to elaborate a little
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first scent, and this is going to
confuse some people because immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to go to burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first scent I get here is a car tire
shop, like the actual shop where they sell
[SPEAKER_02]: tires.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not burnt rubber, but it is the smell
of a tire shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just one of the many smells in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next scent is the most people
typically refer to as doughy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think of it in the sense of
making a cake, vanilla cake batter at
[SPEAKER_02]: home, that's more of the line of what I'm
thinking as opposed to a baked cake that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can smell the sweetness from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can almost taste it from the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: With cake batter, it's more doughy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's eggs, there's milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of other stuff in it
that when you mix it up, it combines into
[SPEAKER_02]: this very specific smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the smell underlying a lot of
cookies and a lot of triangle,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of OG Kush expressions because of
the triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm only getting a fraction of some of
the smell I typically associate with
[SPEAKER_02]: sherbet types, which is man, it's like all
of that with some peppery spice to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not everybody smells that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's gas in it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the overall, the unique smells
about sherbet, that peppery stands out a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't smell that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some, oh, that's what that
herbaceous smell is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite black licorice, but actually
anise.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's or anise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say anise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anise, anise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the smell that I was going to refer
to as herby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I also say this particular
grove, this kind of very nice old school
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a smell in it that's attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one is harder to pin down other than
herbaceous and fresh, which I just figured
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was from the grinding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not something I often smell in
cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually did pique my interest in the
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I opened up the bag and I started
smelling this stuff, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, that's an old school good smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the grinder, it all smells exactly
the same, except that I was able to pin
[SPEAKER_02]: down the anise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by crushing it up, that flavor or that
scent came forward a lot more for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was much more identifiable than just
herby fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's anise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, manicure overall thoughts on
appearance for being from California
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does look well grown and like someone
put time and care into it, into the drying
[SPEAKER_02]: cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The scent is strong and the dry is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too dry, not overly moist and
unsmokable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resin glands appear intact,
not overly handled and no oxidation or
[SPEAKER_02]: signs from being a greenhouse grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Past is indoor, which I'm learning is like
the classic thing to do now is to stick
[SPEAKER_02]: greeny shit in my LARS and know that all
the people buying my LARS probably aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to pick up on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to go ahead and do is
start with our first sesh and that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be combustion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to grind some up and put it
in the C2 bowl, which I managed to drop
[SPEAKER_02]: straight on tile today and not have break,
which is a first for both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very thick and makes the grade
as a nice built in filter in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the.
[SPEAKER_02]: This side is really thick too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what usually explodes like had I
dropped this bowl on tile, we wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wouldn't be seeing a picture of this
bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these things are special.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're made for idiots like me that drops
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff's solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's give it a rip here and see
what, what, what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor tastes like Sherb to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually got a good flavor to it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like a good version of the
Sherb flavor, which I'm not a big fan of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Sherb flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hate it, but this is tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has really good flavor,
which shows that it was dried and cured
[SPEAKER_02]: well, grown well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manic cured well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Sherb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could describe the Sherb flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so hard for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always do scent, but flavor is much
harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: The rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rip will help with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rip will help with the flavor and me
pinning down some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is why I don't just do just
combustion in these reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've learned after, after coming
across this beautiful technology of vapor
[SPEAKER_02]: wands, especially really dialed in ones
that are very precise, you can really
[SPEAKER_02]: experience flavors and scents and highs
that would have been burned off the second
[SPEAKER_02]: that lighter hit and not giving you the
same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those volatile compounds are still
there and you get to enjoy them and
[SPEAKER_02]: experience them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I'm being destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I love the rip and there's so
many flavors that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's wild, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using my C2 double perk air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Double ratchet perk.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the microphone, this gets a little
complicated, but let me see if I can get
[SPEAKER_02]: this figured out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the rip on and the way it works is I
have a sharpie a permanent marker setting
[SPEAKER_02]: right there that I always know to turn it
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the way these work is you set it
on the bowl for a few seconds,
[SPEAKER_02]: let it heat up, and then you start healing
slowly, slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the vapor starts forming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And realistically, the first hits are
almost all terpenes for me and flavonoids
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really get the best flavor at the
very first hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the sherb flavor, but it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has less flavor vaping than it does
combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't possibly tell you that is as
weird to have no flavor at the rip,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not a knock on the grill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's actually the.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only flavor coming through is the
sherb flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I've experienced with sherb and
usually it's very heavy, but there's all
[SPEAKER_02]: the other flavors have dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the vape session, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this there is a very light sherb
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the person who sent it to me did
refer to this strain is very sherby and
[SPEAKER_02]: just by looking at it and like breaking it
up and smelly and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wasn't totally convinced that it
was that sherby.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I was more convinced it was along
like the gelato that region, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor once you smoke it eyes very
sherb light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor definitely is is all sherb
dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really apologize that I can't break
anything down further when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor of sherb other than.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the flavor of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spicy peppery cookie dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to explain, but the flavor of it
is just this light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even pepper though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's it's very hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's when you have to experience yourself
on that end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get you there sent wise flavors a
little tough and I really thought the rip
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to help me like figure it out
real fast, because usually does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is the first time I've ever had
something go from a lot of flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: combusted then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vape so that's a new experience and see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're learning with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know that was possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know it has a decent high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how long the legs are,
but at least I can feel the start of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it's not surging like Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not making me paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of bright, peppy, happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatty, I guess, so I should probably end
this because I'll just be rambling like a
[SPEAKER_02]: dumbass anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the the rating system that someone
on YouTube offered was skunks,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I'm going to find a little image of
skunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pop it up right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how to do that,
but I'm going to figure it out and I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll figure it out together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to give this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to use a tough rating
system here like I'm going to save the
[SPEAKER_02]: fives for just like crazy exceptional,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fours should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give this a three skunk
rating as in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I would not be embarrassed to
hand to a friend that is a hype strain and
[SPEAKER_02]: have them smoke it like this is good
enough that I think everybody would
[SPEAKER_02]: probably enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even some of us old like for margins that
don't even smoke hype stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that helps any, I hope it helps
someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been wondering what this thing was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it actually smell like a Sharpie
marker to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not even close.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did smell very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did smell very good and it smoked
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're going for a high factor,
I've got to say it definitely has a pretty
good high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start rambling anyway.
