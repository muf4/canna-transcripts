[SPEAKER_00]: So I was gonna go through the Mod Revival
LPs and some of the Punk Rock and Mod
[SPEAKER_00]: Revival compilations are all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is some of my favorite stuff,
especially the stuff that I was DJing the
[SPEAKER_00]: most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, when I actually did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unicorn 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who don't remember,
Unicorn Records.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what's on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sex Museum, The Reaction, Baby Snakes,
Sons of Jet, Raw Material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these are like early Mod
Revival, some Punk, some Power Pop,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of Scott too, and the unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I have a few of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so hard to find back in the day
and to try to track these unicorn ones
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unsung Heroes, Directions, Back to Zero,
The Exit's the Same, Squire, Speedball,
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay Press, Strange Ways, Crook,
Circle, Small Hour, Long Toll,
[SPEAKER_00]: Shorty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phase 2 Mod Collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a Phase 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I have it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time since I've looked at all these,
so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final countdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I remember correctly, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who put these out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nixon?
[SPEAKER_00]: What record level is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-elect the President.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Crawdaddies, The Creeps,
The Daggermen, The Ambassadors,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate Factory, Wild Billy Childish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna see a lot of Billy
Childish stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, that's one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of music is Billy Childish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Countdown Party at Hanging Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is gonna be like Aussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punk, Power Pop, Modern Revival,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see The Saints even in there,
The Upbeat, Painters and Dockers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Countdowns are pretty great,
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compilations, and not really that well
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember, this was a lot of women on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kick, Making Time, The Moment,
The Scene, Stupidity, The Times,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jetset, The Gents, lots of British ones in
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, I mean, that's where a lot of the
magic is, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Countdown Compilation, Smashing Time,
The Prisoners, Fast Eddie, The Ugly Ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Creeps, All Jacks, Stupidity,
The Kick, Long Tall Shorty, The
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflection, Daggermen, Making Time,
All Action Thriller, again, the President
[SPEAKER_00]: one, whatever the label is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's been a while since I've
looked at these, and my memory is bad now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Permanent Wave Comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time, I don't remember what was in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I looked at it, but let's see
what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an epic comp, and we have,
what, The Only Ones, Master Switch,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, The Vibrator's Judy, that's probably
why I bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of The Only Ones, The Spikes Deal,
Another Girl, Another Planet's on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I probably would have bought that to DJ
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: After The Fire, Curse All Flyers,
Cortina's, I like the Cortina's quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, the diodes, yeah, there's good shit
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a really not well-known 80s
epic comp, which, yeah, probably get it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cheap if it's an old epic comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a weird, rare one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot Hits Volume One, The Dance Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got The Candies, Melvin and Dee,
Paul Bultitude, and Paul Bévois,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dee Walker and the Jet Set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another compilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is The Dance Network, I believe that
was Paul Bévois and the Jet Set,
[SPEAKER_00]: ran that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can correct me if I'm wrong on that,
but that's what I took from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We Are The Mods, Volume One.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a compilation, I think this is
more recent put out, but it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: This Is Mod type thing, but with better
bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Sharpe and the Clean Cuts,
that's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart Alex Scooter Boys, Back to Zero,
Small World, The Cords, The Mods,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love The Mods, they're one of my
favorite bands, most generic name,
[SPEAKER_00]: Prisoners, but just killer band.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 Months, with the name of their
compilation LP of their seven inches and
[SPEAKER_00]: other recordings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite LPs by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Uppers on the South Downs,
old famous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teen Beats, Same, Missing Persons,
South Coast Goss Stars, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is on Safari.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Mods, ska, punk, all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mod Live All Dayer, Dedicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like the Purple Hearts,
Lamp Red is bands like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mods May Day 79.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where a lot of people's adventure
into Mod Revival started, at least mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: My roommate, Brian P. Miller, since that's
how everybody knows him by his full name,
[SPEAKER_00]: originally gave this to me as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my introduction to Mod
Revival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is just some killer bands on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer, great compilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot reprinted, this one,
it was real famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can still probably get it
fairly cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an extra copy right here without a
cover, which I guess one of the few things
[SPEAKER_00]: I would keep without a cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch or watch the new, watch the wave,
that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I believe, a Greek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greek comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's made in Great Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so this actually has like the
Head Boys, The Jam, Purple Hearts,
[SPEAKER_00]: Random Hold, The Cure, Sam 69,
The Chords and The Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a bunch of Mod Revival and
some punk in The Cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love these old comps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes it is a bunch of music that
I love, regardless if it's different
[SPEAKER_00]: genres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow they managed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the back door, if I can remember,
I got this because of a specific Donkey
[SPEAKER_00]: song on it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got, now live from Toronto, The Last Pogo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is The Last Pogo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really tell who's on it from this
angle, but yeah, there's great bands on
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cover's often covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like this is, oh no, I can't control
myself, Team B, it's the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very similar to Uppers on the
South Downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, actually, I think,
yeah, I think it's the same thing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it was pressed in Canada
maybe, and that's why it's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4992139.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the cheapest mod comps out there,
and it's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard The Wolf Boys,
Fillin' Hard, probably one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: like weird nasty punk songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really that nasty, but it's like
attempted being lewd, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: MrBeautiful presents All Hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the FUs, Prime Movers, Dane Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else is on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackjack, Last Dan, Dogmatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to hold a phone and get
records back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the best way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wicked Good Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one with like La Peste and a
few other bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it focuses the outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pastiche, Boyz Life, La Peste,
Swingers Resort, Young Snakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuum Heads, more La Peste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a massive fan of La Peste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underrated punk rock fan for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell Comes to Your House.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I got this from Going
Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously not the Friends and Family
price, but no, this is a great album,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a really good price.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this LP, per Going Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always have great prices and great
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite record store on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Secret Life of Punks, Exploited,
Cranja, and The Business, Horskins,
[SPEAKER_00]: Older Boy compilation, Street Punkin' Oi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, maybe I don't have to pull
these all the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Ron British Rare Punk,
but this is like great, great,
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amber Squad, The Stowaways, The Grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so much good on these
compilations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who put them out,
but I have a lot of the seven inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is stuff I wanted to be able to
DJ without bringing all my seven inches
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, especially the expensive ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are great to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're In Seven Inches, Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: God Bless America, Posh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a Posh record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Agent Orange, TSOL, Channel 3,
Shattered Face, Social D, Circle Jerks,
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Cross, Nuns, Baby Buddha, Stepmothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so under underrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple Tones, Crowd, Black Flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always liked the Stepmothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their shit on Posh was always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yutney on the Bowery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a CBGB comp, if I remember
correctly, New York Bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things keep shuffling over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, push those back and bring these up
so we can look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard to put these back in with one
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has, I believe, the Cigarettes
and the B-Movies East, East I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little hard to find, but
Cigarettes, WizKids, worth getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just those two bands alone are worth
getting that comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Thing That Ate Floyd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: 34 Bands, two OPs, 83 Minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too clear, too dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what's on this one
though, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what this is from or what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's old lookout records comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember who's on it, but I bought
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secret Team.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's Lazy Cowgirls and weird shit,
and then The Dwarves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another weird early punk comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had The Cutting Edge, which is another
mod revival Power Pop type comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this thing is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it so blurry?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Razor Records, so it's like Purple Hearts
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Purple Hearts, The Risk,
Beat Direction, XL, Manual Scan,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manual Scan's an American Power Pop band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much collected everything I could
that Bart Mendoza from Manual Scan did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really big fan of his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in San Diego, got to talk to
him a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super nice dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds, Bodds, Mods and Sodds, Squire,
VIPs, Mr. Roots, all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing bands on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popular normal comp that everybody gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Beat Generation and The Angry Young
Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a little more rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little harder to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't know about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, same bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Hearts, Squire, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Shake Some Action.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a Power Pop comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other Shake Some Action, more Power
Pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Crypto Vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like garage, psych.
[SPEAKER_00]: 101 Bandits at 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comset Angels, all you need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VIPs too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unicorn 3, so this is the Unicorn 3 comp
into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, not a lot of these made it into
the USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'll show what's on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Risk, The Presidents, Direct Hits,
Chaos, Scott Os, I guess you could
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounce it, Crocodile, The Losers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also there were these things called
the, what are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mod something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were little seven inch comps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show those in another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were also really rare little
comps that you could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Unicorn ones are basically like
the LPs of the bigger versions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seven inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comset Angels, Accel, Pro-Tex,
Invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the art on this so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can tell, yeah, there's Teddy Boys
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: About halfway through, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Raw Deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is old Raw record stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: GTs, users, sick things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is pre, or maybe Gorillaz are
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see Hammersmith Gorillaz on there
though, but Johnny and the Self Abusers
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long Shots, Dead Serts, and Odds on
Favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somewhere in here you can see Ian
Curtis from Screwdriver, along with Lemmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great LP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the early screwdriver tracks on it,
which whether you're a fan of screwdriver
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, I mean, most people are not,
but it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the No Wave comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: UK Squeeze, The Police, Joe Jackson,
Clark Kent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I have bought this crap?
[SPEAKER_00]: UK Squeeze, Joe Jackson, The Dickies,
The Police, Stranglers, The Dickies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a promo copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably why I just grabbed a cheap
promo copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something you normally get.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a Greek one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's got the Exploited,
Kronjen, Forskins, UK Sub, The Damned,
[SPEAKER_00]: Info Riot, The Business, Go Nads,
Girls That Are Best, The Clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who Eddie Maylove and
Sunshine Patterson is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fad Gadget, Brian Brain, and Joe
Broadberry and The Standouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of oi on there and a lot of
just like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That tends to be how a lot of these old
Greek comps go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what this one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Troublemakers, I think this is Sire,
or no, Warner Brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gang of Four, Wire, Devo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bunch of bands like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popular, popular radio shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Logical Stamps comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see who's on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I've looked at
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was a recommendation from Futon,
if I remember correctly, said this is one
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what we got on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard and the Taxmen doing Chinese
Takeaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Richard and the Taxmen,
the dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BTP Folders, that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted this one for the BTP Folders.
[SPEAKER_00]: BTP Folders are like, BTP Folders were a
Power Pop band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an excellent seven inch and I
swear to God, it was in going underground
[SPEAKER_00]: records on the wall forever and nobody
would buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's such good music that it's one of
those things where I just don't get why
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not in the name, it just didn't
catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions, no answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is just old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's on this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us see ya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I know this isn't made for great
visuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manic Depresses are on here, Red Rockers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the same RZA, the models.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably like a lot of American
punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manic Depressives, early Texas American
punk rock, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avon Calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's so hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glaxo Babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direction of the Directors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Private Dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vice Squad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stingrays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I got that for.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, I love Vice Squad,
but I don't have to get a whole comp just
[SPEAKER_00]: for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easter Front, Cron Jen Live with Channel
3, Wasted You, Shattered Faith,
[SPEAKER_00]: JFA, Battalion of Saints, Circle One,
The Lude, Free Beer, and The Farts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a badass one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are badass bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Detroit on a Platter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look what is on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Zooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Reruns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ivories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong Monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: These boots are made for walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, there's a good version of that
one on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Fast Product Mutant Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like Gang of Four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I would have bought this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mekons, Human League, but Gang of Four for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly just for DJing damaged goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a great DJ song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all know this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danger House.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an original.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they've repressed it,
but hopefully they haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Hangman Samplers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Billy Childish's label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of stuff you'd see on a Hangman
Samplers right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mighty Caesars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tommy Tremolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Gonads.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Craven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anti-Vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocket and Vic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blackhands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like these Hangman Samplers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really see them too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the unissued stuff from Hangman.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're into Billy Childish and like
Popovich and the Milkshakes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Prisoners and Delmonas and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several of these Medway
powerhouse comps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Volume One.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Volume One.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see who's on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never released tracks from the Kings of
the Medway Delta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have killed me with like Gonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one of these shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all these amazing bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like all like digging the same,
not same, similar style, similar music,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar mindsets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this is some of my favorite
music came out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medway powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare and Unissued.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All in all, like those are, again,
really hard to find and never hard for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to track down, but totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called 415 Music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: VIP is on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good punk comp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power pop and punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deadbeat doing the vinyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like Naked Aggression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably why I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Punk TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a fucking Captain Jazz
song on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I grabbed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another seven inch in here of
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a reason I grabbed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks dumb at the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Punk TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Snirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the futon grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that he definitely recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dow Jones and the Industrials are on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Desperate Bicycles might be on
Gulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was definitely a futon
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Futon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the fut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody collecting punk records knows
futon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and futon have been friends since we
were little kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not little kids, but high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a big part of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punk collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stickman's on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really weird one.
[SPEAKER_00]: EW.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oi, glorious oi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me more oi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demand more oi.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a lot older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a weird one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a rare one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you know I collect Manson stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just oddly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second record collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutant Heretics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary Girl School.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison Girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glaxo Babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spizz Oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was Spizz Energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Captain Kirk has always been one of my
favorite songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumpkin Disorderly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Final Solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've all seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other oi bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: UKDK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Original Videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another soundtrack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same kind of bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addicts included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: A collection of Canadian punk rock covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I buy this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks pretty recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's in the wrong area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keen Generate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop Down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keen Generate's on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a Japanese band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best punk rock comps ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it, get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Destroy Our Compilation of 17 Under the
Radar Hits from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done by Futon himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Stiff Sinker on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's named after them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punk Skins and Herbert's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tess Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a 16 year old bus to Kenny Town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compilation of modern oi bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jade Tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all your emo needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All them emo needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get so emotional with that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cry some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local.
Kinda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharazad Makara.
[SPEAKER_00]: Witching Hour Records.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the compilations obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a 10 inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really put it anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like we've lost Beauty of
Compilation for Christopher.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an old one with Cap'n Jazz on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early indie bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be easier because they're not
as packed as tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should be able to get through this
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine Below Zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably got that at a thrift store here
in Bakersfield when they used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be mostly mod.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Baby Snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of names you'll recognize from some
of the other compilations.
[SPEAKER_00]: More Baby Snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scosta.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese Mod Revival.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not really that well known in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found them because of the Japanese mods
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I came across them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Paul Collins Beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the English Beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have more Paul Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Butterfly Collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nerves going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biff Bang Pow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the Girl Who Runs the Beat
Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great album from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite of all the Biff Bang Pow stuff
is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Who Runs the Beat Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paint House I think it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the Acid House album, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these had an unique cover that
they hand did which I thought was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biff Bang Pow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love Is Forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know Biff Bang Pow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get up on your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Biff Bang Pow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Girl Who Runs the Beat Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is like just some weird promo
copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy Racer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a good album.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 10 inch of theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Braces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prime Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some ska stuff on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Broken Hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheap Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chesterfield Kings.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York Classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Thunder's backing band when he
played.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chords.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to have all the Chords and all the
Purple Hearts and all that but it was so
[SPEAKER_00]: common to find that I eventually just got
rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never got it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cry Daddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably have a few of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: R&B garage type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost Spencer Davis-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Crooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, the details keep on running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where all my other Dexys
stuff is but it's not with this and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of upsetting because I'm a big Dexys
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a rare one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, is that Directions or Direct?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Direct Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Direct Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snakes and Ladders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctor and the Medics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just like a Power Puppy song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spirit in the Sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're covering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very Power Puppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Flu Flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was a French mod band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four by Art.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Head Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a lot of play, I think,
for a mod revival band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: R&B, mod revival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi-Fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge inspiration for me even getting into
mod with the Hi-Fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing them live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That song I'll take you there is so poppy
and so catchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The House Martins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fatboy Slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: More House Martins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inmates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another big Power Pop mod revival
band that was pushed pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inmates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In spiral carpets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early, early mod revival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rody Forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack and the Rippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back of my hand version.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the Jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say of course because everybody likes
punk remotely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a little bit love the Jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love the Jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will always be one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weller will always be one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's some dumps in here and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even gotten to the style
council shit yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jet Set.
[SPEAKER_00]: April, May, June and the Jet Set.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some playing cards here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jet Set did that I thought was really
freaking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were ahead of their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too far ahead of their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really trying to do it Beatles-y ahead of
their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now they would make a big hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great Power Pop band.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you even have two of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a kind of rare one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Kynrock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's berserkly stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power Pop nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the Knack.
[SPEAKER_00]: PDF files.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lambretta's singles collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the very first records I
ever got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Power Pop, again, B had this in the
record store and that was one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I bought from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been one of my favorite ever
since and it's never left my collection
[SPEAKER_00]: even through hard times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Les Elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fucking rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this on my eBay watch list forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's kind of... Let's active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Lowe.
[SPEAKER_00]: More common Power Pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manual Scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bart Mendoza in Manual Scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merton Parkas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merton Parkas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mod Fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego's Mod Fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego Mods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mood Six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elton Motello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this Jet Boy Jet Girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop Art?
[SPEAKER_00]: This might have Jet Boy Jet Girl on it,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main LP anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I actually get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bram Tchaikovsky in the motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the weird shaped one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reminds me of Traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traffic did one similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motors were just okay, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Bloody Valentine Loveless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nervous Rex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in thrift stores all over here
and I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe their label dropped a bunch here,
but it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newtown Neurotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a CBS band, but they were
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power Pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plym Soulz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, hold on, I skipped one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, that was a band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plym Soulz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Plym Soulz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this album so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, found it at every thrift store,
but it's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Prime Movers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: James Quartet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, James Taylor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taylor Quartet, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primal Scream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screamadelica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I don't have much Purple
Hearts left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Raspberry still has the scratching
sniff on it, but it does not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one right there is the scratching
sniff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone put it on the actual record like
assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salvation Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that was Nine Below Zero or?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it was another band, but I forgot
their first name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Scooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Second Generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a unicorn band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scosta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secret Affair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Secret Affair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love me some Secret Affair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the Glory Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, as a little mod, Secret Affair
wrote me back, sent me stuff, signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just amazing to their fans,
including like to me, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they were amazing to me,
they're probably amazing to everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: because I ain't no one special at all,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did that out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some really rare new hearts and
Secret Affair seven inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test presses and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Secret Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that was Salvation Army Secret
Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to Skin Deed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, like I don't know where my red
skin stuff is MIA, but Skin Deep was
[SPEAKER_00]: another band like the Redskins that just
killer white soul and just got really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really thrown under the rug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sneaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sponge Tones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic classic Squire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stone Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't original.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be adorned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a repress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite songs of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the repress 180 gram reissue
of the LP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's Style Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure no one gives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only person on earth who collects
and loves like to collect like a Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: version of a Style Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worth nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where are we at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of jumped through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: James Taylor Quartet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bram Tchaikovsky on his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least solo album, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Test Press.
Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Test Press A, Test Press B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, The Things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside My Window Box.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not The Threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, how cool does he look?
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks like he skipped school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another Threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Three O'Clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: More Three O'Clock because you can never
have enough Three O'Clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tower Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Red with Purple Flashes,
The Seminary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I get to the seven inches,
I'll show them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that was nine below zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they were nine below zero and
then change their name to The Truth if I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least some of the band was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now The Truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underground Arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really rare Italian mod.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have the seven inches too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is US Mods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the same band as The Mods.
[SPEAKER_00]: US Mods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best LP ever written.
[SPEAKER_00]: From beginning to end, Nuclear Days.
[SPEAKER_00]: For punk rock, for fucking Power Pop,
any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that album, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about God damn turning
Japanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could care less.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three of them because I give this
album out to people all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnets is great, but Nuclear Days is so
much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I do like this song,
but I prefer, I prefer Trains is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Warner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the end of the Power Pop
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a bunch more other
like mod sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60s Mod.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, I don't even know what's over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says 60 Stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much Bowie to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm going to sell all this Bowie
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really rare Bowie one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this in the wrong section?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is stuff I haven't even sorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like Church of Satan stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you start us?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why this is out of its.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there's a lot more to go through
eventually here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go through some 60 Stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't, I'll hide that bread before
anybody looks at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's also just other
randomness mixed up that I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: shuffled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Swayed Head needs to get in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, thanks for looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for checking it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to figure out what the hell I
got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will check you all later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
