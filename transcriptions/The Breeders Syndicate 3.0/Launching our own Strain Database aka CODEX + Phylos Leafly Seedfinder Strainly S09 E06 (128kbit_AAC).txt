[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_01]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_01]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_01]: seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_01]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
I'm Matthew here with my cohost,
[SPEAKER_03]: Thousandfold, and today we will be talking
about the Codex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Thousandfold, would you like to give
them an introduction on the Codex,
[SPEAKER_03]: a brief one, on what it is and what it
means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this episode is almost an
extension of the episode that we called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Name Game on the cannabis information
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we are launching our own,
quote unquote, strained database that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're calling the Codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, you know, we're going to
talk about databases out there like Filas,
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly, Seedfinders, Strainly,
and how we got to the Codex idea ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we got to building that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And implicitly, like making comparison
between all these different weed databases
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we think is good and what we
think is bad about each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they contributed to, you know,
our sense of cannabis and cannabis history
[SPEAKER_00]: so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, the Codex itself,
I think we'll save most of the details for
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think all we can say right now
is that this is something that I built
[SPEAKER_00]: with the help of Kwasi and Anadine from
the Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in consultation with Matt the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we built it earlier in the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's really exciting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, Matt, I think we'll get
back to it more fully later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you want to say at this
point about the Codex?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just one of those things
that I felt always needed to be done,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've always had this goal in mind of
how to do it correctly, but never a way to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's a big demand for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there are other things out there
that people consider efficient only
[SPEAKER_03]: because maybe their understanding of
cannabis genetics is different than mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the perspective might be different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's about where I'll leave it
for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll jump into it and go deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to kind of start the
countdown, so to speak, we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go through yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, these are, quote
unquote, major cannabis databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one that we have discussed
or sorry, I should say Matt, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: historically has mentioned a number of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's favorite, Phylos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Phylos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a tough one because this is a
major corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I first spoke out about
them, I was concerned because no one had
[SPEAKER_03]: my back at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little bit much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one guy going against a megacorp
at the time, which as far as megacorps go,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not that mega, but for cannabis at
the time, they were making a big splash
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were back and co-signed by many
of the most respected like scientists and
[SPEAKER_03]: geneticists and breeders in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them co-signed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the promise of Phylos initially was
that they could show variants and breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: data.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of the best words for
it, but basically they could tell you how
[SPEAKER_03]: uniform it will or won't breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they tried to say that they could tell
you, or like basically the idea was to
[SPEAKER_03]: match you up with someone across the
country who has equal but opposite genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: variants to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could then combine them and make
this amazing F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the initial promise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that even Phylos would agree
that was their initial statement,
[SPEAKER_03]: how they came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sounded great for me,
like being able to understand something,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, take the material and find out
how it's going to breed without having to
[SPEAKER_03]: breed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there could be clones that are
entered that I'm about to breed with and I
[SPEAKER_03]: can go look and say, oh, oh, it breeds
very narrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I should match it up with this as
opposed to this poly hybrid or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, Matt, here, was it the first
kind of publicly accessible project in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that involved like, I don't know
if this is the right term, is it like
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic mapping or some kind of genetic
mapping?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think medicinal genomics was before them
and there might have been one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it wasn't the first attempt at
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it was, I think, the first big
money attempt at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first time where all these massive
breeders co-signed something and
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately went behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys like Rob Clark, my friend Chimera,
and he spoke about this since,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, lots of people co-signed it and
were all about it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, did you talk about this with Chimera
on one of the episodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure you would have because it's how
we butted heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I mean, like I said,
I was very outspoken about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I finally started having
interactions with them, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a certain spidey sense going off
because they were saying they could do
[SPEAKER_03]: also after they said this this genetic
testing to see how variant it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: they started saying they could do genetic
testing to see relative data, like seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: parental data, seeing like S1s to mother
data, seeing, you know, cousins,
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were claiming that if they were in
their database, they could prove or
[SPEAKER_03]: disprove genetic relation and show how
they're related, which for any breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: what everyone had been dreaming of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is my dream to have this happen in
Canada, like absolute dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: But usually when someone tells me that
they are they can present me with my dream
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately, I'm skeptical because that's
just my instinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why are you trying to sell me my
dream?
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds almost this hasn't been done
in cannabis that I know of to this extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these breeders are backing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask you some questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did get back to me and to their
credit, they called me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're willing to take questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked the questions like, could you tell
an S1 from blah, blah, blah?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, yes, we can for sure tell
an S1 from its mother, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they offered me some free testing
kits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, these were very expensive at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, well, that's that's nice of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's nice of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They give me free testing kits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they aren't so bad, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had some more questions for them and
I don't recall what they were off hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could look at my email and find them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had more questions for them and I
felt like their answer again was super
[SPEAKER_03]: dodgy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I became kind of skeptical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more on the skeptical side because
like now they're giving me gifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're promising me the world or my
dream, at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're giving me free gifts so I can see
this genetic relation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And still, no one's being skeptical
anywhere about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slowly but surely, they had someone pop
out from their company that was,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say, VP of marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be incorrect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be misspeaking on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But allegedly, this person was VP of
marketing and it was confirmed later by
[SPEAKER_03]: Philos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she had a lot to say about what they
could and couldn't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said that they have artificially,
and this is her saying this, not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alleged that they had artificially
shifted the galaxy, which I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: anything about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't prove it, but that was her
claim.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said that, you know, like they
showed preference to big spenders,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said that they don't do long read
testing there, which was the most
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting to me, because if they don't
do long read testing, it means that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not getting the full genetic read.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later on, after talking to someone
else as having it explained, which I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't understand at the time,
they were having something called short
[SPEAKER_03]: read done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you do short read, you're trying
to compare short read to short read.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because of how the clips work,
they might not be clipped at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll never see that same genetic
relation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason they were doing short read
is because it was cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Philos allegedly, I have to be so
careful, was hiring out a lab to do the
[SPEAKER_03]: testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not an actual lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were having other people do the
testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, it was trying to save money and
it shortcut their data so hard that they
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't able to do what they were claiming
allegedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, how we were able to test it was...
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to just make sure that you get
into this bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Allegedly, someone that I trust that's a
very good librarian sent in some samples
[SPEAKER_03]: to Philos of a parent plant, an S1 of that
plant, and some other stuff, and hybrids
[SPEAKER_03]: of that mother plant that they made the
S1s of, just to see how these were coming
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, they were coming back not
related at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two parent plants of one of the
hybrids came back as not being related,
[SPEAKER_03]: and none of them were related to each
other, which we knew was incorrect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because we wanted to be thorough,
we assumed that we had somehow messed up
[SPEAKER_03]: and started from scratch, just to be sure
that we got the right cuts from the right
[SPEAKER_03]: mom, sent them in, labeled correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So always operating on the assumption that
we were incorrect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did this, I think, three times
total, where we went back and forth with
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, no, our science is perfect,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are obviously not related.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must have made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, okay, well, we're going to
go ahead and do this, redo this again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make sure there's no
mistakes and send it in, second time,
[SPEAKER_03]: same thing, third time, bam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, a week later,
Philos shut down their genetic testing
[SPEAKER_03]: after their third response, because it was
starting to get serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if someone promises they can do
something very loudly as their marketing,
[SPEAKER_03]: as I understand it, they need to then
deliver on that science.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the science cannot do what they're
claiming it does and they take money for
[SPEAKER_03]: this service, I think that puts them in a
really awkward position even a few years
[SPEAKER_03]: later, because they're still operating as
the same company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always interested me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is no one's really able to
or really speaks out about this,
[SPEAKER_03]: because again, everybody seems like they
are scared of confronting this
[SPEAKER_03]: corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't do any good to be quiet
about it, because so many people are
[SPEAKER_03]: basing their conclusions on this allegedly
bunk genetic data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing that was real weird was that
some stuff lined up pretty well,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of stuff didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is with data like that,
when you have erroneous data, you cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: use any of it, because you cannot pick and
choose what you think might work by bias.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what would happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to toss it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, just thinking about the way that
you guys tested them, for me, what's buzzy
[SPEAKER_00]: is that from their point of view,
from a risk management point of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: they should have known that this was
possible and that someone would do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: surely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm also still bemused about how this
unfolded, because I'm like, surely that's
[SPEAKER_00]: such a myopic strategy, what they were
doing, if they knew what they were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: fully anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think someone at some point would do
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe if I had a theory,
if my own theory, I have no basis other
[SPEAKER_03]: than feelings for this theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't quote me, allegedly, all that
jazz, sarcasm, speculation, all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think the higher-ups maybe didn't
understand the science and were relying on
[SPEAKER_03]: the people doing the testing and stuff to
tell them how it was going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those people didn't fully understand
the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like all the other agricultural
people that come into cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: thought they were going to take over our
industry with a bunch of PhDs,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then all failed out and flunked out of
cannabis and caused the cannabis collapse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just them that assumed all
cannabis people were stupid, all PhDs that
[SPEAKER_03]: I know did, that came into our field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all, but a good portion of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough to make it a good generalization
and be pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, yeah, to me, phylos out of this
list of databases we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through is the biggest bummer,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones, their pros and cons,
some of them are middling in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also they've done certain things that
are quite cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is just really, really
heartbreaking because the promise was so
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible, but the under-delivery was so
severe that there's just no salvaging it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to say that we talked a
little bit about you asked me a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about my personal journey into the
information space on the Name Game
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually completely forgotten that
these websites were really important for
[SPEAKER_00]: me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phylos galaxy, when I first saw
it, I was just like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the coolest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come to find, of course, that I
shouldn't have believed it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you could see, I'll just say
this, the galaxy, I don't know for people
[SPEAKER_00]: who haven't encountered it, the galaxy is
this visualization of supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships between all these various
plants in the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a graph, what you call a graph,
not like a chart, but like a network graph
[SPEAKER_00]: of nodes and links.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I didn't want to highlight this is
because I did take some inspiration from
[SPEAKER_00]: that for our codecs, even though I was
still very much a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something about that visual
model that I wanted to capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was just, if phylos actually
delivered, I think who knows what the
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream consequences would have been if
they had actually done what they said they
[SPEAKER_00]: would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was a place that I liked
going to for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just, one of the other problems
is that so many breeders, like serious
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders have taken this data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find myself doing it because just
like everyone else, even though I was
[SPEAKER_03]: really skeptical, I was digging through
the galaxy because I was still so
[SPEAKER_03]: interested, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is the data still there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it could be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so, interested in it because this is
everything I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: It answers all the potentially answered
all the questions that I had about my
[SPEAKER_03]: passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of us made conclusions based on
this data and spoke very matter of factly
[SPEAKER_03]: because the science was telling us this,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though we currently understand
now, at least from our perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's not reliable, I still find
myself having to go back and be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh wait, that's not the parent to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I still think that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that that's not correct,
that it happens daily, absolutely daily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be in conversations with other
breeders and we'll be talking and we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: both know that this is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll still be like, well,
phylos did say, and then we'll catch
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves be like, and it really happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how deeply we trusted the science
and how much I, as a man, I consider
[SPEAKER_03]: myself a man of science, how much I
normally trust science, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I found it, I was like, oh,
finally, finally I found it kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say this other thing about the
galaxy that I was personally really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the claim was that, you know,
we had that episode on baselines,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the claims was that the galaxy
visualization would help you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what the poles, the different,
the multiple poles in the gene pool were,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, oh, Northern lights over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like OG over here and there's
train wreck all the way out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, such a dream if it were real,
if it actually corresponded with the real
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before, one of the things that made me
super skeptical too was as they started
[SPEAKER_03]: adding to phylos, they started adding
these weird categories that meant nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had like blueberries as a category.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had, or no, they had blueberry inside
hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp was a category.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush was a category.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes was a cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was just weird shit that like,
this is a whole category.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were several other that were
kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd watch her dropped into
these categories and they never really,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just, I don't know who came up with
this idea that these fell in these
[SPEAKER_03]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same person who came up with
the Emerald cup categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweets and dreams, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweets and dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got the same guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, who is quantifying this as
OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd really like to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we have this discussion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who made this decision and why is this the
scientific conclusion that blueberry is
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp all of a sudden?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very confusing, but that was just,
there were so many things like that that
[SPEAKER_03]: constantly popped up with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain relations they were showing that
breeding showed completely different to
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the fact that they had Urkel not
being related to cookies at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush, not related to cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like a Thai, a Thai land
race as OG Kush clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just by Rob Clark, no less, which I,
you know, I love Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my heroes of cannabis,
but it was all so confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't understand what was going on
with the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but it was a lot of, a lot of things
that weren't quite conclusive
[SPEAKER_03]: contradicting each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I did want to just also point out here
for everyone that, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the past episodes,
we've tried like sharing Matt's screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the web pages and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, unfortunately YouTube
doesn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been a great episode to do
that on, but sadly, if you want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you feel like it, pull these websites
up as we're talking about them and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: look yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of stifled the reviews too for
future reviews and all kinds of stuff now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will have to figure some stuff out,
but we will.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else about Fireless before we
move on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that it's, it's again, like I'd say
the number two, uh, cannabis dirty secret
[SPEAKER_03]: other than the bait and switch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's, it's up there as being
like the dirty secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us know about, but like
everybody's terrified to talk about for
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever reason, because people get mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause so many people have faced
conclusions on this and blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, there are corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the website still there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can people actually still go and see it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know they stopped after that a
literal week and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was no correlation at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they're going to say there was no
correlation to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a week after me and this other person
that's taken very seriously in our
[SPEAKER_03]: community, confronted them about the
results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they said no longer doing genetic
testing, shutting down, going into auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See ya.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was super weird and the timing
was super weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still there, but like it's quite
different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the whole 3d galaxy thing is
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've, yeah, they've kind of like,
yeah, got to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's weird, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like think about all the money that went
into that developing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they take that down ever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like really think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's, yeah, I will say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say this money wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a small amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the people who did the web
development for that, that would not have
[SPEAKER_00]: been cheap there.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is like, you know,
like didn't people pay for this data?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what the hell?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you, they paid for it to be up
there, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I guess they did tell everyone
to download your data because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I figured, I figured at that point,
oh, they're getting rid of it because they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to get sued.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we, did you want to gesture towards,
I don't, I don't think you mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, wasn't there also a controversy around
how they were going to use it or like
[SPEAKER_00]: rumors about how they were going to use
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that, that's what I like called the
swerve with them was that like they kept
[SPEAKER_03]: acting like they were being
inappropriately attacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: By people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people were like going public and
saying, Hey, they're going to get your
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic data and rebuild that clone from
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really thought that they could take
like genetic data and like plug it into a,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, tissue or a cell and regrow
their clone from that genetic data,
[SPEAKER_03]: which isn't even possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anybody with any scientific
understanding was accusing them of this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they were just like, you'd see them
just ripping raging back anytime they were
[SPEAKER_03]: on any kind of podcast talking about,
yeah, we would never steal genetic data
[SPEAKER_03]: because we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like when I was going after them and
I, and having real questions for them and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and talking about what they just were
saying and doing that was contradicting
[SPEAKER_03]: just on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we would never, you know,
rebuild from this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nobody's saying that nobody,
nobody important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really serious to saying that,
but we are saying some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why won't you address this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the people behind phylos were super
nice and that sucks because like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have had a nice friendship with
some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine in another life, you know,
had it not been something where something
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so passionate about was so played with
by what I considered maybe allegedly
[SPEAKER_03]: culture vultures, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if any of you, by the way,
have had, uh, experiences with phylos,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely tell us about it in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comment below if you ever had your stuff
tested by phylos and let us know what your
[SPEAKER_03]: feelings are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it was real?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, do you trust their data and why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even, or even if you're like me,
just like, uh, you know, armchair,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever theorists, uh, you know,
tell us how you feel about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what eventuated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super interested to see the comments
on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, otherwise we can move on to Leafly
if you're ready, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leafly shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't even remember when they popped
up, but like they were probably one of,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the biggest, I think out of all
these sites, other than phylos,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was like a mega corporation,
but as far as like advertising,
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing, money spent on stuff like that,
I'd say they were a much bigger website
[SPEAKER_03]: and probably generated a lot more revenue
overall than phylos, uh, from other
[SPEAKER_03]: companies in themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could imagine, um, they were kind of
like a strain database where they listed
[SPEAKER_03]: what they felt were popular strain names
and they would give you blanket,
[SPEAKER_03]: like generic data about like how much
percent indica and how much percent
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa, or if it was all indica or all
sativa, you know, most, what's the time it
[SPEAKER_03]: would just say indica sativa or hybrid,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, it would tell you like,
Oh, this helps with your anxiety and pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We give it a score of 6.4 out of nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was stuff like that and it was
real goofy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where they got the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's like, I agreed with very
little on the site ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember, uh, there was a funny
picture of AJ from, um, sour fam and he
[SPEAKER_03]: had a pillow that Strainly had,
or I'm sorry, Leafly had sent him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a pillow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leafly had sent him that said,
uh, sour diesel and had like the S and
[SPEAKER_03]: then it had I in the quarter for indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, sour, you know,
like, I just remember that really
[SPEAKER_03]: distinctly and kind of just snickering a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to add a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe a lot of the information is
crowdsourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, no, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the like effects section and
the smell and flavor section, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do is like, uh, I think anyone
can fill out like a survey and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregate, uh, this crowdsourced
information and present like the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregated results, like the top,
you know, like the top scoring things,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, from their reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, on the one hand, it's kind of an
interesting concept because as we know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are very subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, okay, like, uh, being charitable,
I can see why.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just survey lots of people and the
more people, uh, the more information we
[SPEAKER_00]: get, then the better our information is,
which yeah, sort of makes sense in a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad, in a broad way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick, real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me interject.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also something that phylos had
done when they were talking about their
[SPEAKER_03]: legacy clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of my main questions that I
was asking, like, how are you determining
[SPEAKER_03]: your legacy clones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how does that work?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and they were crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as I understand it, they were
crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they got a bunch of people entering
the same cut as Chem D, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's legacy Chem D.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the real one original, because so
many people had it must be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that this is like a,
in cannabis, this is a big no-no because a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of times the most past cut is the fake
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like it just, the uncirculated
one stays here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another one goes out to the masses for
$20 a clone at a local Spencer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, wanted to add that part.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, like, you know, uh,
like I was saying, broadly speaking from a
[SPEAKER_00]: high level, it looks like a somewhat sound
strategy for the subjective, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some subjective information in a
more objective fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you consider the idea that like
the people who are writing reviews of
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote OG Kush and the likelihood
of them actually having the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the actual same cut or the same
flower sample is so low that ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you don't really know what they're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have no idea where they're,
they're actually all talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the other thing I would say about,
oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that one of the major,
I think differentiating factors with
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly as well, I think out of all of
these, it's the most mainstream one,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more targeted at like end
consumers, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people midway up the chain,
you know, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, no growers really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know many growers who like,
even the people who are brand new knew
[SPEAKER_03]: this, that, that Leafly was silly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's just, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're a grower, you already know
that that's incorrect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just by happenstance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought that was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the other thing was worth pointing
out as well as they do have lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'll tell you something funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a really, really good memory of
going there years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and seeing that I'm, I'm pretty sure,
and I'm pretty sure that their OG Kush was
[SPEAKER_00]: still following that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon tie Pakistani myth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did look at it last night and they
had improved like some of the entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I remember like they, they had some
fake stuff for chem dog as well that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd made up and now it's all gone and
they just say it's like dog, but unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, it looks like they've made some
effort to clean some things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause have you had, you've had some
interactions with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you met?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, they're the ones that I've had
like zero interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're corp, corp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what else was I going to say about?
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I remember them being involved with
the Seth Rogan goofy shit when he popped
[SPEAKER_03]: up with that allegedly houseplant satire
crap and, uh, was doing his chem dog,
[SPEAKER_03]: the sativa chem dog, his houseplant sativa
named chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I did want to pull on one thread,
which is something you mentioned in the
[SPEAKER_00]: name game episode, which is like the
possible risks in saying that this quote
[SPEAKER_00]: unquote strain, and again, like,
you know, they don't distinguish is this
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh no, that could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do say whether it's a clone
or like a line, but the danger in them
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, Hey, this strain is, has these
effects and it's like somehow really
[SPEAKER_00]: reducible to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, it's easy to quantify them like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned, you know, one of your
questions in the name game episode was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, can we really call these systems
like proper formal medical systems?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with Leafley is that they
really make it look like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dangerous, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, that's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like, like in another world,
that's probably pretty, like it would be a
[SPEAKER_03]: legal grounds to like, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think they want to be in that
position.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they intend to be in that
position.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're trying to help,
but like, they just don't understand what
[SPEAKER_03]: the thing that they are talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand the thing that they
are the professing to be the all-knowing
[SPEAKER_03]: narrators of being what they are and how
they present themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even understand the basics of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they can't, if they're telling you how
this is going to affect you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the strain that you got at the collective
name, this is going to affect you this
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on the, on, on, on like a,
how do I put it on like a more positive
[SPEAKER_00]: note?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that it does show me,
if nothing else is how many people still
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do care about this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that's so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people are, some people are buying
stuff and wanting to know more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you smoke is, you know,
um, so it does, it does gesture towards
[SPEAKER_00]: something I hope better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, yeah, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's, was there
anything else about Leafly?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just so satire fucking goofy that
like, it's one of those ones where I wish
[SPEAKER_03]: again, like I wish shows like this would
capture the interest of the end user,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm not sure there will ever be a case
where that many people are that interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in what they're smoking and why it could
potentially be affecting them the way they
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know, like, I just don't see
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people just are like, I don't care
what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put it in the bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's typically how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, how'd I put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be some percentage of
the population that at least wants some
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiating like information,
you know, to be able to at least help make
[SPEAKER_00]: the decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I, I like to hope that there's
still like a, oops, that there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: like a significant number of people who do
care to a degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so, but just, you know,
actually I take, you know what I will say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been very surprised with the past
year, just within the past year,
[SPEAKER_03]: how many people have showed up and seem to
deeply, deeply care about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that's been surprising because
I've never really seen it be more than 20
[SPEAKER_03]: in my life at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you know, even with the
forums and stuff, there are people that
[SPEAKER_03]: like acted like they were super serious
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like when you would get into serious
discussions, with them about why something
[SPEAKER_03]: is or isn't like in the serious strain
discussions, if you went against anything
[SPEAKER_03]: that they believed it was like,
hell no, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody was really, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always a really small group of
people that were trying to like destroy
[SPEAKER_03]: their own bias to confront their own
biases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I could frame that in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think how I see that is that people will
make some minimal effort to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whether the information is good or not
is probably beyond their effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you tell them that it's not good
information, a lot of people just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to expend any more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to have, just want to like,
um, cozy up with the idea that they
[SPEAKER_00]: originally had that they were happy with
and they don't want you to like ruin their
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if there's nothing else on Leafly,
we can move on to one that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still feel quite sentimental about,
which is seedfinder.eu.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where do you want me to start with
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe just a general, like a very
broad description of like what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: information you can find there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so Seedfinder is one of the more,
I think, serious attempts at trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: capture, uh, genetic data presented from
the breeder side as more of a database.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's more of a database for seed
buyers and breeders, people who are deeply
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it started, that's mainly what it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a big advertisement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a big moneymaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's actually a, sorry, that that's
maybe something we should make a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: explicit about Leafly as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, the driving incentives is
definitely like, uh, cross marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big, big, big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next to your, your, uh, on your like
flower, you know, your, your plant strain
[SPEAKER_00]: entry, they're going to be like,
I imagine like dispensaries where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get this, like, you know, blah,
blah, blah, seed companies where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Seedfinder, yeah, like Matt was saying
seemed mostly to be about lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they do have like, uh, a lot of them
do have these like quite long form
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions, which are pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, accuracy aside, um,
they do have little sections on effects as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I believe, but it doesn't seem like
it's much of the focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Matt was saying seems to mostly be
about lineage and then some, maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, some reading information.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a while they were integrating like
forum data and pictures and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really helpful for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as far as like the best you could get
and, and for a long time, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still the best you can get,
you know, like it is one of the best for,
[SPEAKER_03]: for doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, regardless of accuracy, what they put
together was special for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just to make the point as well,
I think it was also partly crowdsourced or
[SPEAKER_00]: semi at least semi crowdsourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it started, they contacted me
directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, and they asked me if I would,
um, add my strains to their site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told them, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were such a small site.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what was going on with them
at the time, frankly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wasn't going to put a lot of time
into someone else's website.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was trying to run my forum and ship,
you know, and grow and take cuts and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wasn't really into that, but they
were kind enough to add a lot of my
[SPEAKER_03]: strains for me and import a lot of the,
um, the pictures and descriptions and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I have a very, very like soft
spot in my heart for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they were very kind to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took the time to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, they did it pretty, I mean,
fairly, some of it is wrong, but like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to get a lot wrong when
there's like 200 things to add.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I don't fault them for a lot of
bad stuff that they got wrong with mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were, they were very kind to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely struck me as like a fairly
or, you know, relatively earnest project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think there's still a real charm
about going to it because it looks so like
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it definitely looks like
it's from the forum era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's no doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's like done out of
Spain or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a lot of like Spanish and central
European, um, seed banks linked to it and
[SPEAKER_03]: like advertised all over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the banks are kind of shifty too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a bit of a time capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I went onto it last night again as
well, and it looks exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't expect it to change ever,
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, I think I did also do
another comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did on Leafly where I was like,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember looking at this information
here and it was quite wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even tell you what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was like cookies or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was like gelato or just one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they had improved it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting is that somehow
people are still running it and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because these things, quite a lot of
work to maintain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my last interaction with them was
several years ago and I was reaching out
[SPEAKER_03]: to them cause I had had a wild idea of
doing a private genetic database for
[SPEAKER_03]: myself because I was going through their
stuff and I was realizing, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_03]: this has gotten so crazy through what
people have put in here that they've made,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they've created, what names they've
attributed to themselves, what clones
[SPEAKER_03]: they've claimed to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had gotten so crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to buy their software to use
privately and like sign NDAs or whatever I
[SPEAKER_03]: needed to do to get them to sell it to me,
just to be able to use it for myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: for, for myself and to show friends like,
Hey, here it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and I'm the only one that can add to
it, but, uh, never got a response.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand that because this is,
this might be their, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: livelihood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would they do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, uh, a very highly developed and
programmed site.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that was, that was the last time
I tried to talk to them, but, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, props to them either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I wasn't salty about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were in their shoes, I probably would
have ignored it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I should say as well, definitely,
um, a lot of kudos to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, like any approach has
trade-offs, you know, even ours will,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and for them, you know, they were able
to get a lot of data, a lot of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably quite good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I imagine, you know, the drawback
of any kind of crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endeavor is, it's hard to say that
everything's been, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it in the same way that everything's
as reliable as everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, just one of the trade-offs
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is a very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you, when you do it that way,
literally people were pretending to have
[SPEAKER_03]: seed companies that never existed,
pretending to make seeds that were never
[SPEAKER_03]: made and made up a fake backstory that
they could come back check, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: years later and start companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made this back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at my entry on seed fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like shit, like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't even believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even think to you, you know,
but yeah, that's the kind of stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: comes from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and again, I'm sure like they would
have tried, you know, um, but when,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's set up like that, when that is
the strategy, there's, there's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: a limit to how much you can go and vet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so much data on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no way someone could go and
come through all of it, um, and verify all
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the other thing I'll point out that I
liked, uh, from like, uh, uh, information
[SPEAKER_00]: representation standpoint, um,
they did have quite a neat way of setting
[SPEAKER_00]: out lineage, uh, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the visual presentation of it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the only thing is that, um,
I think that their format did preclude
[SPEAKER_00]: like more complex families or like,
you know, representing complex families
[SPEAKER_00]: well, because it's like, uh, uh,
that's what I would, it's like a tree
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but some families are weirder than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How could they ever have imagined
fricking, uh, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: How could they ever imagine that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you, if you go look at the genetics
for this, this plant, it's like nine pages
[SPEAKER_03]: long of just like a tree of cookies,
cross back to cookies, to cookies,
[SPEAKER_03]: to cookies, to cookies, to O G to cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's too, it's wild,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some blue power in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, but yeah, I definitely have like
fun memories of spending, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many an hour on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go click like somewhere and click
subscribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the little bell thing right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you wanted to say about seed
finder?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just that it was, you know,
it's, it's what most people consider the
[SPEAKER_03]: best attempt so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Strainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll say this, Matt, before you get
into it, like, I didn't know much about
[SPEAKER_00]: this one because, um, it's more of a
marketplace and, and any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace always has a serious bias
towards North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just like, ah, it's not really
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did go and look at it for the first
time, like really in any depth,
[SPEAKER_00]: like last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, before this, I didn't really
know what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested to hear your take on it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look too deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I was like, okay, they're trying to
be like the eBay of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they do auctions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, um, they do grow gear,
they do seeds, they do clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty, pretty comprehensive in terms
of like stuff that you can get,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also kind of like the other websites
really quite overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you get lots and lots and lots of
brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, it seems like almost anyone quote
unquote can have stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, maybe a little bit like,
okay, how do I tell like who's legit and
[SPEAKER_00]: who's not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the target market,
it's definitely not as mainstream as
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more about growers and breeders
than like, yeah, consumer smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or they also sell pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a new one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that's what I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, having a look,
a quick look at what, what can you tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like out of all these people,
I, I have the most interaction with these
[SPEAKER_03]: dudes and it's, I can't even say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there are things that I've found that
about their site from, from the jump,
[SPEAKER_03]: like they contacted me, asked me if I'd
sell on their site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, I don't know,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks kind of shady.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have had a lot of bad experience by
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, they sent me a thing and it asked
for my social security number.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, guys, like, who are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, they told me who they
were and more about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understood why, what we was going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not bad dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're a couple of really nice
programmer guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is their side job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do this as their hobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not a big company at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a couple of really nice
programmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, they just, they're from another
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they didn't understand like the
complexities of asking like black market
[SPEAKER_03]: growers for their social, because what
they were trying to do is make it easier
[SPEAKER_03]: for people to sign up for, um,
to receive credit card payments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what the social would be used
for, signing you up for a merchant
[SPEAKER_03]: account, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, it also left them room for
a lot of liability, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I talked to them about it and like,
they were like, Oh my God, I hadn't
[SPEAKER_03]: thought about it from that angle,
the liability, you know, we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: try to figure out a workaround for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually went around trying to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: When phylos, when I was battling phylos,
um, and I said, no one had my back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not entirely true because after about
six months, strangely had my back and they
[SPEAKER_03]: came out and, you know, made a big public
announcement on their site about why this
[SPEAKER_03]: is incorrect, what's going on here,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I had a lot of admiration
for that because it, it's not easy to take
[SPEAKER_03]: stands in this, in this community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that time, there was no,
the pros and cons for standing up against
[SPEAKER_03]: a corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were no pros, all cons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, they did it anyways, cause it was
the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, um, you know, I've run into
problems where people pretend to have my
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds on there and are selling fake
versions of my packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, if I let them know they'll,
that person's gone, they'll never sell on
[SPEAKER_03]: that site again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't, like they're doing their,
at least due diligence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if people report it, they,
they'll, they'll handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't say anything bad about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, like I have nothing but kind,
warm feelings for those dudes for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I'll say this as well,
because it's a marketplace, their primary
[SPEAKER_00]: motivator is not necessarily data in that,
you know, in the same way as like seed
[SPEAKER_00]: finder or, or Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are just about facilitating,
you know, transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easily facilitate transactions between
person to person for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis genetics or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those things are difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the thing, like, despite my own
stuff being like fake versions of my stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: being sold on there all the time,
because I think it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's hella like piratey and
like cool to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't hate on it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing I can negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say about things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's kind of punk rock either
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like everybody's going to get
fucked to some degree, but like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think overall, I think it's a neat
experience and we need the ability to be,
[SPEAKER_03]: to do person to person buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realistically, it's buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not doing your research,
then that's on you, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so in that sense, I'm also very supportive
of what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was exactly what I was going to point
out that the onus is less on them and on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everyone else who's in the
community to be vetting each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a peer peer review process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like, like, like if you were like a
dickhead on eBay, you know, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get very far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, luckily they are way more responsive
than eBay.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been so cool over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, yeah, I'll shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's cool about what we're doing,
I think today, I didn't really realize
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's a little bit of a history
on like these different, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, online projects, whether they're about
like e-commerce or data or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like this has been the recent,
you know, 10 to 20 years of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in the internet age, in the social
media age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's cause you know,
we, we talk a lot about social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we haven't talked about some of these
websites before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think now that we're getting into,
I'm like, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this is definitely stuff that I
didn't really think about, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: us discussing before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad we got, you know, people,
people are probably used to hearing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talked with someone about this
earlier, like I'm often like dismissed
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm called a hater of the
industry, you know, because I don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: people ask me questions about certain
breeders and like it really does from a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of perspectives from people who don't
know, like sound like I just hate
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just am dismissive of everything
and everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but in reality, I have a lot of like
personal interaction with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: people and, um, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to be able to say something nice about
good people in the industry, because I
[SPEAKER_03]: really, unfortunately feel like it's so
far and few between, um, as a,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a gray area, like that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It draws a lot of people like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to compete with them in the
same marketplace and the, and the same
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and the same passion in this
case, which is really, really screwy for a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like we have a perfect thing
to show, you know, our codecs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, really excited to talk
about it and to launch and share it,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, of course has serious limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, no one, you know, no one's going
to get this perfect, at least not anytime
[SPEAKER_00]: soon from what I can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like Matt was saying, definitely
worth shouting out all the like cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool effort and work and time that people
have put into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing I wanted to say before
phylos had their, their visual galaxy seed
[SPEAKER_03]: finder had their galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was visual.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that part too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually started with nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just phylos smart phylos galaxy had
all the like bells and whistles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it was 3d and like you could
fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 3d in the same way, but it was,
um, I don't know where it went.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a star map type thing,
uh, on seed finder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say, but I think I had a
hard time finding it at least last time I
[SPEAKER_03]: looked for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I ever saw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was there from the site start and
it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I really wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was a beautiful representation of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll say this, uh, maybe I don't
know how necessary or a little barb it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, one thing that can be said
about seed finder and strainly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can kind of feel the passion
there a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can kind of tell that these
people who like really care and like just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to help and not saying that
leafling phylos don't carry all,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to help at all, but like,
you can kind of see that there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: motivating factors with those two
websites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in, in the comments below,
I'd love to hear people's thoughts on all
[SPEAKER_03]: of these sites, whether it's Grainly,
your, your experiences, exchanging stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, Leafly, I'm sure we're going
to have plenty of funny stories about
[SPEAKER_03]: Leafly and people's experiences there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if nothing else, don't strainly Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to give a couple of shout outs
to one broadly, the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course, like we've talked about the
forums plenty, um, as far as, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go as sources of information,
obviously very important, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously extremely noisy and,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And extremely incomplete, extremely
incomplete now as well as noisy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, forums, there's no
formalization of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't like, formal models or maps or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just people talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously still a very important site
of, uh, exchange and information,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, irreducibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I wanted to point out one other
place that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people know about, um, and it's
called grow diaries and it sounds a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: naff, but why I like it is that they don't
do that thing where they say, ah,
[SPEAKER_00]: here is chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, anyone can grow
anything, like any kind of thing that is
[SPEAKER_00]: vaguely got to do with chem or says it has
to do with chem is under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is clever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, we go by company and product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can specifically look at,
like, say you've bought something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at buying something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually go and look at that
particular brand or seed company or
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at people who are actually growing
those seeds and not like any kind of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: white label version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the other thing I like about how
they present information is that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: structured, they structure it so that
like, you can kind of choose which week of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow you want to go and look at any
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to me, they've got an example of like
good structured information about
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's grow historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't see it presented like that
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, are there good growers on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think it's definitely a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's definitely like,
uh, anyone, anyone can rock up and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there a lot of veteran growers and
breeders on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know it well enough to be able to
tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, it suffers from some of the same
limits as the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it also does that thing where it
tries to aggregate, like effect
[SPEAKER_00]: information or like they survey,
like the grower and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what did you smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what effects did you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they don't, they don't make as
bold a claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they don't, what they don't do is
they don't try to like abstract from
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone and say, like, this is the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just say, this is this person's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that person's data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine as a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's like an honest way to
present information, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever information that you have without
overstating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, at the same time, you know,
it's still also definitely caters towards
[SPEAKER_00]: a more mainstream growing audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go on that site, I could almost bet
without even going to it that like 99% of
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like DNA greenhouse benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just bam, bam, bam.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top, the top new ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most, you know, all those big brands
will definitely have the most growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: the most diaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they represent the biggest part of
the marketplace has to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would we be able to find a riot seats?
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could, but it may not be as
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt CSI probably as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, you know, a point of
difference here is that, uh, it's specific
[SPEAKER_00]: to the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's specific to the breeder and you don't
have to deal with the weird, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, what the, what do they, what do I call
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like kind of conflation, um, of varying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, like, seed products from all kinds of
different people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, was there anything else I wanted to
say about these guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even though I didn't take that
much from the website, it did give me an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that like they're different ways to
model cannabis information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this is actually pretty structured
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not a bad site.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone else has done it like
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to grow diaries and check
them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, decent, decent, decent site.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, I was like all about ready to
knock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, ah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just probably going to be on nudes
and like a, like a roll it up,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that I'm an idiot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, to me, it's like an improved version
of like a forum growth rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, you know, like everyone,
you know, grow diaries are forums,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, the problem is that like,
it's very hard for you to come through the
[SPEAKER_00]: data in any kind of structured way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, whereas bro, all the riot seed stuff
in here is club riot seeds, whatever that
[SPEAKER_02]: is club riots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some seed company called club
riot seeds that popped up within the last
[SPEAKER_03]: like year or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw it and I was like, I was like,
all right, I'm like, can you get mad about
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's hilarious, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hilarious that they didn't even
think to look up like their, their name
[SPEAKER_03]: might conflict with another reader like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're, and like, look at all these
pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I found one from you, strawberry
cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not theirs, but look at,
look at their stuff, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like all auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link it in our chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be the like one grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually like one of your actual
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did cherry GMO Z too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was up there, but yeah,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you have a couple of people
growing your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be one of those, and maybe one of
those websites that's like, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be like more European growers or I
don't actually know club riot seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: shout out club riot seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even hate on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're probably, they're probably
from another country and don't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: clue who I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't expect you and don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not assume that they, they,
they knew there's any malice.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, any, you know, anything else met while
you were on there, anything else?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it just looks kind of decent though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's an American auto flower
cup coming up, but apparently here in LA,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indocat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: CSI and his auto flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to jump into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you'll see he's probably going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's an interesting leak that did
not expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, what was the last?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was going to say is that if I were
going to set up like a, like a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: database, it'd be like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be, I would definitely take a cue
from that, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can already, as a, as a,
as a developer, like I can already see the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they've structured the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually do lots and lots of
cool stuff with how they've structured the
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, uh, shout out to Sol Ray for being
like one of the only dudes to grow my
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to someone for rep in his
knock on it's not close.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whoever else the other person I can't
see fire in fire out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing else, we can move on to the
codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our codex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember how it got started?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, vaguely vaguely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you tell me what you remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you asking me if there was
anything I had ever like tried to want to
[SPEAKER_03]: build or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give more context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I remember some other weird things
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like right after Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everyone was in that, like,
yes, like post-Christmas pre new years,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's familiar at a loose end a bit,
maybe people just chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think you were talking to quasi
about a database or like having thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, so it started with you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think I just was like,
I think quasi had some like pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, if we wanted to do like
a, a simpler version of this, I could see
[SPEAKER_00]: how we could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could, you know, I couldn't
prototype something pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then you were just like,
you were just like, yeah, do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you even, we didn't even know each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we didn't have a lot of interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, right before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder if you actually thought
anything would come of it at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I didn't, when, when someone had asked
me that, like, well, if I had any,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I could have anything built,
what would it be?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, the one thing we all
need is like a reliable genetic database.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and I talked about the
philosophy behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I, I was kind of like offhand
statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was late at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I didn't really think my body was
going to be able to do much of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like within two days,
there was serious development done to the
[SPEAKER_03]: point where I was like, Oh my God,
like I've got to start entering stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause these guys have done so much work
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't like, I gotta do something like
I'm going to have to act.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is serious and like coming
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is some serious stuff and can
make and, and, and I think, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: help help at least be one resource for
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: To go to that they can, hopefully people
will feel as reliable enough, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: for their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell a bit more of this from my side
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that in the U S Christmas break,
isn't that long for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: working, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like only like a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the biggest holiday on the
planet for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, it's it's Christmas happens
during summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like this, you can imagine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of almost shuts down for like two
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like from like December to like
fib.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like the country goes really
quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people would just go out to like,
people go to the beaches and stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's always this kind of weird,
it's a nice time, but it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit restless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weirdly quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when the idea came about,
so obviously context, I'm a web developer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the idea came about, like,
I was like, I've actually done some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with similar kinds of data and
representing similar kinds of data,
[SPEAKER_00]: like relationships and, you know,
kind of like network maps of
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, I think I could
actually like do this pretty quick or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least have a prototype pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think I just had the,
I got on the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of energy and I was,
I had like a manic couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe like two to three weeks of just
smashing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was insane, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Dave's night I was smashing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, you'd be like, you know,
is there anything else like you can think
[SPEAKER_03]: of?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there'd be something I'd pop up
and I'd be like, I, cause I have some
[SPEAKER_03]: context.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a web developer in my past life
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know how much a lot of this stuff
costs and I know how much like knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: it takes to do this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the asks that I was asking weren't
necessarily things that I could achieve
[SPEAKER_03]: easy, but I know how much it would cost to
have them implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when he was asking like these
things, I was like, I don't even feel
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable saying, you know, but in,
in eventually you get it out of me and
[SPEAKER_03]: then it would be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, a few hours,
it seems it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cause it was like really watching
something come to life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a slow progression.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, boom, and it's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, this is everything I
ever wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's like, oh, it's so serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fun period for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I was on holiday and I got to
talk to Matt, who I'd never interacted
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is nuts that we're
doing this, but yeah, it was a blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also will say it was a lot of trust in
you for me because you really didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could have been the scumbag that
everyone said and just been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, thanks bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to know you, you know, but like,
I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that trust too, because I knew how
much time and not just time, but like
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a labor of love doing something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're really passionate about
cannabis as it shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, this is an actual labor of love
like it is for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the same time, it wasn't just like
building it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It became our baby, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a baby together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of that baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe at this point we can state some
of their aims because.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think like what we said before,
um, information like this is very
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It carries a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I, I think in terms of
strategy, one thing I really didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do was overstate or over represent
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew off the bat, we weren't going to
be doing like effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't going to be doing smells and
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, let's stick to our
strengths here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt has.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of knowledge from his time,
his interactions with people, his actual
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the information we want to
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want to yet over or
understate that, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know it's not like genetic or genomic
mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we're never going to do that,
uh, conceivably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next best thing was like
presenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, Matt, how would you frame
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how would you frame the information
that we have on there from your point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view?
[SPEAKER_03]: The information we have on there,
the way I'd frame it is by talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: all the things I saw wrong with everything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the little steps in my brain I
took to like, try to, to beat all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like the crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing that I knew that had to
happen was no more crowdsourcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also knew that's probably going to
piss a lot of people off and sound very
[SPEAKER_03]: elitist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the first thing that's going
to happen is people that are going to feel
[SPEAKER_03]: excluded because their input wasn't taken
into account, or they're going to think
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that their input wasn't taken into
account.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and realistically what my idea was
from the beginning was to, and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of like perceived ideas
about what's going to happen with it and
[SPEAKER_03]: like the intention behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And agendas, but realistically,
like my idea for it was to have
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially a place where people could go
look at the most important strains in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, the baselines that we talk about
on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, land races get realistic, like not
just suppose data from people that may or
[SPEAKER_03]: may not be cannabis people over there that
are trying to sell seeds and blah,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People who are over there that are
researchers that are doing this stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: are, they have good input are going to,
be putting in like to the land race part.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not my expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, but with, with my, the one thing
I do know is people because I've been in
[SPEAKER_03]: the scene so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not necessarily just about my
knowledge of strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about my knowledge of people who have
the knowledge of those strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: most importantly, which is what the show
is in a sense, you know, like me bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: those people together to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this is aggregating that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could, almost see it like Matt is
facilitating, curating this database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, obviously a major
difference between that and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other databases we mentioned is that these
people weren't part of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: conceivably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we're not there or present,
um, when a lot of this was going on and
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, Matt is one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though, of course, you know,
you have the obvious trade-off of it
[SPEAKER_00]: being, um, Matt and perhaps like a smaller
group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the benefits you get,
uh, so, okay, we'll say, we'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up that like we have no,
no ambitions or delusions about the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect, you know, like how perfect the
information is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously going to be Matt's best
account based on what he knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you do get is accountability,
transparency, and like responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, this is a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's not even probably near done,
but we're going to launch it and Matt will
[SPEAKER_00]: conceivably be working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually we might get more people to
come and help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so again, the idea is that keeping it
to a smaller group of people that we trust
[SPEAKER_00]: will at least introduce, um, a more
reliable process, um, of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and more reliable feedback loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the information may not be
perfect at any one time, the hope is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can just keep improving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that the same people are going to
be responsible for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, a lot of it's going to be
different than what people perceive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not adding my own strains on there
because I don't think my own strains are
[SPEAKER_03]: like the history or part of the history of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've done anything that's
revolutionary per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, my strains are not going to be on
this site presenting them as like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like this, these are important,
kind of sneak them in the back door.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what it's for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like built with an agenda like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, realistically what I wanted
was something for me to go and resource
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't need to resource and go on my
strains because they're in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good point,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were building what we wanted to
consume ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at them bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that was so well timed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we just wanted to, ultimately we
wanted to build something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves would be interested in going and
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we wanted to build the thing
that we dreamed of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I wanted something I could share
with my breeder friends, like as a
[SPEAKER_03]: resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was mainly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, Oh, sorry, sorry, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing that I wanted to just make
sure was really clear, um, to people is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're not trying to have every single
cut of hype or noteworthiness on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about like what Matt was
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can consider it like it's a hall
of fame of sorts or like legacy strains or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about impact and history than it
is about more plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and some of the ones with a lot
of legend around them that we've tried to
[SPEAKER_03]: crack over the years, like, for example,
chem dog, which, you know, is a very
[SPEAKER_03]: controversial strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of the ones that,
that took me some time and just thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about it, I figured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few ways on how to approach it,
because it's not one that I could just
[SPEAKER_03]: approach from.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we've seen in the plants from
my perspective and other, a few other
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't feel comfortable just doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one where I feel like it needs to
have all of the history with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The forum posts from chem dog himself,
from P bud, from JJ New York, from
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone that's been involved all the way
up the line, every last one of their
[SPEAKER_03]: quotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everyone can make, you know,
conclusions for themselves based on what
[SPEAKER_03]: these guys themselves said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, it helps put a lot into
perspective when you have all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it helps it also be a more valuable
historical resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's not just me telling you what I
think based on my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that can always be based on faith or
agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is me presenting all of, not just my
own conclusions, but here is all the data
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's their conclusions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the story that started with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's where I ended up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can, you can totally disregard
anything that I have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can absolutely believe that everything
you're reading in the forum posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there'll be up there for you to
read.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's more of where I want to
take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, chem dog was a perfect
scenario strain for something like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: where it was just like, what is,
what is presenting what I think enough or
[SPEAKER_03]: do I need to present stuff that I may not
necessarily even agree with all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I think it's important maybe to,
to, to present that too, uh, as,
[SPEAKER_03]: as complete as possible and not cherry
pick too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the important thing to point
out here is that like, to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as someone who works with, with data a lot
in my other life, um, information and
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering knowledge, it's a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's first and foremost a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this website can embody that
process, um, that's, that's really all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, I mean, not, not sorry,
not, that's not all, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's something that like can be
relied upon regardless of the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, if you can trust the
process, you know, at least that the
[SPEAKER_00]: information will be getting validated,
improved that there's someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually accountable for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can, you know, Matt's name for
better or worse is on those entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause another thing that's worth
saying as well, even though that's Matt's
[SPEAKER_00]: name, Matt is connected with a whole bunch
of people who he talks to a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So implicitly those people are there,
their names are not necessarily there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, Matt is definitely talking
to CSI about this stuff, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of many people that,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I'm talking to the people that I
highly respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not just my opinion on a lot of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the people who I respect and you
know, like taking their work and putting
[SPEAKER_03]: it on there and like, you know,
like I'm, I'm reaching out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them aren't on there because I'm
waiting for, you know, CSI to give me back
[SPEAKER_03]: some fricking input.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't want to put my, my data up
there because my, frankly, I like I on
[SPEAKER_03]: certain strains, maybe I don't even trust
my own experience with them because maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a specific clone from a dispensary
or a, or even maybe I got it from a source
[SPEAKER_03]: that's good, but maybe it's not as good as
his source and maybe he had a different
[SPEAKER_03]: experience, you know, and I'd rather,
rather that be up there because I trust
[SPEAKER_03]: his input more than mine based on just
obvious experience, you know, very obvious
[SPEAKER_03]: experience in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Matt, like ultimately you
also have the freedom to
[SPEAKER_00]: how would I put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have the freedom to like express
where they're conflicting perspectives,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think you probably have in some of
those entries written like this is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think, but some other people think this
and maybe it's, it's a good time for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually briefly outline like what you can
see on the entries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do that though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left a link to the chem dog one in
the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go and quickly look at it
while I'm saying this, but so the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you see, you can see the parents,
at least what we know of the parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the aliases, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: the various names this cut or line has
had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the children and a really
important thing that we added in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll come back to this anecdote later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of us covering, we added what we
call information certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for Matt to be like,
Hey, this is wild speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't, you know, take this with a
huge grain of, you know, a fistful of salt
[SPEAKER_00]: or on the other end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is like pretty damn certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm very confident in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a little rating just to
kind of indicate like, yeah, how certain
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is whether this is referring to a
line or cut, which I think is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important because often that's like very
blurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is this a line or is this an
individual plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, we've also listed like, some of the
people we know have either are holding or
[SPEAKER_00]: historically have been known to have held
these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a year of origin, region of
origin, just broad description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have, like I was saying
before, my early version of a phylos
[SPEAKER_00]: galaxy type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say that like, this is what
I'm most proud of and most embarrassed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you'll notice that you can kind of
zoom in on the immediate family,
[SPEAKER_00]: which works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you go to the extended family,
I like the whole tree, it gets pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be, that's going to be a
work in progress kind of thing.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will say, this is like one of those
things that it's been very hard for me as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as getting other people to be actual,
do the actual data entry is because when
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at a strain map and how you do it,
the logic behind it, like if I just put
[SPEAKER_03]: BLD of unknown origin, for example,
as a parent, and then linked all these to
[SPEAKER_03]: the parent, then we would have a bunch of
unrelated things linked to sisters and
[SPEAKER_03]: brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I realized everything needs its
own variable, but I have to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: remember in my head those variables so I
don't reuse those variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be clear, Matt's talking about
a situation where like, yeah, some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some, some famous plant we know we can
guess that the parent is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, some like a NLD BLD and in the
database that becomes its own entry that
[SPEAKER_00]: BLD or NLD, whatever it is generic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Matt's saying is that he has to
be careful not to actually assume that
[SPEAKER_00]: that represents the same individual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has to distinguish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unknown, I would just, I'm just making
it up off the top of my head, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, unknown BLD one, three, five unknown
BLD 27, you know, just to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kept separate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even when they're placeholders,
even when they're placeholders,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to be really clear that they are
separate placeholders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And trying to teach people my syntax of
like how I choose which variable in the
[SPEAKER_03]: name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been very hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's picked it up yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I think it's actually been like,
kind of, um, some people are like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, I'm not even going to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, because it is, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The logic of it is complicated and you
can't ever screw it up or the whole thing
[SPEAKER_03]: breaks in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, on, on that note,
you know, I should say we want as much
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback as we can get from people,
you know, um, one thing that I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: built yet that I really do want to build
that Matt and I discussed last week is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a little like comments feature at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can actually say what they think
on the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the current absence of that,
please obviously comment here,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit me or Matt up on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have anything to say about any of
the entries.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, last, last couple of things that
we have on the plant pages at the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: is a references section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea here is to link any other kind
of content, whether it's like a forum
[SPEAKER_00]: thread, a breed of syndrome, syndicate
episode, anything, anything we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: like try to flesh those references out
again, work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but slowly, um, I think every page
will become like a nice little hub of
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of information and
references.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's great pictures of Kim one
through four, which are very hard to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so it's a quick reference on stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean where we have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, was there anything else we wanted to
say about what we do have there,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, otherwise I wanted to move on to
like things that I could see coming as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, I think it's very, um,
very much what we just said.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we haven't even said where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we'll, we'll put a link in the
description, but I'll say the website is
[SPEAKER_00]: codex.thebreedersyndicate.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So codex.thebreedersyndicate.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not been properly indexed on
Google yet, but I imagine once we start
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing the links out and people,
more people share them, um, down to Google
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I've been, I've been a little hesitant
to put it out because for me, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to be as complete as possible,
but realistically with everything going
[SPEAKER_03]: on, like the ability to constantly add to
it's been taken away from time to time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I, it's, it's pretty good and we
need to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, uh, I think I'm good with
adding it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what Matt's saying, please be
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be gentle if you can, um,
with your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is still very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like Matt's saying, and like I said,
you know, keep implying, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep saying it's a process and for any
process like this, the more feedback we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get, the better it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we'll have more feedback
mechanisms available on the app itself
[SPEAKER_00]: soon, but otherwise just reach out to us
in whatever way you want, comment on this
[SPEAKER_00]: video, um, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, I'm really on a ramble this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I've got a lot to say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and there's sort of gestures towards
future stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of had a possible idea that like
other people could also use this for
[SPEAKER_00]: adding their own entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I E if you're a breeder or, you know,
seed maker or whatever hobbyist and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to like map, you know, some,
for some family of relationships,
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about opening it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that that in itself
introduces a whole bunch of new possible
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like should those entries go into the main
like hall of fame section?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we keep people's data like
separate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be private?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't really moved on it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can guess that it would be
popular and that it, it would get some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uptake, but I would think
personally, I think just thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: it, like it would be cool if people could
have it as a separate and public thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that they could share if they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, only because I was thinking back to a
seed finder, like if they would have had
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, like that would have
been really cool, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: would have served the purpose,
but you know, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think that's not a bad
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of see like two different
downstream, like implementation
[SPEAKER_00]: implementations of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is like, we extend what we have,
which I, I have tried a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we have had people come on already
and I've tried to be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we can just let them add stuff to
the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Page, but it doesn't go into the hall of
fame, but there has other complications.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other possibility is I basically make
an alternative version of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where I rip obviously most of the
code, but I change it slightly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difficulty here, I think for me is
that the problem with software is that
[SPEAKER_00]: once you have it up and you're saying that
other people can join and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintenance costs and risks can kind of
like really blow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's hard to know whether
or not we have the, the capacity to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keep building and maintaining
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that like what we've started
with is already pretty ambitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how this all unfolds and how
the kind of interest that we might get.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is there to say about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's much else,
you know, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, just that, you know, like we do want
to be inclusive with it eventually,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, like to start out,
it has to be a certain way to establish
[SPEAKER_03]: the baselines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of this is just simply me doing
data entry from old catalogs that I have
[SPEAKER_03]: to, um, some of it is stuff like me
getting, you know, pictures of Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting all the info on all the data
from everybody I know that's reliable when
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes to Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enter all that in, you know, each one,
um, you know, as it relates to like
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry go enter everything in every
step of the way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not incomplete.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it never runs into a wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of little things like
that, um, that I wanted to do to get it
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've done a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, there's not, it's not one
big agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be a historical
resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, when we first talked about
it, there was a lot of backlash from
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it was, some of it was legitimate
and some of it was just like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it didn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I think there's a lot of
perception on how people think it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be handled and how people think it
might turn out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realistically, um, I think a lot of
people had a lot of perceptions about how
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeder Syndicate was going to turn out
what the agenda was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm interested to see how, uh,
this unfolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say this to add a bit of,
uh, add a bit of drama and a bit of spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't obviously go into the details,
but I, early on while I was developing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I had a little, at the time of
fairly small Instagram following,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I decided to take a screenshot of one
of the pages and just put it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't because necessarily of the
information on the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to show what the website was
looking like at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, uh, some people got
really offended by it and like it caused a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a, yeah, a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I was just like, Oh my God,
it was my first taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of like the kinds of why
considered to be quite petty drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can arise in this, uh, world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I expect that we will have,
we'll probably see more of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just one picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the whole site.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also when we did add the
information certainty rating to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt, actually that's a reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably need to go through and add
those to various entries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, get that, that ice covering it should
be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't want it to relay that little
anecdote just to just so people have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of like some of the dramas that have
occurred and probably will, will occur
[SPEAKER_00]: once now that we're launching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I invite it like, you know,
like I don't, I don't necessarily invite
[SPEAKER_03]: drama.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nobody wants to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even my dumb ass doesn't, that goes with
it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, he doesn't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I do invite criticism and I do
invite people that have better knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: than me to give me their input.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that isn't to say that like,
just because you think your knowledge is
[SPEAKER_03]: better that I'm going to agree,
but it does also doesn't mean that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to disagree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd be surprised even sometimes I'm
surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so feel free to reach out,
comment below, you know, hit me up on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram and or discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be clear, I'm not trying to incite
drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would hope to see not as much drama,
but I'm expecting some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I, I'm not scared of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I don't know if I have anything
else to say about it for now, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm just excited for this to
actually be visible and be accessible to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is really just the first step,
you know, in the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll help light a fire under me to
keep, uh, keep raging on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: See where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt's going to like have to add some
filters to his inbox soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, do you have anything else you want to
add?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, uh, again, we'll, we'll put the link
in the description, but it's codex
[SPEAKER_00]: .thebreedascendicate.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I said, give us feedback on any
of the social media platforms,
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and again, shout out to, I didn't,
right here, right here, I'm going to put
[SPEAKER_03]: the link right under here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know how to do that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, one thing in, in talking about the
process that I didn't get to say is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, thank you so much to Anadar and
Quasir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as a developer, I can, I'm not so
good at like fine details, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to do with the aesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, I want the data stuff to be
good, you know, all the functionality to
[SPEAKER_00]: be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two really, really, really helped
make it look, um, a lot better,
[SPEAKER_00]: polish it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, they were an immense kind of
help to me when I was like driving on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, apologize to you, I didn't give you
guys a fucking chance to really get much
[SPEAKER_00]: else in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was just going so fast,
but yeah, thank you so much for your
[SPEAKER_00]: support and like you work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys worked really well together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was insane to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how well you guys all like
streamlined together, like boom,
[SPEAKER_03]: boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually people are arguing or bickering
for top spot, but everybody was just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I got to see, there was like
three fairly senior professionals like
[SPEAKER_00]: together and that was rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did not expect to get other people
to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's, uh, you got anything else
you want to get in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, that, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just excited to see what happens once,
uh, this episode goes live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very excited to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very excited to see where it goes.
