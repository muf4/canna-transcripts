[SPEAKER_01]: Alright,
[SPEAKER_02]: back inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my neighbors were looking at me
fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet they thought I was just taking a
selfie with Mr. Murray here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh dang, he's going to lock
it up with Murray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we can get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty dark in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's get to some real questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something worthwhile, something worth
putting out there.
There
[SPEAKER_02]: we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, hit me with some questions,
fellas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's JJ New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bring him in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still says connecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't connected yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, JJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, your phone has a lag with the audio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can move into a better
spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, get by an internet connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: That always works the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dealing with the normal shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's a couple of things I
wanted to talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One being the Jeezel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeezel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jeezel is super scum, can't be,
to my knowledge.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stated it was super skunk,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a super skunk S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know because there's no Chem D
coming out of the progeny at all in any of
[SPEAKER_02]: the S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my knowledge, that came out of a Chem D
mother, though, a Chem D flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told by Greg that it came out of the
super skunk flower that the Chem D hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was told the opposite,
but maybe...
[SPEAKER_02]: Either one of us could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg didn't keep good notes, as we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's coming from those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and the Weasel both, you could ask the
same question twice and get two different
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fact, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you grown the mass super skunk
ever?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I have never grown mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with the speculation that the mass
super skunk is with the sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of have a couple of discrepancies
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the mass super skunk, if you ever
grown it, it grows kind of medium height,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a single cola with a very thick
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so the theory that it would be
part of the Chem Dog, with the Chem Dog
[SPEAKER_00]: making the sour diesel, the growth
structure is just way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've grown Chem 91 next to sour
diesel, the sativa growth on the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel is just... If you've grown it,
I don't have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's night and day for Chem 91,
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the theory of the super skunk went
into it, then where does all that sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: growth come from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, unless it's a recessive trait,
but I kind of disagree with that because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown the DNL that I think that...
[SPEAKER_00]: Is part of the sour diesel, and it grows
exactly the same, just that really
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to top it off and just branch it
out and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just my view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with some of your DDNL,
and I saw a lot of sour traits in it as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to ask you that because I
thought a while back that you had grown
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those DNL crosses and I wanted to
get your... I thought it was dank,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still sitting on some beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't brought them out in a long time,
but I got so many different things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to try to get into it soon,
especially with all this skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: controversies that are going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's speaking of controversies over
this whole thing with fucking giraffe
[SPEAKER_00]: neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick neck, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I was skunked VA, I would have
just ripped his head off right there on
[SPEAKER_00]: the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised he didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude is just like a mellow dude,
and he's the kind of dude that once he
[SPEAKER_00]: snaps, there's no stopping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's got... His arms are the size
of my thighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a wrestler.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like a... You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like... I couldn't believe what... Joint
Brett told him to suck his dick or
[SPEAKER_02]: something online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he went up to his booth and they
had some kind of conversation and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: came outside and I was in a circle with
the Swamp Boys and Bronson was there and
[SPEAKER_00]: he just like fucked and lost his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I thought I was going to have to
fight him at first, but then I became like
[SPEAKER_00]: his therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I kind of had like a shred of
sympathy for the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was saying he went to jail and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone hates him and how he wants to be
accepted and all this other bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were the voice of reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you're swinging on people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him, listen, stop fronting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, you're...
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you my honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him, I'm like, hey,
listen, if you had something that great,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would congratulate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're just thinking that
everyone's saying shit to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving you my honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone that I talked to that was in
that expo that saw that stuff was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like...
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought it to Emerald Cup too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was... And the people that touched
the underside of the jar got some orange
[SPEAKER_02]: shit on their fingers that smelled like
real snunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't have any of that going on,
but... Poor fella.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's charting in dangerous territories,
fucking around with Duke and Skunky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either one of those dudes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens at the next show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it boil over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, but, you know, in there,
and then there's all these other guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, were, you know,
safe to have the road kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the original super scum back in
like 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me tell you, when you just crack
that jaw or just permeated, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I had gotten to cut years later,
it was just, it just wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't give out those same kind of
jokes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different cut or the...
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, cuts just dug out
after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's starting to happen with the sour
diesel, because everyone asked me,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, where's that, where's that sour diesel
at, you know, with that old time sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to figure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how long that cut is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's just been given, you know,
from person to person, from room to room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, cuts adapt to the
room that they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, your sour diesel is going to
come out different than my sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start giving out cuts and I start
giving out cuts, you know, after a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there could be, you know,
some type of genetic drift that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, might happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anything drastically, but,
you know, there's, there seems to be these
[SPEAKER_00]: small, subtle things that seem to be
missing from the sour nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, acclimates from room to room to
room to room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that thing's so fucking old.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've had, we had, you know,
the original underdog, which was super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk and now times a 91, it just went bad
on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had the cut and then after a
while it just, it only showed glimmers of
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, you know, when it was really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was still, you know, the,
um, the hardest went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was harder to clone and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a while, my phone was like,
he gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a little bit of work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my phone was like, listen,
I'm just going to let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've heard, and I remember just buying
from buying weed, there was this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: called the wheelchair, the wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, that shit,
you know, was giving me bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the same thing after a while,
you just could not get the same batches
[SPEAKER_00]: just from buying it after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same people were growing it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's the wheelchair?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just some type of, um, local,
um, strain that was sold to New York city
[SPEAKER_00]: in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back then we didn't really have,
uh, you know, names weren't really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the thing that they are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I have no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've seen, I think I've seen some
stuff referenced like as the wheelchair or
[SPEAKER_00]: the Crippler or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to have to really find out
a, you know, where that really came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that, you know, that stuff
came from Amsterdam back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about I-95.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the other one that I wanted
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the history of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, that's a Money Mike strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And originally he bred that back in like
2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought it to the Denver Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last Denver Cup was 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, and we brought that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, um, it was, uh, legend star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male times, uh, the triangle coach.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he bred that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we were friends with Tara Rojo and
we went over to mindful and he gave us a
[SPEAKER_00]: tour and, you know, and so we gave him
some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him some store dog seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some I-95 seeds and, you know,
we, you know, we're just trying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to help the guy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, going further back,
he had invited us to share his booth in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the first few Denver Cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've been 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, we, you know,
I always, you know, respected Phil and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, thank him for, you know,
helping us and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we gave him seeds to,
you know, deploy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play with and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so, you know, he grew those seeds
out and then see, this is where it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: getting kind of fudgy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I confronted him, you know,
he says, you know, that he had started the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and left mine full or I'm not really
sure, but we gave the seeds to Phil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then before we know it, uh,
one of his workers, uh, Matt Ross,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, started a seed company basically with
the seeds that we gave Phil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Phil, Phil claimed that he,
he stole them from mine full, took them
[SPEAKER_00]: out and started playing with them at his
house and all, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we held us Phil responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he claims that, but, you know,
he, uh, like he hired the same guy to run,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, some kind of, you know, get some kind
of job in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, I think that, you know,
he kind of set him up to kind of be the
[SPEAKER_00]: bad guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while Phil spread those genetics all
through his, his, um, his, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: his dealings with eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's got the egrets thing and he
does, you know, other smaller stuff on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, I know he, you know,
he got some stuff in Baltimore and
[SPEAKER_00]: Maryland and Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if those are a bridge
related or not, but I do know they're
[SPEAKER_00]: running the I-95 Kennedy that those guys
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and then, you know, so,
you know, they, they, they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had, uh, elite, the elite
guys, which those guys are friends of
[SPEAKER_00]: ours.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good friends of mine too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they, you know,
they took a pack of I-95 and did,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they bought them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but then, you know, they saw what,
uh, what these guys did with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, and they started doing the same
crosses that they, but they didn't sell
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't sell them, but they were
giving them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just even doing, giving them away,
you're trying to like make a name for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and the way that I look at it is
if, you know, if you bought, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: given a pack of I-95, can be, you think
you're ever, ever going to buy one from
[SPEAKER_00]: me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the chances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys ever release the I-95 Kennedy
or the I-95 publicly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't know that because yes,
I'm selling them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody go grab your I-95 Kim D from
JJ top dog seeds right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically I took, um, you know,
I took F twos from them guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, I mean, not F well,
they gave me F ones and I made F twos with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I started, um, crossing into some
of the different other strains and then
[SPEAKER_00]: money Mike also, uh, did a remake of his,
uh, uh, I-95 into the chem D and made the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem, chem, uh, the D-95s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as money Mike's take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike's design is just an F two on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took their, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took their original that,
um, chem deli, uh, chem that, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the chem D, um, the chem D meaning,
uh, she, you know, it was the one that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I F two that, that, that I had
gotten, but I had, they had, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I went over there with, with those and
went after Phil left and I, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, uh, Matt and his brother,
uh, Jackson both gave, gave me seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me buds, tell me, told me how much
they loved me, you know, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then he went around and did
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then wave gem did the same exact
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came up to our booth in Boston and
told us how much they loved us and blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And money Mike wanted to punch the guy out
because he was playing around with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with, with, you know, he, he was getting
into dangerous, uh, territory at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him, yo, you better just back
off and, you know, I mean, you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and then he got all stupid and did
the same thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so everyone tells you that they
love you, how much they respect you,
[SPEAKER_00]: this and that come and kiss your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get your gear and they want to be
like you and they just go in and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just try to copy all the work
that you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it just seems to be a,
uh, you know, a common trait, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different world.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least on the forums, like people would
get called out all the time by a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, now, you know, it's just as
easy to, you know, you just block someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no one really, you know, has the
respect or the decency anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in the day, it was a lot
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of that wave gen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a new company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just some, some guys, I think there
were some kid that was out of Rhode Island
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's up there in Maine now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep my eye out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you a wave or your wave gem
or gem, your wave gem genetics or,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, he's changed his name a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gotten deleted, you know,
and then you got green point another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, then he, he took the I-95.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the store dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wave, wave genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wave genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Hey, I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of people don't know what DNL is
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you go over it for people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as far as I know, the DNL originally
originated was the RFK skunk, which the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, um, the weasel Mike and Gabby went
down to a dead show at RFK and scored a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of a kind bud and found, I don't know,
like eight or 10 seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, they both agreed to split the
seeds and when they did it, they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: put all the seeds out on the table and
they, it's one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, when the weasel, um, and he wound
up, um, getting, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like three different phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I first met him in central
park.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, he was skunk one, skunk two,
skunk three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he called them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, a friend of his,
uh, wound up getting like some type of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, some NL seeds and some Hawaiian seeds
that, uh, he wound up having those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and he gave him, uh, one of some of those,
uh, RFK clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he made his own stream,
like combining the three and he just
[SPEAKER_00]: called it the NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it might've had some L and
L in it, but it was mostly sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in structure, you know, and the
Hawaiian, it kind of had these tropical,
[SPEAKER_00]: like tropical stunky tones a little bit,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, you get, you get little bits,
you know, you can taste in a sour
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, so that was a strain
that he grew exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that he gave it back to,
uh, the weasel to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's what, what I suspect
was in the room when, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those, uh, seeds were made originally,
weren't made, but were found originally in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 91 because, I mean, I, you know,
I used to sell weed for the weasel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew it, I sold it, but he had,
he had Vondo and there were a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were, that would weasel in and
try to, uh, to buy, to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was, it was like a race because I
would, you know, he would only get like a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, you know, you just had to
grab everything that he had at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: just cash him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this way you had control of all of
that because you know, back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: people would just come in and just want to
buy it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be like, I can't sell it to
you all because, you know, I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread it out and I would sell it to other
people that did me favors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I get something in,
you know, I'll hit you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make some money, just do me a
favor, you know, get me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you save me, you know, this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could use it as like a
bartering tool, to, you know, get other
[SPEAKER_00]: favors from people.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, do you know if the RFK is still
around or is that long gone?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's been long gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really recently they lost the DNL
within the last like two years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I mean, that's why I was thinking
about trying to, you know, fall back on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those seeds I've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see if I could pull anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be real cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, I wanted to try to reverse
that into the 91 and see what would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because when I first started
growing in like 99, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I had been selling wheat for a
long time and anytime I had some,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that was super killing,
I found seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would save them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at one time I had a, you know,
a really bad ass collection from the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wound up starting a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so when I started that one,
when I started getting the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, every once in a while,
you might find a seed or two in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would save them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I started, I popped a few of
those seeds and really back then there was
[SPEAKER_00]: no really such thing as the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, looking back, I had found
some stuff that was very sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: like very sourish, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I had, I had, something
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we were, we had closed down a
grow or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had just popped these seeds and I
sexed them and I gave them and I gave the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone to my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, listen, I was like,
I said, the only thing I know that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, came from out of the chem
dog and it's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave it to him and he grew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that became the guava, but not the
guava of today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, so he called that cut the guava.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of very sourish and all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ran it and then eventually lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years later, I wound up doing the
star dog and I had gifted my friend some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to give to Andre Grossman,
the photographer of High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he grew them out and he found a
phenom that was today's guava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened was somehow, while he,
well, what happened was they liked that
[SPEAKER_00]: cut so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time they had, at High Times,
they had the Kyle Cushman strawberry claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually had, they had a plant in
the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like anyone that went into the office,
if they liked you enough, they would cut
[SPEAKER_00]: you a couple clones right off the plant in
the office and let you go home with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so eventually the same thing happened
with the guava.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both the guava and the strawberry claw
became the office strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So years later, like I was saying,
the same guy that named the guava tells me
[SPEAKER_00]: that he got the guava, he got the guava
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eventually find out that it comes
full circle back from the High Times guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that was how, you know,
the guava kind of got its name of today
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was originally some type of a sour,
chem, something, the original cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember it and it was very sour,
diesel-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think, well, I didn't get to
ever finish it out actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of them I did and then another
one I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I did get to finish one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I had popped another seed and
that was the seed that I gave my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it came from the same batch though of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, was the Stardog guava similar in
terms or anything to the other guava?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the guava of today is more chem
four-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the chem four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the other one was more kind of
91-ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more fuel-y, a little more
fuel-y, sour-y fuel-y the original one
[SPEAKER_02]: was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still have any of those old,
the purple Afghan cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did a purple Stardog with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a purple Stardog with what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was British Empire's purple
Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really, I never popped any of
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, I'm sitting on them and I think I
did some into the Chem D also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I did some into the original
Hayes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those all could be real, that Afghan
original Hayes could be fucking real
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wound up flowering out some of that
stuff and some of it was green and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: it was purple just by genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wound up using a male and I fucked
up and never made F2s out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have that, just the crosses into
the Stardog and the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be fascinating to see pop
back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the purple Stardog that I made,
the purple came from the trade dog male
[SPEAKER_00]: and the purple probably came from the
Afghan and that Afghan was a Sensei seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old Afghani one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan one, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, looking back into that,
that wasn't really like a true,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar as in one strain, I think it was
a mix of their best Afghanis or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like looking back into the maple
leaf, I think even like the maple leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: really wasn't really like one stable
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were a variety of different
females in there, because if you look back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the seed bank catalog, they actually
offer that, like a 50 pack or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more of like a breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounded like there was a lot of
different varieties in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one guy that they talk about,
maple leaf, whoever they called one guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: maple leaf, was the phenos that he was
growing at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess all that was based off his
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've always found that a lot of
the stuff that was listed as maple leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: indica, like that was used, tend to look
like Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if they have similar
parentage that way back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, because I look back and
I think, you know, if you look into the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalogs on the Afghani one, it says it's
like a mix of their three or four best
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanis or whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I grew it, it kind of grew very
fast and single cola, kind of short,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't really have a really,
the turps on it weren't really super
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I figured it would be a
good out cross to go and cross into the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem because it wouldn't be dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it kind of had like a kind of a
medicine, a little medicine thing going
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I smoked the flower, but you know,
it wasn't anything that would compare to
[SPEAKER_00]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the structure, you know, definitely
added you know, because it gave you that
[SPEAKER_00]: really thick stem, you know, and all the,
all the, the calyx, the blood ratio,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there wasn't much leaf on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were, you know, you're one of the
first guys I saw from not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_02]: modern era, but prior to the modern era
that was actually using like the Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights, the super skunks, the Afghani one,
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that always inspired me to go in that
direction for those baselines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was always a big San Tisi fan back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, their genetics are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, but if you're looking back,
most of that stuff they got from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, stuff was seed bank stuff that,
you know, when Neville was in jail and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they bailed him out and,
you know, they gave him money or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty sure that that was the story
behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best stuff there is as far as
baselines go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if people don't grow that stuff,
they won't have an idea of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: traits and modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're, they're, they don't have a
good base knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and looking back, like, I know
people, you know, that have talked to the
[SPEAKER_00]: drunkards and they admitted that they've
lost all their mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, someone like Adam Dunn,
he was working in with them back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he knows firsthand a lot of that
stuff that went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, he, he, you know,
he left after he left.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then I don't know who else
was doing, I don't know who else was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: their breathing back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, because you used to be able
to get those cellophane cord pads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they upgraded to the box with the
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the box and the bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff was junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leading up, leading up until today,
because my friend, he had bought a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Carrere, like, you know, the year it
won the cup or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he grew it out,
you know, I was selling the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a while, they did this kind of,
people got, sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, they told him to stop
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have the whole pack left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, years later, I said,
hey, why don't you look for that pack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so then I was able to grab a pack
of the boxes and I gave him a pack of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Carrere and he grew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was, it wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was really, it was junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think really by then
that's when a lot of people started
[SPEAKER_00]: outsourcing to what?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff comes back,
you know, it's kind of like Jackie,
[SPEAKER_00]: they got the Jack Turk to it, but it's,
you know, it grows very sativa like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, it's kind of wispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I don't know, I just call it
like generic Amsterdam weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like even like Adam says, you know,
like the Jack itself is like, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, like a 12 way cross or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four things that just cross back
into each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a while, it just becomes like,
you know, a genetic mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it just comes, it's just very
generic in, in what it's producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes a muddled mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it looks like we've got a minute left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to get in,
my man?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got into pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised we're able to squeeze it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, it's a pleasure having you on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're one of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we were able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I go over these things and just,
you know, iron out some of the confusion
[SPEAKER_00]: that might've been out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk soon, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
Thank you.
