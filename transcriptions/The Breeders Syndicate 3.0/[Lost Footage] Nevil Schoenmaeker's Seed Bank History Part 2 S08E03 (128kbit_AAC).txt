[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to assume that we're
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breed or Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to go and talk about the
sequel to what we were discussing last
[SPEAKER_02]: episode, which was the early years of the
Dutch seed bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, kind of last year we,
or last time, so to speak, we chatted a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about how they got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chatted about Neville and all that,
and we kind of took us, took everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: through like the first three or four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see that there's a bunch of
cool questions this week that have already
[SPEAKER_00]: popped up, so we'll get to that in a
little bit, but we're going to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: start on, we're going to kind of start and
take you guys through like the last,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, like 10 years or so of Neville's
influence and kind of his history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we got a bunch of notes and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hold up some stuff on occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you guys some ideas,
all that, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, probably the easiest way to
start is to say that in 1998, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of when Neville had been in business,
like three years or so, and that's when he
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of started to sort out like favorites
amongst what he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had had to, he'd collected a number of
cuttings from America by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: He dealt with a bunch of breeders by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had bred with a number of these things
for three or four years in some cases at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point, and that's where his
collection started to go from sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hodgepodge grab bag of things to more of
the famous stuff that we all became
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with when we started getting into
weed history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights One, Northern Lights Two,
G13, you know, Hash Plant, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: NL Hazes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, 88 to 90 is kind of really when people
are probably like more familiar with that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he'd, you know, he'd sort of
settled on what worked for him,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where before he'd been just kind of
playing around with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really didn't know what he'd had.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had sent him stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd bought things off various folks and
he, you know, but these are just names to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: To us, you get NL, you get Maple Leaf,
you get Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all means something because there's a
lot of history behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably to him, there was just a lot
of, they were just literally names from
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, early on, he was sourcing a lot of
seeds and later on, and over those three
[SPEAKER_02]: years, he became a breeder as opposed to
just sourcing and passing on genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually started working lines,
which is where these amazing lines come
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he had done a bunch of breeding
and he sort of figured out what was an
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistent pain in the ass, for lack of
a better term, and what was consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Neville was always, he was
always sensitive to what people wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he wanted to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to make people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people weren't happy a lot of times
with incredibly variable stuff that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: perform well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, you know, he had started to
figure out what males were good to use
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What females were champs and bred well
with lots of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to start kind of,
you know, walking through some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, which one do you want to start with
first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should start with, we kind of
talked a lot about Northern Lights last
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably one of the things that
we expounded upon the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we could chat about, because 1988
is when things dramatically changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that regard, from 85 to 87,
he just sort of sold a variety of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids of Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of got, you just bought
straight NL, Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a grab bag of all the different
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by, by 88, he had decided that there
was two lines that really made the most
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL1 and NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL1 was sort of like a broadleaf Afghan,
possibly you could call it a bubba type,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, widely frosty golf ball type,
you know, nugs, almost maybe slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was probably one of his most
consistent lines he had because he took
[SPEAKER_00]: all the Northern Lights and he bred them
together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 88, he offered what was called
NL1 F3 and NL2 F3.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could put these up on the screen,
but I can't because I don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just have to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just have to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so basically, you know, those two
things, they became, and we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more later, but these kind of
became like mainstays in cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They became permanent additions,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as that, as well as offering them
pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's figure he gets them in 84.
[SPEAKER_00]: He starts messing around with them in
85-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 88, he'd had, you know, three years of
having them, he'd taken them to F3,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was releasing them as a more
consistent variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 88 is the first year that those two
things pop up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the first year that you
start seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to offering both of those
strains as straight itself, you start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing NL2 and NL1 being used as breeding
males in all kinds of stuff that he had,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: NL1, there's probably nothing that he used
as much as a breeding male as NL1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the biggest focus on the company
as a male overall, looking back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can look at stuff and,
you know, he, a lot of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the stuff that he had,
you know, that he got his cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, like hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash plant, he first offered his hash
plant by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets big bud as a cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offers it as big bud by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he gets a variety of things and
he starts crossing it by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: 88 is interesting too, because,
you know, he had gotten these old haze
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from Sam Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition to some other people in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 88 is the first year that any kind of
haze hybrid pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one that maybe a lot of people
haven't heard of, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's haze by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was only offered for one year,
but what's unique about it is that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other haze hybrids he offered used haze as
a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually was a female that he found
that he called haze beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this one year where all this
sudden you could get haze B by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of all things, it was NL1 ruderalis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first time that haze pops up
that I'm aware of in a catalog in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was because he hadn't settled on,
he hadn't, you know, he was still
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting a little bit, but he'd
figured out some things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He had also, he'd gone to America and he
had acquired through Jorge Cervantes'
[SPEAKER_00]: connections in the Pacific Northwest,
in the Oregon, Washington area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge had hooked him up with some unknown
growers and those unknown growers gave him
[SPEAKER_00]: G13 and what became known as the Pacific
Northwest Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those things ended up getting used
pretty extensively in future years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he, he also, I don't know
if, I don't know if Matt can show it or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, but he, the 87 update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have, you don't have,
you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he offered this 87 update.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that was cool about
Navel is that he, he gave a lot more data
[SPEAKER_00]: on what the hell he was doing versus most
other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was extensive, especially in that 87
update.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really like more data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most growers back then would have even
given a fuck about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he lays it out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he, he starts talking about
it and he talks about basically both the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Plant and the Big Bud that he crossed
to NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he took that and he back crossed
it, mails of that back to the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how he became, that's how
Big Bud and Hash Plant actually got
[SPEAKER_00]: offered is as separate strains is he used
NL1 to BX them for, you know, he,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, so they're actually, you know,
he never had seed lines of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and he lays out in like extensive
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't show it to you on the screen right
now, but he kind of lays out like his,
[SPEAKER_00]: like step by step, how he figured it out,
what kind of, he knows we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, what you could look for all that
type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when 88 is when,
a lot of, that's when a lot of the famous
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that we all know of really pops up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The G13 Hash Plant I think pops up that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it, you know, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, he, you know,
he found some of these, some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica strains, these, you know,
he, some of these Indica strains were a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more consistent than what he was
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you find consistency,
you start crossing them to different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and you start you know,
you start getting these various hybrids of
[SPEAKER_00]: such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 8990 is really when like he
solidified the sort of the lineup as it
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that lineup ended up staying pretty
consistent in the seed bank catalog and
[SPEAKER_00]: even going into Sensei, a lot of that
stuff ended up getting ported over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could kind of look at it and if
you're thinking about it in that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say probably by the late 80s,
probably the three most consistent females
[SPEAKER_00]: that he used were NL5, G13, and Hash
Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were sort of the three most common
Indicas that he would use as standard
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the PNW Hash Plant cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still looks very similar too.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all these years, they still look
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be, to be perfectly honest about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the, by modern standards, not
particularly pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as males go, by 8990,
you would say that the, the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: males he used was, like I said before,
was certainly NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also used NL2 a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in, you know, he, you had
Northern Lights 5 by Northern Lights 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had G13 by NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had Northern, you had all kinds of stuff
by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian Indica was by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Bud was by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash Plant was by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Haze I spoke about was by NL1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer one quick question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it coming on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about the Airborne and the
Pacific G13 cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a little hazy, but it's most
likely they're not pure G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're most likely a G13 by NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that would be Feno popping out of the
seeds that Airborne popped from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pacific is a lot different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one, that one is a lot, has a lot
more of a cloudy history.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know the breeders that offered it and
stuff, but it never quite panned out the
[SPEAKER_02]: same as Airborne as far as producing
quality and stuff similar to G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then aside from NL1 and NL2,
the other probably two most common males
[SPEAKER_00]: that he used by, you know, 8990 would have
been the Haze male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which Haze male?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Haze C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze C.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, you know, the Haze story, it's
probably, we could probably talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could brush up on it, brush on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could brush on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sam Skunkman flees America and he comes
over to Europe and he's trying to get set
[SPEAKER_00]: up and he has Skunk 1 and Haze seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from Mel Frank, he has Durban
Poison and Afghani 1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a couple other seed lines that
he collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: California Orange, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: California Orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was from Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, was that from Rob?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a number of things, you know,
he had a number of things from Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob followed him out later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early Pearl, early girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early girl, the you know, the Pearl
stuff, early Pearl, some of the Mexicans
[SPEAKER_00]: that Neville offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were from Sam initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were from, sourced by Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were from Rob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so Sam ended up coming over,
Sam ended up coming over to Europe first
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of brought a hodgepodge of various
collectors and people's lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so, you know, there's,
there's a, there's a debate between,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it's not a debate anymore because
Neville's passed, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a long debate that was
likely never to be solved where Sam has a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of stories about the early Haze and
how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville has his own stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be an entire podcast in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But suffice to say that when Sam came over
to Europe, he sold some Haze seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold some Haze seeds to the founder of
SSSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave some to the owner of Positronix
and maybe someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a few people, at least three
people are documented to have gotten stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: from Sam, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When he came over, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's been pretty well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Haze, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Sam, so Neville, Neville, Neville's
story just real quick is they were a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cracked a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them did not pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, the first female he got,
he unfortunately killed because it never
[SPEAKER_00]: finished flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got another female, which is the bee,
which I spoke about, which I spoke about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier as being the first actual release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what really became famous is he got
two males, which he called A and C,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, A got- You're kind of clipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your audio's clipping a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're there, but I mean,
it's like it's hitting high points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better now?
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got two males, A and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both ended up becoming kind of
famous, C much more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he crossed the A to basically
everything, every good indica he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made a mistake with his workers in
89 and he lost the male early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he never sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never sold any commercial seed of A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody that gets an L5 haze or any
of that other kind of haze crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: silver haze, all that, it's all using the
C male because that's the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And strangely, it seems like Neville had
more success finding fire in the haze
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that he got than other people did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean- And it sounds like he had 10 seeds
total is what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he- So there's debate in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a camp that believes that he
got similar things to everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just had better indicas to cross
them to than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another camp that thinks that
Neville claimed that Sam sold him old
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that he said would have a low
germination rate that were from 69 to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that maybe Sam when he first got there
sold some original stuff before he did his
[SPEAKER_00]: open pollinations in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that got a hold of that
original first batch of haze that he
[SPEAKER_00]: brought over with him got better quality
haze than people did later on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really a debate that we can solve
being that it's two dudes from 1984 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 1985.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have all three guys that he-
Well, Neville and the guy from SSSC and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Positronix gentlemen, they all agree
that they got haze seed from Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same year, same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same bag, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know we have documentation from
others that it certainly happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when by 89-90, that's when
all the famous stuff you start hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: about, which is NL5 by Skunk1,
NL5 by 2, G13 by NL2, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5 by- I think NL5 by haze was actually
released via catalog, not until 89-90.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a pretty picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just looking earlier and it's NL5
and I think it's a much prettier picture
[SPEAKER_02]: than on the back of a lot of the catalogs
that they show where it's just like a
[SPEAKER_02]: jumbled up close shot of some kind of
frosty leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is a much better- I think it
gives a much better picture of the bud
[SPEAKER_02]: structure, overall growth patterns and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really interesting because
that's the famous NL5 cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer a quick question just because
I was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just asked where is Tom Hill's
haze fits in.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I would say that Matt knows
a bit more about that than I, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that Tom Hill got his haze stock
from Positronix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the old Positronix haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if- I think it's the old
Positronix haze 19 based on all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where Tom Hill's haze comes from
one of the, you know, one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: people that gave haze to Positronix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lost my train of thought for a second
answering that question, but the NL5 that
[SPEAKER_00]: he was just holding up, maybe we can talk
about that for a second because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville, we were talking about on the
previous podcast how there was always two
[SPEAKER_00]: famous cuttings of NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the interview that Matt did with Greg
Seattle, Greg of Northern Lights fame,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said that he got a cutting of NL5 and
it was from his friend Herbie who had
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy's Afghan and crossed it to a
Colombian Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the cutting that he sent
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville claims he got that cut and he
didn't like it very much compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that he found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's story is that he popped a bunch
of NL5 seed lines because that's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines he got from Greg and most of it
was an Indica sativa hybrid mess that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't particularly useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he got this one plant that was what he
called the throwback plant that looked
[SPEAKER_00]: pure Afghan and had no influence of sativa
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you see this short stocky,
dense, budded, frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that picture I would say leads up to
Neville's story being correct and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: having some truth to it because I would
look at that thing and I would not say it
[SPEAKER_00]: had any Colombian or Mexican influence.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would instantly say that looks pure
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would look like a pure Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean that right there,
that's the famous NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the famous cutting that got crossed
the haze, that got crossed the skunk one,
[SPEAKER_00]: that got crossed in Northern Lights too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really you know, we mentioned it
before, but there was never a pure seed
[SPEAKER_00]: line of NL5 offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only hybrids offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's the cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That discusses NL5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to go into maple leaf Indica,
the big bud, stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we cover that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we covered that too,
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, wait one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to do something with Murray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and start talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically once he found that NL5
cutting, like I said before, that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: he started crossing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became one of his standards in the
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he crossed it to skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became an extremely famous strain,
NL5 by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5 haze is probably the most famous line
he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5 by two is also super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, NL5, G13, hash plant,
those became sort of his standard Indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: His best producing females, skunk one,
haze, NL2 and NL1 became his most common
[SPEAKER_00]: males that he used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he offered, obviously, he never
offered a pure NL5 line or a pure haze
[SPEAKER_00]: line, but he did offer pure NL1,
pure NL2, pure skunk one, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never got to ask him why,
the why of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't you ever offer haze pure or NL5
pure?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think part of the reason why
he never offered haze pure is because he
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed up early on and he lost too much
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked about later on wishing that he
could cross the, that he would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to cross the B to the A.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he lost the B early because he didn't
realize what he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost the A on an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he sort of ended up with,
he sort of ended up with not very much
[SPEAKER_00]: that he, you know, the C was like his most
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of what he had left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then strangely, it seems
like for whatever reason, all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: people that got haze, nothing much came of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter how much breeding or crossing
they did, nothing became famous like the
[SPEAKER_02]: later Neville Hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when I was going to, when I was
going to coffee shops, coffee shops were,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they were full of C5,
which is NL5 haze C, A5, which is NL5 haze
[SPEAKER_00]: A, A G13, which is G13 haze A.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had G13 haze C.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were full of Neville work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really carry much posse work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't carry any SAM work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't carry any of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even though they were easily
accessible, those were standard people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must have been a significant
quality difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think even today,
is there, is there a famous SAM cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a famous pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's all the stuff that they do
is not really, all the stuff that they do
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is all the stuff that's hoarded over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, you know, is what you might call it,
Neville cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and right now, I just want to
take the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If any of you older judge gentlemen were
watching this and have all these cuts,
[SPEAKER_02]: give me a, give me a ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to just to be able to chat about
them and get, and get further histories on
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of this stuff, you know,
one thing that should be mentioned about
[SPEAKER_00]: this is, uh, all this stuff happened on a
different continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what, uh, the story sounds
pretty straightforward and simple right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amount of talking and time and
energy and interviewing people and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that like, it's not just one
person's opinion and that we can get other
[SPEAKER_00]: people to back up opinions on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, me and you have been working
steady on this for, I want to say three
[SPEAKER_02]: years now, just me and you together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done our work on our own,
obviously, but like we have been pushing
[SPEAKER_02]: hard on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's taken a long time to even get up
to this point, to be able to say any of
[SPEAKER_02]: these things positively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when we say I'm positively,
uh, most of what we're saying is generally
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted, generally accepted fact for now,
like he said, if there's some old timers
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, with some secret information
out there, that's not well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this history is oral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these old guys have beefs with one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them don't like one another very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have their own egos and their own versions
of, of history and events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, uh, see, there's a,
there's a guy right there that just said
[SPEAKER_00]: his 70 year old neighbor has had NL two
since 93.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if that's the case, uh, we would love
to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there could be pockets of these
things that survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part now is that for a long time,
nobody gave a shit about these,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, about these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the information was a little bit
more verifiable because there wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody trying to claim rep or trying to
claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this joke, we call it pre pre,
um, where now ancient old, whatever has
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of the woodwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets a lot harder to weed through
who has what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I, I was talking with another
gentleman that we're, we're starting an
[SPEAKER_02]: interview with, um, and he was very
important in the Dutch seat scene and he
[SPEAKER_02]: was talking about some of his old lines
possibly popping up in the U S and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that happens every few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone says, I've got this stash of XYZ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kept, you know, Mason jars full of
every single one and done reproductions
[SPEAKER_02]: since 80 something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's hard unless you have
extensive knowledge about these old lines
[SPEAKER_02]: and run some, how are you ever going to
tell him?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a hard situation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a guy saying, you know,
there's some old school growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's pockets in America that aren't
on Instagram that aren't on, on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these never got on the forums that live in
police states that have kept their circles
[SPEAKER_00]: quite tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they don't, they might not even know
how rare or how cool some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been within their little circle
that they've just been growing and smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: on might be, you know, so we still have
hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time a bullshit artist comes up,
I'll freely admit that there's a small
[SPEAKER_00]: part of me that wishes it was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want it to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all the stories to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want every ancient rare being imaginable
to be accessible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuts and stuff like, yeah, the pop up and
be, um, you know, and be available to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sadly, there's a lot of people out
there that are just trying to make a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and when you sell beans, I mean,
think about how many people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: selling beans of, uh, roadkill skunk for
the last two or three years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I haven't seen any roadkill skunk
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to get finished flower with
roadkill skunk turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you can sell beans for quite
some time before nobody, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and exactly take a while before they
realize that you're not finding roadkill
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sell a lot of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people that have dropped
thousands of dollars of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopes and dreams, uh, and spent months
hunting and they get some floral citrus
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one citrus skunk one resell them
skunk one slight, you know, slight funk,
[SPEAKER_00]: slight whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not roadkill, not clear skunk turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, uh, it's sad in that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, people were asking some
other stuff and, you know, we got a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover, so we'll, we'll move on a bit,
but to say 89 90 is when Neville really
[SPEAKER_00]: established most of the strains that kind
of became famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when they all started popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they all started popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when he sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured out what he had, what was
consistent to breed with, what made sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: what lines people liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, he used to have this running
joke that people would ask for the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: level of quality imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he sold them an awesome Indica that
was a hybrid of two pure Indicas and it
[SPEAKER_00]: yielded like shit, they'd bitch and bitch
and moan and whine and complain because
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted the best possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also wanted to crush yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always been a difficulty in,
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, people want the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want the greatest turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's lots of people out there in
commercial world that don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that takes longer than nine or 10
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't be a pain to trim wanted to be
larpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want it to be finicky or low
meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massive yielding frosty, the highest
amount of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the strongest, most potent weed you
can possibly imagine with crazy turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want donkey dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want buds and I want it done in 50 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, rarely does that occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of the, a lot of the
famous strains that we all smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, from a production standpoint are
annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially the last decade or so it's
gotten worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody would ever pick to grow cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nobody would ever pick to grow cush
where it's like, dink, dink, dink,
[SPEAKER_00]: dink, dink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nugs here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't hold themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you were like a commercial
farmer in the real world, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd be looking for some kind of like
green crack, blue dream type structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: solid top to bottom buds, easy to grow,
fairly fast finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what, from a production
standpoint, uh, and a happiness
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, um, even sour diesel,
you know, that yields pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time, kind of feathery,
makes a lot of D buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mess it up, it can be really larpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, super tasty and it works
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burns really nice, but it's not blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, very white or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that, that's just
covered in nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, so yeah, so, uh, the,
uh, uh, maybe we should talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he created all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was the largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was really only two, you know,
there's other people that will claim to
[SPEAKER_00]: have seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scentsy seeds had a tiny seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positronix had a small seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was other seed banks in Holland,
but there was really only two seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really why we're spending so
much time talking about it is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was really only two seed banks that
were selling a lot of seed in America and
[SPEAKER_02]: in Amsterdam in selling to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the first two seed banks
that really offered worldwide sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: To anybody that was willing to come to
Holland and buy them or fill out their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their mail order sheet and send them an
envelope with some money and a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was super Sativa seed club,
uh, and the seed bank, which was Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Div Tiva seed club, uh, started a little
bit after Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it had similar things to him and had
some of their own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but Neville was the, he was the
elephant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the big dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, he was the, he was the one selling
the vast majority of stuff that people in
[SPEAKER_00]: America were buying from Holland was
Neville's.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really, that's really what makes
him so important because the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed game is super diversified now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically almost had a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's why all these strains that are
around today usually have something of
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that there's a lot of, there's a
lot of Neville work in a lot of modern
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because he was the only game and he
was one of the only games in town and tons
[SPEAKER_00]: and tons of people got his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they bred his stuff into stuff
they already had in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his stuff got blended in and you
know, his stuff got super famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the NL five Hayes became a
phenomenon in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started being great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they call it the heist Hayes,
you know, the PIF, the church,
[SPEAKER_00]: the this, the that, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a massive, a massive, um,
and the super skunk, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: became super famous, uh, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's talked about how super skunk and NL
five Hayes were his two top selling
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so enormous amounts of those
seeds got sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of what, uh, maybe we can
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 90 catalog is the final catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of Neville's ownership of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I have that one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that there's a couple,
there's the most famous thing that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the 90 catalog was he released,
um, super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, super skunk was, you know,
when sadly, uh, Sam did not like skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got to say, Sam liked skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did not like skunk smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't like skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took skunk one and he tried to breed
the skunk out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is by his own quote, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has his own quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going for more of the citrus,
grapes, sweet, floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: He liked those aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going for bud structure and other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't like the rank skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tried to, uh, this, I'll answer another
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver Pearl came out as a,
as a single strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the last two years of the seed
bank, uh, 88, 89 and 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered silver Pearl and I,
I quote me on the silver Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it's, uh, early Pearl something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I think it's early Pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be NL five early Pearl skunk one,
something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only see early Pearl improved in this
one and it doesn't list anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, it's something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also released a silver Pearl by
Hayes in those couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was called silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at the time, uh, he called it,
he called it silver Pearl by Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it got shortened to silver,
silver Hayes at Sensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, um, you know, there was a guy named
Jim Ortega that we'll talk about real
[SPEAKER_00]: briefly and, um, Jim Ortega, he traded
with Jim Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim gave him Kush for garlic bud,
um, uh, maple leaf indica and Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered Hawaiian indica, um,
by NL one in the last couple of years of
[SPEAKER_00]: his catalog, maybe three years of his
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered a maple leaf, um, pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that may be, uh, uh, Afghan breeder
packs, I think where you could literally
[SPEAKER_00]: buy some of the original seed stock that
Jim Ortega gave him, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how amazing would that have been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and he, um, and he offered garlic
bud as a pure strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the only thing that never really got
offered is a pure that never really got
[SPEAKER_00]: messed with too much was Kush for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there is a thing he sold called Kush
by Kush, which he said Kush by Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he said he crossed his two best
Kush's to, um, you know, uh, to each other
[SPEAKER_00]: and his two best Kush's were Kush for and
NL two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what year that one's in?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to show it, but I can't find
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that one's in,
that one might be in 87.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's at least one of them in the 89
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how clear it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also offered skunk Kush,
which was, and so that's, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then, uh, um, so maybe we're
getting pretty in depth here, but maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we should talk about, um,
his fame led to issues, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's selling millions of dollars in seed
to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Reagan era and then the George
Bush era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the height of the war on drugs,
large penalties, weeds, totally illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there was a situation in which a,
um, a hydro store got raided, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: from whatever reason, some kind,
some kind of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they discovered that this guy was
supplying a bunch of growers and in that
[SPEAKER_00]: they found money and Neville's catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they realized that, uh, they realized
that he was selling the dollars in seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you notice in some of these back
catalogs, it always says that it shipped
[SPEAKER_02]: from the U S or like in the high times,
uh, ads for Neville's things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would always say ship from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's interesting about that is
this isn't factual, but I believe it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that Neville, I think had partners
that he smuggled seeds into America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would send Neville money and
then he would communicate what you needed
[SPEAKER_00]: and they watched the seeds from within the
U S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was pretty, um, he was
transparent about that when it was going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, that meant
that every seed batch didn't have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just had to get it through customs
occasionally and then he could sell it
[SPEAKER_00]: within the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you can imagine, uh, the DEA and
the government at the time took a pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, poor view of that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, operation green merchant
happens where they decide to raid um,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone, every growth store in the United
for the most part, they rated the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: stores in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a big push, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, Neville gets caught, I believe in
Australia and he gets busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he ends up spending it a good
amount of time in jail, better part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that, you know, we're not
gonna, this, this, this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, we're not going to talk very much
about SSSE cause we're going to save that
[SPEAKER_00]: for a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what that did is that sort of,
uh, um, like to a domino effect of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a domino effect of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, super sativa seed club decided to
stop, um, because they saw what was going
[SPEAKER_00]: on with Neville and it was pretty serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville was already in, was obviously in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, this gave an opportunity for
others who had seen how, how Neville and
[SPEAKER_00]: the super sativa seed club were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It left a void in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in Holland, it was still, it was legal
at that time, obviously to produce seed
[SPEAKER_00]: for, um, to produce seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only places in the world where
it was totally legal to produce cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Neville was, he was sitting in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he was fighting extradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to extradite Neville to
America because, um, they wanted to put
[SPEAKER_00]: him in jail for life in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Australia and Holland, which he was a
citizen of both, didn't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was stuck in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he, um, you know, there was all of
a sudden there was no seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no seed banks left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused a bunch of, it caused a bunch of
ripple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a whole bunch of growers in America
got busted, um, to do their relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: with various, uh, hydro stores and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, Greg, Seattle,
Greg talked in his interview with Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: about how by the late eighties and that
era, they had basically lost everything
[SPEAKER_00]: because of a series of rolling busts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there were heavy presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really going after people,
electricity, all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, Sensei, which was founded by
Ben and Alan drunkers, they saw an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and they offered to bail
Neville out of jail and, uh, give him
[SPEAKER_00]: money to help him fight his situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as he sold them their company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the invention of Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the death of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sensei, uh, Sensei absorbed him and
all of a sudden went from a nobody to the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest game in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they bought, uh, they,
they bought his seat back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start offering, um, you know,
and we actually, the Sensei 91 seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog is one of the rarest catalogs,
um, because it, only was out for,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was obviously only out for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows the merger of the seed bank
with Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a much, much more limited
catalog than what they offered in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a much more limited one than Neville
was currently offering, but by the time he
[SPEAKER_02]: split.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, uh,
sadly for Neville, Neville went from being
[SPEAKER_00]: the owner of the largest, most successful
seed bank in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the head breeder of Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost his company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost his self-control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the government hated him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he was trapped in Holland for a
long time because the, the America wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to come steal him, drive him to America
and have him face charges of life in
[SPEAKER_00]: prison for seed sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland refused to extradite him because
since seed sales were legal and he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: citizen of Holland, they were not going to
extradite one of their citizens for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was legal in their own
country and for them to go to life in
[SPEAKER_00]: prison in some other country.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some other country, he is not a
citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some other country, he's not a citizen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had his freedom, but he was stuck in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DEA in Interpol was after his ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest, most, most, uh, famous seed
company and had to give it to Ben and Alan
[SPEAKER_00]: drunkers and work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, didn't he lose the castle as well
at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost the castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a number of projects he had
that when he was in jail, never saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: light of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was putting on releasing a,
uh, NL five seed line in 90, in 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he had taken the NL five cutting that
showed earlier and he had BX'd it like
[SPEAKER_00]: eight times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he used NL one, like I said,
with everything, uh, he BX'd it eight
[SPEAKER_00]: times and he was planning on releasing it
in, um, 1991 and it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That project disappeared and never got
released again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was some things, uh,
somebody asked if they could see it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The NL five?
[SPEAKER_00]: The NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so, so obviously that sucked for
Neville, uh, spending a good 10 months in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail is no fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jail foods, no fun being in, in,
in, you know, concrete jungle holds no
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Losing your company's no fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your company's no, I mean, yeah,
it's like, basically they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we'll do you a solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you out of jail and we'll get
you back to Holland, but we want your
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: By a minor competitor at that someone that
wasn't even close to the level.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, since he wasn't even close to where
Super City BC club or they were nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're sitting in jail and your
options are keep sitting in jail or have
[SPEAKER_00]: these sort of, uh, uh, greasy Dutch
businessmen, uh, offer to get you out and
[SPEAKER_00]: get you home and give you some money and
buy your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds real good at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he chose the get out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, card, but then he lost
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, that was sort of the
start of, you know, by the time that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Matt, Matt can speak to this a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got to communicate quite a bit with
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've chatted with him a number of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt had a much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back and forth with him, uh, much later in
his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded super dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I just mean that, you know,
they communicated a lot more over a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more months, a lot more directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, I met him through other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go to Holland quite a bit to get
seeds and I ended up meeting them a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a young guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I had some kind of,
uh, you know, massive, uh, information
[SPEAKER_00]: dump from Neville to myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't interviewing him or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little shell shocked, uh,
meeting somebody like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but you know, Matt can attest
that, uh, that was sort of the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's bitterness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, uh, things Neville paid more
of a price than most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, uh, spreading seeds for overgrowing
the government for that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if you look at it, he felt like he
was owed the most for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he felt like most people
lived off the back of his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it's not necessarily incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he never, yeah, he never got,
um, he never, he never got to reap the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits as much, um, of his work as other
people did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, his life got burned down on any number
of different occasions to be said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is kind of a personal part,
not, um, not, uh, it's not the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to talk about with Neville,
but he was a heroin addict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's actually the reason why he went
from Australia to Holland was,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, you know, he was getting,
he was, uh, heavily addicted in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties or he was getting treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I'm sure, um, that some of his
life issues were certainly self-inflicted
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you struggle with addiction
like that, your life is, um, your life is
[SPEAKER_00]: tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, you have, you have ups and
downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you have issues, you know,
you, he probably wasn't the easiest person
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably had moods, major mood swings,
major mood swings, you know, better days
[SPEAKER_00]: than others, better months than others
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and then on top of that,
like, you know, a lot of times really
[SPEAKER_00]: talented people, um, sometimes they're
paying the ass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so people, talented people can
be very hard to communicate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what I will say about Neville that
was different than most people is that
[SPEAKER_00]: most Dutch, which is some, which is
different than a little bit in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there's lots of people in
America that are just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, in, he was probably one of the
only Dutch that really loved the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: really did things.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the famous Dutch, I'm not making
a big general statement about everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as far as like the, you know,
the Dutch are pretty famous for being
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely business oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll, they'll tell you the truth as
much as it helps their bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't help their bottom line,
they could give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville was extremely open about lines
and strains and what he used and how he
[SPEAKER_00]: did it, what he did it with and where he
got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody in the Dutch scene that we
know more about who he got strains from
[SPEAKER_02]: and what he did to create strains,
all everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other seed banks in Holland,
it's a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have zero interest in telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had decades to tell you they don't
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few that might be popping up
that, that, uh, are pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I wanted to make a qualifier
because he's by no means is the only one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are plenty of, you know,
and that's the sad thing is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, Ben, uh, the drunkers are
still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're terrible interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about history.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not their interest at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will tell you to this day that they
have every original plant known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed with all the same plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even been verified by any number of
different sources that they outsourced it
[SPEAKER_00]: to Spain sometime ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they lost a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you can't get actual history out
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville, Neville cared while he had the
seed bank, he gave a bunch of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was honest about when he lost certain
strains, hopped up on Mr. Nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time later in like 09, 10,
11 era.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked a lot of questions pretty
directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the drunkers and Sensei are a black
hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't tell you shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Major black hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know that they even know shit
to tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think there's some obviously they do
and they were part of, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: that they would have any kind of knowledge
about any of the breeding going on at
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, this is, um,
so, so that's kind of, I guess we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: segue into Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're headed into Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're headed into Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville, you know, Neville had the seed
bank, most famous seed bank created a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most famous strains, gets busted,
spends a bunch of time in jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: gets bailed out, loses his company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's head breeder at Sensei.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it took some time to
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Matt and I have spent a bunch of time
analyzing this and, um, I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to put it, but Sensei,
there was certain famous things like NL
[SPEAKER_00]: five haze and, uh, super skunk that they
loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Left alone because the aim already had
such great, uh, that's that, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it had already been marketed under that
name and was already so successful that
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't have a need to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some pretty good comments
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to them in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could eat shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so anyway, well, this is,
this is super long winded, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why it's so important is
that the, a lot, a lot, a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: famous strains and are named elite cuts
from the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the things that went into the
famous cuts that we all work with today
[SPEAKER_00]: came directly from Neville's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he was the biggest game in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, probably from 1985 to the late
nineties, um, he was the biggest force in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, the tons of
people in America were getting his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and, okay, so there's,
there's stuff coming in that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that's actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start chatting about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, so since he buys the seed bank and
they, in my opinion, they wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: obscure exactly how much of the seed bank
they had taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, super skunk and L five
haze, some of the stuff that was super
[SPEAKER_00]: famous all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already they left alone, but they were the
first company to start trademarking names
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, which still goes on today and
sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's still battles going on about,
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, the, I see some stuff people
are talking about early Shiva Shanti had
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic, but in it, anyone remember the
early Shiva Shanti that threw garlic,
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanos, uh, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one of the catalogs that actually
talks about that specifically that very
[SPEAKER_02]: first catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just reading it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty funny in the sense that
my opinion is, is that Shiva Shanti is
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is one of them at one point
was garlic bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll try not to get too deep into
it because it's kind of a, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of a nerdy subject, but if you
look at the seed bank catalogs and you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the sensey catalogs, um,
since he ended up using a lot of Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: stock, stock photos, a lot of his verbiage
and his descriptions, just much shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: versions of them in his catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, they, she garlic bud
disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it becomes Shiva Shanti Shiva Shanti
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like a hybrid of become
Shiva Shanti too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they use the same, they use a lot
of the same verbiage and describing Shiva
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti as Neville's descriptions of garlic
bud and the same picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use the exact same photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, another one that we could talk about
is NL five skunk one becomes a Shiva
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually the only one that they
changed the name that in the sensey
[SPEAKER_00]: description, they actually say it's
actually NL five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they still leave that in the
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took it from NL five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it Shiva.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called it Shiva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that people will
probably find extremely interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or maybe, maybe not, but Neville's NL
two F three, he always referred to going
[SPEAKER_00]: back early as the NL two, any description
you can find in the seed bank catalog of
[SPEAKER_00]: any hybrids he made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does he call it NL two,
but he always calls it a Hindu Kush type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Northern lights gets ported over
from the seed bank, Northern lights one F
[SPEAKER_00]: three becomes the Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you can actually tell because
they, in the sensey catalog, they list
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern lights as a three time Indica
winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: 88, 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look it up and NL one was the
Indica winner in 88, 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL two becomes Hindu Kush.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since he changed the name, uh,
and, and NL two used the same picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: they use similar descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back, um, even, even straight
up in certain stuff, like they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sold a skunk Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called it skunk one by their best
Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville sells a skunk Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the seed bank and he calls it NL two by
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same description,
except for they just call it Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NL two doesn't disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets a different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absorbed differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two is that there was another seed company
that stole NL two and they sold NL two was
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch passion and they NL two under the
name Oasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, Adam dumb, I think his name
is he sold one is closet queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also an NL two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pure NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NL two is sort of drops off as a name,
but it lives on in other names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of art of, uh,
that's sort of the start of, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rename game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the real early rename game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just read off some renames for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit the renames.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got, I got to look away at the
camera so I can actually like,
[SPEAKER_00]: see this little chart I got going on,
but Neville called it silver Pearl by
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, since he calls it silver Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, garlic bud becomes Shiva Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I just said, NL one becomes
Northern lights and L two becomes Hindu
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, big skunk, which was big bud by
skunk one at the sea simply becomes sensey
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash plant by NL one by Swazi becomes
African queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my other nickname that a lot of
people call me African queen, big bud by
[SPEAKER_00]: NL one simply becomes big bud Hawaiian
Indica by NL one simply becomes Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was really only a few of the most
famous like skunk one, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: NL five Hayes, super skunk that,
uh, that kept the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed everything else, but they
left us clues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were fucking lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of laziness, pure laziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use the same pictures and they use a
lot of the same verbiage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they even kept the same yields and
harvest harvest times and other data that
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville included.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they made it, so they made it,
uh, and then they trademarked those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then all of a sudden they own the
trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see where, where's a good segue
from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I can't even bring up my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Shiva, like I said, Shiva Shanti,
it is garlic bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses the same verbiage in the
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses the exact same photo from Neville
catalogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is garlic, but I had that pulled out
earlier just to show to the two side by
[SPEAKER_02]: side, but I can't remember where I put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah, we don't, I mean, it's,
it's, it's, we could, we could,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we could go, we could go in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep it relatively brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, is that since he was
trying to obscure just how much they went
[SPEAKER_00]: from a little company that had barely
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the biggest company, um, the biggest
company in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the timeline we're talking right
now, this is 1991.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is, this is early to mid
nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice is, I'm just answering a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice is way, way later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably won't even get to that part of
cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that didn't start early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville's working as the head breeder
for, um, for Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to talk about these
companies very much, but it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: good to mention that Neville not only
spawned Sensei seeds, but everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: working for Neville got their own ideas
and he spawned a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if, uh, um, well,
yeah, somebody just posted Shiva Shanti is
[SPEAKER_00]: not garlic now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to why things aren't the way
they are anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Adam Dunn from TH seeds, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Adam, Adam from TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Simon, who is famous for serious
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony, who ended up making sag Martha,
they all worked at Sensei under Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, after leaving, uh, Tony and
Simon started cerebral seeds in 1994 for
[SPEAKER_00]: one year and then split Tony made sag
Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Simon made, um, serious and,
um, you know, and, uh, uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Adam, like I said, made THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so Neville working with
Neville, you know, uh, Neville sort of put
[SPEAKER_00]: all four of those companies on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those companies would have existed if they
hadn't been able to work either for
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville under Neville, uh, Sensei bought
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, and I think that for
most of Neville's time at Sensei,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was breeding and doing a bunch of
projects, but, uh, you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalogs that come out from those
nineties, the most early to mid nineties
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the seed bank catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you know, there was a few
things that Neville got rid of at the
[SPEAKER_00]: later era of the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he didn't really like Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he sold it for the first few years of
the seed bank and then he, and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated it since he brought it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was a couple other strains that,
uh, that popped up here and there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, um, Sensei was the
seed bank continued and, uh, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they absorbed all of his history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they started claiming there from
85, they started the originator of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these various strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of like, you know, since they
bought it, they bought all the history
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Neville, Neville was working for
some, uh, some Dutch businessmen that he
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it ends up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so he worked for Sensei and we
can, since, since nothing much changed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the seed bank to Sensei, um,
we don't really have to talk a bunch about
[SPEAKER_00]: that except for, uh, you know,
I started going to Amsterdam in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very famous people on IG and
stuff that started going in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties and mid nineties and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sensei was one of the primary places
where we got things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, um, Sensei was really
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was their head breeder still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, and so,
you know, Neville from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 85 to 90 at the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from 91 to 95 at Sensei,
um, you know, um, a massive amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk and NL five Hayes,
all the NL five Hayes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Cuban black, the PIF, the Heights
Hayes, the various, the Miami,
[SPEAKER_00]: that all came from that era of,
uh, you know, NL five Hayes seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he, uh, you know, they lost the G
13 cutting by Neville's own admission in
[SPEAKER_00]: about 93.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the ones that got sick and
died early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lost the NL five Hayes cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're 94, 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons why all the best
phenos of NL five Hayes and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in, uh, uh, America were found sort of
between 89 and 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then once the, once the mom was
lost, uh, people didn't really find the
[SPEAKER_00]: same quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I think all the name
deletes of NL five Hayes of which there's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably eight or 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come from that six year period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's any that come later
than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen any good NL five Hayes
cuttings in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't come from that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, uh, so well,
maybe we'll tie a bow on the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a fancy thing because
we've, we've kind of covered most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, the last famous thing that never
Neville did there was he was working on
[SPEAKER_00]: this hybrid, um, which was NL five Hayes,
uh, or people call it C five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had this very famous mother cut that
was sold in all the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the two of his two favorite
C five cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he was trying to play around and
make a poly hybrid and he was playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it to skunk Hayes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wasn't really happy with where it
was yet, but Ben and Alan drunkers being,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, businessmen, they had spent a
bunch of money and they were sponsoring
[SPEAKER_00]: the 95 cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis cup was all about Jack
Herrera and it was all about his life and
[SPEAKER_00]: his history and his contributions to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ben went to Neville and said,
Hey, we want to release a Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have something that we drop at the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that be a great marketing tool?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the number one sponsor of this cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spending a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Betty, um, as far as Neville was
concerned, but he released NL five Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: by skunk Hayes and they called it Jack
Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt we need to spend very much time
talking about Jack Herrera, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's super Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it led to Cindy 99, you know,
it led to a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was big yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a trimmer's dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was, it smelled like, uh,
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, uh, people have a, a love and
hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of people have dislike for that
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack aroma became infamous for,
uh, you know, being something that
[SPEAKER_00]: repelled people and stuff like Jack Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People not genuinely know what genuinely
speaking know what, uh, or generally
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking know what Jack Terps are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first time that people ever
heard about the word turpentine long
[SPEAKER_00]: before that Terp was identified,
people called it Jack Terps.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack was a super high yielding,
uh, you know, strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people grew it and that was
people's first experience with extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it, it bred dominant Matt can talk
about trying to get interesting phenos out
[SPEAKER_00]: of turpentine dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It strains that don't give you turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very tough to, to breed with
turpentine anything and try to infuse that
[SPEAKER_00]: into a lot of Jack Terps, train wreck
turps.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders have, have thrown their
hat in the ring and tried to breed with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot because it's such a vigorous,
powerful, high yielding fun plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's real hard to find a not
turpentine dominant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, um, in, in my modern times
though, people are finding out that
[SPEAKER_02]: turpentine is actually really good in
extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes them very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a little bit of a
renaissance for the turpentine queens out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, um, maybe since you can't see
anything, maybe we'll pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to answer some questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and figure out what questions we
need to answer and let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number one voted thing,
and we've talked about it a little was why
[SPEAKER_00]: was Sam's never able to produce a haze to
rival nevels?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the outstanding difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the number one biggest question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, I think you, you,
you've, uh, answered this before when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was talking with you about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I actually think I mentioned it mostly
a little earlier in the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, we don't know why Sam,
you know, Sam sold haze to positronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought haze from the flying
Dutchman, that was Sam's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold clothes of wholesale seed to any
number of brokers in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sold it through their seed
banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, uh, everybody in
Holland wanted Neville's haze hybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody found anything that rivaled what
Neville was able to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and a lot of times,
uh, Caleb, uh, CSI myself, Matt,
[SPEAKER_00]: others, we always talk about like the
proof is in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't, uh, and whatever reason,
maybe it was sheer luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe it was Neville's story is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did get earlier haze than,
than Sam produced later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Sam has, has been open, which is
something that I found, um, which is I
[SPEAKER_00]: found, uh, uh, hard to believe,
to be honest as a breeder is he loves haze
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, he never ever made any
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just, he just said, all I did was
open pollinated to keep it as wide as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't do any selection work,
any line work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, as a, as a breeder, never ever playing
around with your favorite phenos from your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite line seems really unusual to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like me never fucking with
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but, but that's what Sam says.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, and it's also possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can talk about this for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when you open pollinate,
that's great because you open it up wider,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that means it might be a hell of a lot
more effort to dig stuff that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Sam, by repeatedly open pollinating
it and never making any selections,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, he might've open pollinated his way
into jungle weed or hemp or he might've
[SPEAKER_00]: lost a bunch of the quality that led
people to love haze in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you look at, um, like Tom Hill says,
um, he would even say, you need at least
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 packs, you know, a hundred seeds to
find a single keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the, the repeatedly OPing probably
didn't help anything because obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many phenotypes, even in
positronics haze that's been worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many phenotypes that you need
to pop a hundred to find a single one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Sam has claimed that everyone got
the exact same haze and no one got any
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that a bit hard to believe because
there's lots of people that bought flying
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutchman haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of people that bought posse
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of people that bought,
uh, Tom Hill haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, haze has been sold for decades in a
wide variety of places and all the elites
[SPEAKER_00]: that people hoard come from Neville stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think that we have a lot of
quality Afghans out there and you'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to cross some pure haze to some other
good Afghans and get all the results to
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the G13 haze and the NL5 haze and
so on and so forth, no one's been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Neville did also have the theory that
he talked about much later on that he only
[SPEAKER_02]: believed in breeding with haze males,
that that was the key to finding the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the whole URL haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was through haze males breeding and not
using them as females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of that might be that he
lost the two best venos of females in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be some of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he ended up doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also say too, that collecting
pollen from some 18 or 20 week haze male,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then dusting it on other plants when
appropriate is probably a lot easier of a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder aspect than trying to wait for a
18 or 20 week female to be the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: time to pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something to be said for the
fact that you could collect a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and then dump it on stuff later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much harder to breed with the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, there's another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Gene recently mentioned that you
and he have been doing some research and
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked like new Kush could most likely
be a renamed NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we chatted about that already at
length.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely believe that the Hindu Kush
that was sold at Sensei is just NL too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, have I had any dealings with Gypsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and it was just a really bad
proposal for me to front a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that he would sit on the money
for, I want to say six months to a year,
[SPEAKER_02]: at which point he would pay you out mostly
in credit store credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would wait like almost a year to be
able to use anything from anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was no way in fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll have podcasts that deal with
Gypsy's era of seed banks at some other
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not necessarily a ton of him
specifically, but he's from a different
[SPEAKER_00]: era than we're discussing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, outside of the work that Neville
brought to the world, who outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: original big names contributed most new
strains worth something to the culture
[SPEAKER_00]: early on?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned some of them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll just associate some names with
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Sam Skunkman brought, uh, Hayes and
Skunk 1 to Europe, uh, or popularized it
[SPEAKER_00]: to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jim Ortega, who's a very mysterious
character, brought Hawaiian indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic bud, uh, maple leaf indica and Kush
4 to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all used extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were used extensively in projects and
so became very famous building blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mel Frank, uh, who's still quite well
known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: He contributed the Afghani 1 and the
Durban poison to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know if Jorge Cervantes,
uh, I don't think he directly contributed
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but he did make the links.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he certainly connected Neville,
um, uh, growers in Oregon and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: that led to the hash plant and G 13,
which obviously entered into the pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: legendary status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Rob Clark, who wrote marijuana botany,
uh, hashish and some other really
[SPEAKER_00]: important cannabis books.
[SPEAKER_00]: He contributed a bunch of, um,
you know, California orange, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: various Mexicans, various sativa crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he certainly brought early girl,
early Pearl type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all credited to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm trying to think of, you know,
that's sort of those, those names right
[SPEAKER_00]: there are sort of the backbone and the NL
guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Seattle Greg, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL and the NL group from the Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contributed obviously all the NL
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, there's a number of people we
don't know who they are, but those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are sort of the foundational, um,
people that brought a lot of stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up not only getting brought over
there, but ended up getting used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into a lot and work on balance for NL two
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that was his.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a guy named Herbie that
contributed the NL five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I'm sure behind all these
famous names are just like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was probably a group of people,
uh, were good friends and stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed various things that their
names have been lost to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, if I, if not so dog and Matt
could turn back time, what would you buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, you know, uh, I would buy
everything from the seed bank,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, literally everything you
could, I would buy hundreds of seeds of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that I could, all the Durbin,
all the skunk one, all the NL five haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: the app, the maple leaf mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of these things we talk about,
um, but you know, Neville was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: few people that got to run through a
hundred hundreds or thousands of even of
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds and really see what was in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the famous phenos,
but, um, you know, uh, we were really
[SPEAKER_00]: young when these things were out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like six, seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little older than you, but even
still, like I said, I was, I was only 18
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1994 when I started going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was even sort of catching the tail
end of certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question was Afghan T what's
known about it, the strains it was used in
[SPEAKER_00]: geographically, what part of Afghanistan
did it come from via who, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to preface this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to preface this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these people, all these people talking
about roadkill skunk and all the other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sincerely believe in, in just from the
work with, um, even the heirloom Afghani,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, uh, labor sours, the fucking super
skunk and diesel, all that, I sincerely
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that's the direction of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are all these people chasing in
different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fair to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's on an even playing field.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the direction I'd look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, uh, the maple leaf,
we don't, we don't know anything about Jim
[SPEAKER_00]: Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where any of the strains
that he got came from zero documented
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about he's still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that he could,
um, come out and tell some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it is a mystery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know we'd love to have them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know, we know the story of his work
basically as soon as he started trading
[SPEAKER_00]: the nevel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when he pops up and you know,
the, um, we can talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: the maple leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the maple leaf nevels talked about
extensively, uh, when he first started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it out, he started getting some
sweet big bud types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, he started growing more of
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he found some more like hash
plant types, some dark hashy thick types.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called those types Ortega.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then he started growing more out
and then he eventually found what he
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to skunk archetypes,
which he called Afghan T and Afghan S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important again, because when
most people hear skunk, they think skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: one, he wasn't referring to skunk one
types in this Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he was just kind of a little bit of
the structure, a little bit of the nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of the look.
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he said about it is that,
so obviously the, the maple leaf was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a, a hodgepodge of different phenos
that popped out of Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you found is if you took a big
bud type and you bred with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the maple leaf, big bud type bred big bud
like, you took an Ortega type,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hash plant type, and you bred with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of ended up being hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of bred true to type when
they popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bred with the Afghan T or Afghan S,
it also breeded true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the T is pretty famous, uh,
in the sense that it is the mom of super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he claims it's what put the funk in
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what crossing it back to its Afghan,
you know, to an Afghan, the Afghan T
[SPEAKER_00]: brought out the, the, the rank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a, it took a kind of a sweet
floral skunk and made it reek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, Afghan T is incredibly famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's probably the least well-known
thing we're going to talk about tonight as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as being incredibly famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the least well-known, but it's the
mother of one of the most famous strains
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And possibly the reason why that strain
was so hunted nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super skunk is probably one of the most
well-known cannabis strains in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and he says that that's what made it
super.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading the Afghan T, um, Afghan T also
crossed well with Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a thing called Afghan Hayes,
um, Mr. Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, that's supposed to be a,
uh, uh, an a maple leaf by Hayes C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to verify obviously,
if that's the case, but, uh, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation from Neville that made super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, and it crossed great with Hayes C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's kind of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's some other stuff that,
uh, I just answered the Jim Ortega
[SPEAKER_00]: question on a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some Mendo perp stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's pretty wide ranging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we discussed garlic bud pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed Hindu Kush, the Friesland and
Sensi Star and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to on a different episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll certainly talk about those,
uh, a little bit more, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, where they like to have been coming
from the Seattle Gregg's group,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a Sensi NL5 line in 89?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was a, uh, Sensi didn't have NL5
because in 89, the seed bank was still
[SPEAKER_00]: owned by Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and there was never a pure NL5 line
offered as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there also was never a 1988 Sensi
seeds, G13 hash plant.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you can use the Melvannix garlic
Fino of NL5?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Matt take that one if he wants
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do we know if Neville's kids have
knowledge on his father's work?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: His son has some knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know his son and Neville's sister
are currently doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any info on what Kush4 is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I said, Jim Ortega is still
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could maybe one day expound upon that
if he likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of rumor about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rumor that the clone might exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rumor that the clone is,
uh, is not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, uh, it's a pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pure Kush variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL2 type variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to say on that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got this guy said I got to try a
maple leaf from an old timer in Georgia,
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost like Dr. Pepper meets roadkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that sounds, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when did the silver Pearl that
Pipworks come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think we talked earlier,
the silver Pearl started being offered by
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville at the seed bank around 88,
89.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was offered 88, 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the strains that got offered
at Sensei later on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is Steve Hagar just as guilty as Sam
the skunk man as AKA Dave Watson from
[SPEAKER_00]: Operation Green Merchant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's Steve Hagar?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the, uh, guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one of the, uh, the big head
honchos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, high crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole subject could be a whole
podcast in itself, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the rumors and accusations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people that believe
one way and there's a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: believe another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a pretty in depth one.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as Sam goes, a lot of people do say
that there is something to do with federal
[SPEAKER_02]: informants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've looked up extensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen a damn thing come to light
for any proof of any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say Neville told me
specifically that he said, yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody knew Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody knew his DEA handler that
walked around with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Neville also, during that time,
Neville was telling me that him and Sam
[SPEAKER_02]: were fucking making video means back and
forth at each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how reliable that
information is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Sam and Neville had famous beef coming
from Neville's bust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those Kung Fu dub over video means that
they would send back and forth at each
[SPEAKER_02]: other in 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, I wish someone still had them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, you know, there was,
um, there was, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there's a friend of ours that
mentioned Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can touch on that real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so Black Domina was something that,
you know, in, in Neville's, Neville's seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank era, the vast majority of the stuff
that we were talking about in the eighties
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is kind of, this is kind of the
same with the super seed to have a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: club is they were basically all F ones or
very simple hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's kind of what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were crossing pure strains
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were releasing lines of pure strains
they had gotten, and they were taking
[SPEAKER_00]: these pure strains like skunk and Northern
lights or haze and skunk or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Northern lights and haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were crossing them in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the poly hybrid terms started to
pop where you started getting more complex
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Black Domina was a cross of four
Indicas, uh, that Neville, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: released that Neville bred while he was at
Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mother was consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother was a, one of his favorite
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a NL one by hash plant or by NL one
to say it correctly, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, the NL one was the dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the mom and released three
versions of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, depending on the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the dads was, um, I believe
Afghani one by NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another dad that was,
uh, Afghani one by Ortega, which is maple
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was the third and final dad,
which I believe was the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds, but it's kind of hard to say
people wanted, uh, with all these pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicas being crossed together,
people wanted a larger yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he crossed that hash plant by NL
one to a, uh, garlic bud by NL two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so Black Domina, uh, had three
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, mom was always the same, uh,
dad varied as they played around with what
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a really good name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just fucking went with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, um, of all my trips to Europe,
uh, I lost it sadly, but a Black Dominic,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Fino I found was one of the best
things I ever got, uh, out of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had a great, great, great variety of
it and tasted peppery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely frosty yielded pretty
nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was dark, uh, dark Afghan,
not too leafy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I still had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my like super regrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have some good friends,
um, that there was a rare 12 week Fino,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that was likely a recessive garlic bud
type, uh, that people really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the lady Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was a lot of good Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Domina popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was probably one of the best later
things that Neville did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, so I don't know, we can,
um, so we've probably been talking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long it's been going,
but we'll, we'll hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll tie it off with, um, we'll tie off
Neville, at least with sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the last phase of what he did and why
that's important to maybe, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: call it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we didn't get to everybody's
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be hard to get to everybody's
questions, but some of your questions
[SPEAKER_00]: might lead to more, uh, you know,
more podcasts in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might dive into some of these things
and different ones real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to do a giveaway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so whoever, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, last time y'all motherfuckers,
I said, whoever had the best question,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gets the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do that again, but please
don't have four people message me saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that they were that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, it does get confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll do a giveaway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what should I give away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that's referencing something
from tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do the, uh, the G 13 and all two
blue bonnets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give away a pack of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whoever had that top question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, message me, I will mention real quick
the, the, there's a tie for the two
[SPEAKER_00]: highest questions tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both of them win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one person said, can you describe the
different growth structures, flower times
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, flavor effects, pros and cons of
the different chem cuts, chem D,
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91, chem sys, chem four.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do a chem dog episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Won't touch that one tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have a long history with chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got blessed and I got to be one of
the earlier people that got ahold of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the chem D since oh six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've had the chem four for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of experience with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do a long talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, you'll hear more about the
chem, the most political episode we will
[SPEAKER_00]: ever do probably that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's other ones I
think that could cause some fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, but we will, I promise you,
we will, we will talk extensively about
[SPEAKER_00]: chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll, we'll be popping out these
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you'll hear about it in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so to tie off the Neville bit after
answering questions is Neville was ticked
[SPEAKER_00]: off about, uh, working under Ben and Alan
drunkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't into it, uh, anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he left in 95, 96, um, and he
partnered with a younger cat named Shanti,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't talk about him extensively,
um, but he came to Europe in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties and he popularized white widow,
uh, great white shark, white rhino,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he was also from Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a bit younger than Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sort of, um, and so when Neville left
Fancy, uh, Shanti Neville and this
[SPEAKER_00]: gentleman named Arjun partnered at the
greenhouse, uh, coffee shop, which should
[SPEAKER_00]: be pretty familiar to everybody that has
even a rudimentary knowledge of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, usually the first seeds everyone buys
post 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, they had a very successful
seed bank and they had a very successful
[SPEAKER_00]: series of coffee shops in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I went to them a bunch and so,
um, basically at that point in Neville's
[SPEAKER_00]: career, he wasn't as interested in
breeding with a bunch of Afghans and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, but he was really interested in
his continuing his haze work because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's what interested him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said earlier about the Jack
Herrera, um, Neville didn't consider that
[SPEAKER_00]: line finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just released it under pressure from
Ben and Alan drunkers to coincide with the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, with the, uh, the cannabis cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after he left Sensei, him and Shanti
partnered together and they started
[SPEAKER_00]: taking, they already knew what strains
they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had two NL five hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them we call C five, uh,
which has been spreading around a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit in America now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some people that are selling
seed hybrids of it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finally popped out on our side of
the, of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one was called the one 22 or
the mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to work out a poly
hybrid using skunk haze that would reflect
[SPEAKER_00]: the qualities of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were parallel breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what they were doing is old
school breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge pain in the ass in which
they were taking different scum cases and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were crossing it to these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were growing out the kids
and seeing if the dad threw the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, most people don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as Matt can attest, that's a super
time consuming pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market doesn't let you have a strain
in six years later, release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, it doesn't work in today's
world, but they, he had been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: that for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually they found a skunk haze dad
that meet their criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville preferred the line that you see
five is the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that line became known as super silver
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one three cups in the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably everybody knows about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dante preferred the skunk haze dad crossed
to the one 22 or the mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: My preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one got named the mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also my preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually, the, the one 22 is sadly
not in America yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the nicest and L five haze I've
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal favorite out of the eight
fives, the C fives, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'm an expert on all of them or
anything, but I have in coffee shops and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to know people over there,
smoked most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it lives and you can buy it from
Shanti still, um, the one 22 he it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one 22 by skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also released something that
was the start of his Holy grail project.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Holy grail project was trying to
recapture the magic of haze in an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: line and not F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Neville talked extensively about how
he didn't like most of the poly hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly as much as the F ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was trying to figure out a way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what he did is he took a five,
a five two, which is on the cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Matt wants to show it,
but the a five two is on the cover of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank 89 and 90 catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the a five to this ugly beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the a five to that one and he
crossed it to haze seat and which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: famous dad that, that was used in almost
all the haze releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that was the first time that the a
dad and the C dad was crossed in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 75% haze and 25% Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they initially crossed it just to be a
personal breeding project as their haze
[SPEAKER_00]: grail, but they found so much killer stuff
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided to release it and Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is still a cut of that first find in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the strongest sativa I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a, uh, maybe the best way
to put it is all those old school stories
[SPEAKER_00]: of psychedelic trippy, hold onto your
seat, sativas that make you see tracers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the corner of your vision and make you
like something's talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I kind of believe that was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I smoked Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that Fino that they found that became
famous and it literally felt like the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of my head blew off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dead serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point I had, I had the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a whole bunch of pretty potent,
nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like the stuff we had in America
was mostly superior to what Europe had to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a gentleman who used to work with
Neville became friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a small joint with two friends of
the Neville's haze and it blew my head
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it literally felt like,
like air was rushing over the top of my
[SPEAKER_00]: skull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember holding onto the railing as I
walked down the steps of the dude's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember feeling anxious, stoned tracers
rushing, uh, definitely feelings that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not used to in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at that point I realized that some
of those old sativa stories had the,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were true, that some people did get a
psychedelic, energetic, almost
[SPEAKER_00]: disassociative type of potent feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how used you are to smoking,
whatever Afghans you're used to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance to Neville's haze and you smoke
some, you'll probably get knocked off your
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there is a person in the U S
and, and me and this guy doing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get along the best now, but,
um, in all reality, the best Neville's
[SPEAKER_02]: haze I've ever smoked has come from Snow
High.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had an amazing selection of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he used it in some breeding
work, but it was, uh, every spice you
[SPEAKER_02]: could imagine in a kitchen cabinet all in
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just, it was just so speedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend this, but if you smoke
too much Neville's haze, it feels kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like psychedelic cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just go do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels I mean, but some people,
some people feel like uncomfortable out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your skin, caught in a corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I get that from Afghanis,
which is really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it really, it really, uh, it really
has a strange feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I looked for that Fino in Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought quite a bit of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, luckily that Fino still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still sold in coffee shops over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still people that hold it on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it, it, it was, uh, certain people
don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking hate roller coaster weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it is, it's, it's very tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits you extremely differently than
most things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly was factual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, some of these people
that are making these stories about ties
[SPEAKER_00]: and Colombians and how it made them feel a
long time ago, um, are true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that, that, that cut has it in
spades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's 75% haze, 25% Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first thing that crosses both
haze dads, A and C in the same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been, it's one of my white
rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been searching for it since the
late nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where it exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully after this, we'll have,
I don't know, nine or 10 companies making
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses with it from the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now that we've mentioned it,
everybody's going to have it all of a
sudden.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that thing takes like 16 weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a super long runner, but it
literally yields like three and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if, even if you, even if you were
to take that 16 weeks and turn it into
[SPEAKER_00]: eight weeks, basically like growing an
eight week pounds and a half a light
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes twice as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I, I, I saw, I saw a room in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll tell this story, uh, before it
gets too late, but I walked into a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a room in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all, uh, NL five haze and
Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of the craziest things I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing on a slanted floor with
drains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing in Rockwell croutons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell is very popular in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they were growing in one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was thick, thick stems growing out
of these one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were on, they were on constant drip
slope and drip, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Draining out onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these stems went trimmed up about six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they went up over my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The netting was about six and a half feet
tall, three feet from about six and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: feet to about nine or 10 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a mass jungle of buds
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six hundreds all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: More unusual grow rooms I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it all like vertical bulbs hanging in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they were just way up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, so you look at the ground
and there's these tiny little one gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: of Rockwell croutons with these big,
thick stems coming out of the base that
[SPEAKER_00]: went up more than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right above my head, it just
branched into crazy Sativa arms
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the fruit for the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: These last two episodes, we basically sort
of walked you through Neville's main
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding era, which was 85 to 97,
98.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Super Silver Haze won three cannabis
cups in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 97, 98, 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have heard of Neville's Haze,
Super Silver Haze, Mango Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of the last major breeding that
Neville, not that Neville stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, but he did some much smaller
projects and collabs more with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a bit more about that than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, Neville probably had a
17 year run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good run in this industry of a
really great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through Steve Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, he sold a bunch of,
we were not going to talk about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, this episode, but he sold a bunch of
his stuff and gave a bunch of his cuts to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it continued at Mr. Nice Seeds in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that's kind of Neville's,
as far as his breeding work, that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of his arc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For lack of a better way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, I don't know,
that's probably close to a good stopping
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so everyone, if you, if you want to
get involved in these conversations,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there might be people in the chat
room right now that are actually a part of
[SPEAKER_02]: our Patreon that go into the discord and
we discuss all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these episodes that we are
recording, we do a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: discussions publicly with, uh,
with each other, um, and in that chat
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you, if you're a fucking straight up
strain nerd, come join our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of those other guys can testify
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we also are going to start working on
doing some old cannabis publications,
[SPEAKER_02]: making those accessible for people,
not like high time shit, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's off the radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that has a lot of old strain info,
a lot of old pictures, a lot of old
[SPEAKER_02]: growing info and all that's available
through our Breeders Syndicate Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So join up, be sure to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, uh, we put up the Crowdcast
links in the bio on Breeders Syndicate for
[SPEAKER_02]: each new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to sign up for each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't send notifications every time
unless you sign up for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, uh, that's the housekeeping
details, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, the other thing we could say
is we say this every time we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: discord server that's Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can ask Matt and I questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty responsive on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, we pop in fairly often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to also be doing some shorts
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every subject requires an hour and a
half or something like that to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing a series of shorts
coming up five, 10, 15 minutes about
[SPEAKER_00]: various topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so sometimes your question might not
get talked about, but it might lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 or 15 minute short where we talk about
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we hopefully have some pretty cool old
school breeders that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing on, uh, in the, in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing this on a regular
basis, both the shorts and the long and
[SPEAKER_00]: the long factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't just be me and Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some breeders are shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're going to do our best to add in
some extra people and get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty historical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all that, you can reach us on a
Patron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach us on this, the Breeders
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patron is a damn tequila.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, all that, there's various ways you
can get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep this kind of thing
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it was interesting to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise in the future, Matt will talk
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: They love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but you know, I thank everybody
for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned some things and,
uh, everybody thank you very much for
[SPEAKER_00]: signing up and listening for everybody
that stuck with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, everybody.
