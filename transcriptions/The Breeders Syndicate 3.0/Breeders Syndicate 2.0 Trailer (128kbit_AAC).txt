[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everyone, Matthew Wright here,
host of the Breeder Cynicate podcast and
[SPEAKER_01]: founder of Riot Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just released a new feminized seed
making system called Riot Reversal Spray
[SPEAKER_01]: via our good friends over at Speakeasy
Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Riot Reversal Spray is my own personal
formula that I've used to create feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: strains for over a decade now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can honestly say it is the best ethylene
blocker for dioecious plants that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever thought about creating your
own feminized seeds, this is the product
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
