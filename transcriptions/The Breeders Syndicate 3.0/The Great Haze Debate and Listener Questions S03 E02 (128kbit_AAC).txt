[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: How goes it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this pack and I was like,
Oh my God, there's a shitload of G's LS
[SPEAKER_01]: ones in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I remembered these are the fake
display seeds that I used to put on the
[SPEAKER_01]: counter at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So snag them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't get anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got by myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much it makes me sad sometimes when I
find old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then none of them pop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes from like hope and excitement and
joy to like worry to like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got this in and I'm going to show
it off because it's our buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is seriously a nice fucking
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the turkey and kids from Crybaby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is I mean, that's nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a pro fish.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it'll be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a plan to have him on to talk to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to show it off for him so
people can see before we do the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of cards in here that
just describe everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you how to go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of tips and tricks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's interesting about it is like
they, you know, they have those kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: things for perfumes and like, yeah,
I had some friends that were studying
[SPEAKER_05]: because I live in wine country,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like studying to be so many days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to do that back then,
like this is like 18 years ago or
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would buy these like thousand dollar
kits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Romas were there to teach them
like what an advanced taster was tasting
[SPEAKER_05]: or smelling when they like, you know,
we're talking about Merlot or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were talking about woodsy notes
with hints of raspberry and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to be able to like learn the
language.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they had like a whole book and all
these scents and all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for terpians with weed,
it's like teaching people how to talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a big part.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big thing if you can if you can do
it, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably like most breeders and
weed nerds biggest week week area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know it is for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not I'm not a turp expert by any
stretch of the imagination.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither am I.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and neither are a lot of our
friends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I mean, there's an aspect
where it's like it's just you just lack
[SPEAKER_05]: the language because you don't encounter
how to talk about that language anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terp terpians and like wine sommeliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about using your eyebrows and
like and your eyes to express.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, it's and then it's and
then it's all relative to that human
[SPEAKER_05]: being's ability to taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have I have a really bad sense of
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my taste is really off, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the whole the whole shebang
sucks upstairs here in this region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the whole everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in this region is sucking.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're slowly climbing up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird when I have to do it on this
fucking account.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most people don't know to follow it,
even though I said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you still shadow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Band or whatever on the other one from
doing like I checked it this morning and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like, no, you cannot do lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm used to it by now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, no, people should.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not exactly sure when, but we're going
to have our our buddy crybaby on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he has a lot of knowledge and language
around aromas, terpene, sense what causes
[SPEAKER_05]: smells.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the components of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'll be able to speak a lot more
intelligently than either Matt or I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be soon, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the one that was first telling me
to stop calling skunky shit turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're like the alls and like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's interesting about that is even
like the more like rambling for a while
[SPEAKER_05]: waiting for people to show up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even what's interesting about,
you know, the thing about the alls and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff is how they're evolved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turpines are longer lasting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would always notice about the old
super skunk that I had that the last two
[SPEAKER_05]: or three weeks before harvest and the
first month after cutting it, it was just
[SPEAKER_05]: rank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you kept it long enough,
even if and, you know, in a nice jar in
[SPEAKER_05]: the dark or whatever, it would eventually
just kind of turn into generic green bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find that the more it kept its
moisture content, the longer it lasted in
[SPEAKER_01]: the as it operated?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was actually kind of tough because
it was one of those nugs that you were
[SPEAKER_05]: like, it was famous for like looking
dense, but weighing light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put this thing that you think was a
huge no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, oh, man, this thing's a
massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like two point eight grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it just it had like but it had
really good like air to air to bud ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it burned really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: You snappers of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some bud like like cush is especially and
a lot of this cookie shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really have to cure it right to get it
to burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, you know, but but,
you know, super skunk, you could burn that
[SPEAKER_05]: like pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just had like a good amount of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like Denali saved that cut from
Panda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm real stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're up over.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're one hundred and eight hundred and
ten people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we could start chatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to answer a few questions
first and then maybe you'll get up higher
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I haven't even fucking looked,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just been bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone has asked about mango haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could talk about mango haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mango mango haze is like a super
nice line from Shanti Baba and Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an L5 haze by skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sister to super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it uses this famous cut called the one
twenty two or the mango, which is like my
[SPEAKER_05]: favorite and L5 haze cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's still alive over there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still shown in coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Shanti has it, apparently.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's it's a little bit more
hazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little it's a little like it's got
a little bit more of the flavors that I
[SPEAKER_05]: like.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got less turpentine than super silver
haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't tend to yield as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But but it's a super nice plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's likely one of the ones
where he still has the right parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can't say for nobody can say for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think people still find really nice
plants in that line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just there is a clone only
mango haze, too, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's from the same seed
line, but I know Miami Mango has that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's like a turpentine and mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I've seen some tests on it and
it's turpentine content is pretty off the
[SPEAKER_05]: charts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so that's mango haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of mango haze and super silver
and Neville's haze are kind of like the
[SPEAKER_05]: final three hazes that came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of like one whole era.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so that's starting at the end,
not the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: But.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people in Europe don't like the
skunk hazes quite as much because they
[SPEAKER_05]: felt the skunk aspects kind of overpowered
the the haze, like the more delicate haze
[SPEAKER_05]: aspects that they liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they were always kind of
looking for like bland indicates to cross
[SPEAKER_05]: it to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: To allow, you know, they kind of wanted
like very little turf cuts to blend it to
[SPEAKER_05]: to see if the haze turps would come
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to we're going to chat about
haze tonight, which is a super
[SPEAKER_05]: controversial subject.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a disclaimer, this is just kind of like
our opinion on it and like what we see in
[SPEAKER_05]: the forum day.
[SPEAKER_05]: When things got started, some of the
longest running threads ever were
[SPEAKER_05]: arguments between all these old timers
over haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: On Cannabis World, on Overgrow,
probably on ICMAG, it would just go
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes it would go into the hundreds of
pages of people battling back and forth
[SPEAKER_05]: over what was the real haze story.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my one of my good friends over on
Mr. Nice did probably what I think was the
[SPEAKER_01]: best treatise on haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an overview on haze during that time
before anybody else had really been able
[SPEAKER_01]: to track down anyone to talk to my friend
Big Irv off Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see there's someone with that name in
here, but I don't think it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be awesome if I remember him on
Mr. Nice for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irv was a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen him in a long time,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if he's still hanging
around or what the deal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you I think it's still up on Mr.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, I know it's been
considered one of the more accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: histories on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was some stuff we dug up in the
past few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Bodhi found a book about Santa Cruz
or written in Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually mentions a few of them by
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the first things we found
where there were other names in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, full names.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so there's an aspect where like,
you know, haze has a history dating back
[SPEAKER_05]: to like the late 60s, early 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's hard enough to decipher stuff that
happened 15 or 20 years ago, much less
[SPEAKER_05]: sporty.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of forgive me,
hazy stuff around the origins of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on those threads, there's tons of
arguing that's gone on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's tons of arguing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's, you know, Sam Skunkman has
his version.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, he's posted under different
names about things he claims to have been
[SPEAKER_05]: a neighbor to those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what's fairly well accepted is
it started out as Colombian by Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could start there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Colombian by Colombian from import
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they grew it in greenhouses in Santa
Cruz and areas that were mild like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you needed those mild temperatures
in order to take it till December or
[SPEAKER_05]: January or whenever the hell it was that
they pulled it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: They hadn't figured out depths or anything
like that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it got pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't Matt has a poster somewhere of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got early on got named and got kind of
legendary.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was sold high end in New
York, I believe, for, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: quite a bit at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was considered like the super
kind of sewer weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say all this is pretty like
standard and not argued about that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that much that much it's it's
considered to be correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that much is considered one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you get into like who's responsible
for what and what happened when and how
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where it gets kind of dicey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically what seems like and there's
a lot of stuff where you read online where
[SPEAKER_05]: it'll talk about like it's a Colombian by
Indian by Thai by Mexican.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Sam swears that it's colo by
colo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and all that stuff was added way
later and isn't really part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember he said the Indian was added
way later, if at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that his claim or not?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he said that the Indian was in
there, but it was like it was added as a
[SPEAKER_05]: separate hybrids he offered and never got
mixed in with the, you know, with the core
[SPEAKER_05]: with the core amount of hate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we always had separate haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, when it really boils down to
it or whatever, it just seems like haze
[SPEAKER_05]: was, you know, a mix of Colombian strains
or whatever that they got out of seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: from import.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they got lucky and admittedly it
doesn't seem like they knew what the hell
[SPEAKER_05]: they were doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, and it got pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a lot of stories and a lot
of mystery between late sixties and mid
[SPEAKER_05]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's stories out of Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a series of brothers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wrote some stuff in high time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's all these various things and,
and, uh, you know, they're, they've been
[SPEAKER_05]: debated ad nauseam other places.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we don't need to like delve into
that part because you can find that
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what is part of it is that what's
indisputable is that in 84, 84 ish or so,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, Sam's Guntman brought it to Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these guys grew haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they were growing it in Santa Cruz
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it was a mix of sativas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, mostly Colombian and it was getting
sold in New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at some point Sam took a version
of it to Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as we can tell, he,
um, you know, he gave it to three people,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave it to, uh, uh, positronics who he
actually worked with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he gave it to Correll from,
uh, super sativa seed club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that Correll talked about when we
interviewed him and he gave it to Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, all three, all three of those
guys, um, made hybrids with it and sold
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds, um, from that and pretty much all
haze that we can really, we can really
[SPEAKER_05]: trace, uh, comes from either those three
people or stock that made that Sam made
[SPEAKER_05]: himself in Amsterdam later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Off seats he kept for himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we really don't have any verified
American haze, do we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have, we have the original that
we all agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody agrees that Lund was a
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, debatable on the, the lady,
Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's debatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have, I'm just going to say first
name since it doesn't really, neither here
[SPEAKER_01]: nor there, but, um, there is one guy who
keeps all the posters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as he explained it to me was that the
posters were hung up in the dealers houses
[SPEAKER_01]: that were verified, legit haze dealers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how they verify if they
were getting real haze or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that poster was in their room,
then they knew that they were getting
[SPEAKER_01]: legit haze there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how he told it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if it's true or not, I don't know,
but he seems to have the lion's share of
[SPEAKER_01]: the original posters and he got them
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and then like a lot of those
things, like not everybody, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: not everybody involved, uh, probably has
told their story publicly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: By any means.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and you know, there's a few people
that are loud about it that insist they
[SPEAKER_05]: know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but what we know is it made it there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It made it to Amsterdam and everybody's
all the stuff that made haze famous sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of came from Amsterdam back to America.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, it didn't, it wasn't like
haze popped up here and kept rocking and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's rocking that guy from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we don't know is it seems like,
you know, when we interviewed Corel from
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Santiva seed club, he gave us a
pretty interesting tidbit and that,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Sam only, he didn't think Sam had that
many seeds of it because he only gave him
[SPEAKER_05]: like 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he thought that he only gave Neville
some Neville disputes that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but be that as it may, um,
you know, uh, um, Neville ended up
[SPEAKER_05]: probably making the most famous hybrids
with it by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could say that, you know, um,
but positronics had it as well original.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so did, uh, Super Santiva seed club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all had originals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like when you read the
stories about what Neville and all the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest of them did is that, uh, they were
kind of like us growing, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's kind of like the sour that,
you know, a lot of the starting stories,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was like a bunch of kids that were
young that didn't know what the fuck they
[SPEAKER_05]: were doing at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and they made a bunch of rookie
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they weren't used to growing
something that took 22 weeks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a jungle plan and you know,
and it seems like a number of them got
[SPEAKER_05]: lost by everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Accidents didn't, you know, mom got
killed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't think it was worth much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took, you know, 25 weeks and never
finished.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, um, they didn't realize what kind
of gold they had.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much hindsight needed for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had, they had no idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Neville, Neville had, you know,
a few males and a few females that he
[SPEAKER_05]: burned through and didn't keep,
um, before he, you know, he ended up,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he ended up only by 1990.
[SPEAKER_05]: He only had one plant that had lived.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so someone keeps asking,
did Sam get invited?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam's never wanted to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, I mean, to be honest, that's why I
said it first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you want to hear Sam's opinion
about it, um, there, you could go hunt on
[SPEAKER_05]: overgrow, you know, archives or something
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's posted a ton on his opinion
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, there's not a shortage of Sam's
written history.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we didn't focus on it for that
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, he disagreed with me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, Kathy part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said that the granddaddy Mike was
incorrect on that, you know, that that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be true, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, uh, that's what little I know
from him after I told the story the last
[SPEAKER_01]: time based on granddaddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's the one thing that he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it was, it was very good,
but that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reason why we kind of glossed over
that part is that it's the hardest part to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about because it's the least
documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's a bunch of history from
a bunch of people doing some black market,
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal shit in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All trying to stay onto the radar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as, um, as far as the,
uh, you know, the Hayes goes and everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: knows Hayes, what we just mentioned
positronics, uh, Neville's stuff and super
[SPEAKER_05]: sativa seed club and Sam are the sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That all the Hayes that we talk about now
descends from, yeah, that's where that's
[SPEAKER_05]: where it all comes from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's either hybrids they made or
descendants of it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the companies like the flying
Dutchman or any of these different groups,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, seeds men that sold pure Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe they were all just buying kilos
wholesale from Sam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to be able to ask him for sure,
but it sounds like he was doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: reselling like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he basically, what it sounds like
is to not get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, he didn't sell directly to anyone
outside of Holland because seed sales
[SPEAKER_05]: within Holland were legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was willing to wholesale,
um, but he wasn't willing to retail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he ended up working through
positronics.
[SPEAKER_05]: He ended up, I mean, that's how,
I mean, you know, it's funny when people
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about all this, like rare skunk one
that used to exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we asked Corell about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just laughed and he said, everyone gets
skunk one from, you know, buying bags of
[SPEAKER_05]: seed from Sam Scott, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you got your skunk one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but getting back to Hayes,
it's someone asked about the AC taste
[SPEAKER_01]: related to Santa Cruz, original Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was just going to say that's,
that's my ultimate one who was British.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really highly doubt it was sourced
via Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just my, my theory on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think, I think they sourced it
through posse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who, who I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Tom Hill's Hayes line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine was positron.
[SPEAKER_05]: His was, and it was, his was very
different from the old timer Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, um, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All Tom Hill's work and stuff and the,
and the deep chunk hybrids and all that
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff about positronics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they, uh, um, that was all from,
uh, for a while there, Sam worked with on
[SPEAKER_05]: some fashion at posse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm helping them breed and dude working
with Werner and stuff like that and
[SPEAKER_05]: helping them breed different stuff and,
and working lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And positronics was just one of those
early seed companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, when Sam first moved to
Amsterdam, he was looking for connections,
[SPEAKER_05]: people to sell seeds to and people to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he kinda ended up dealing with
everyone in town, but that was only like a
[SPEAKER_05]: few dudes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really like ongoing then or
whatever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And positronics also, like a lot of people
don't know this part, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: the positronics Hayes 19 skunk one is what
gave birth and is the same thing as the
[SPEAKER_01]: metal Hayes that I think Bodhi just
released F threes of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do want like a worked version of
that line, that's a very good way to get
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd never heard numbers until the Correll
interview, but Correll swore that like,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, posse him Neville, they only got like
a handful, like 10 seeds each.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the first time I heard that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, and then Sam held the rest
back that he had for himself to make his
[SPEAKER_05]: own open pollination that he did later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I, you know, I'd never heard that
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but then, you know, Correll was there
and we weren't so, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Neville's dead now, but he claims he
got big bags of old ass seat, but only
[SPEAKER_05]: got, you know, eight or 10 of them to pop
out of the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, you know, and, uh,
so anyway, they, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: he comes to mid eighties or whatever he
comes here and, and, and then he comes,
[SPEAKER_05]: he comes from California to Holland and he
sells hay seeds to multiple different
[SPEAKER_05]: people and then starts working himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the start of Hayes becoming
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it really didn't for at first,
even like the very first thing that Saint,
[SPEAKER_05]: that, uh, Neville offered was actually a
Northern lights crossed to a female hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that was year one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was like this Hayes B that was a
girl and it was NL one Hayes B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then the next year he came out
with NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I knew that part about the B
girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go look in the, in the 88 catalog,
um, he has, I think it's actually a,
[SPEAKER_05]: an L NL one by Ruderalis hybrid and he
crossed it to Hayes B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and he talks about it being female
because he was like trying to,
[SPEAKER_05]: to like tame the, the crazy lead time to
flower it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you out someone saying you're
incorrect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: How sure am I on it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we can, I got, I got the catalogs
around here, but he, the, the first two
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrids he really, he, he really tried to
make was, uh, um, he crossed it to maple
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf Afghan T and, uh, he crossed it to,
um, uh, an L five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And NL five Hayes he re he, he released,
um, uh, the other one, I don't think he
[SPEAKER_05]: released to the public, but he gave to
friends or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a bigger, is this the bigger from mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice forums?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: No see dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've read so many years threads on mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking for, I've been actually
looking for bigger for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you showed up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, he, you know, um, one of the
cool things about mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice is that, um, there was a time in Oh
10, Oh nine, you know, 2010 or something
[SPEAKER_05]: where Neville was very active on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a ton of knowledge about what
happened, uh, dropped both publicly and
[SPEAKER_05]: posts that he made and via DM and
communications with various people that
[SPEAKER_05]: were active at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, on mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice and bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Herb was definitely one of those guys,
um, that was active in communication.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Matt said, he had a great
write-up on the history of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, that you can probably still go read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herb was around when, when, when Neville
came back and I started getting fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: around with him and trying to work the
bubbles and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it kind of petered off on the mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, it really, really took a dive
after all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So somebody has asked a question,
which I'll answer just cause it ties in,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, they w they were asking, did Neville
have both an A and a C male and did he use
[SPEAKER_05]: them to breed in various things?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so what it sounds like, uh,
is that Neville ended up with two guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, the A and the A and the C,
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was easier to use the males because
it was easier to collect pollen and then
[SPEAKER_05]: dust a bunch of Indica females at the
appropriate time than it was to try to
[SPEAKER_05]: deal with the females, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for lack of a better way, he ended up
with a couple of boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, the, uh, the A, uh, he lost in
1989.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a huge seed increase and put all of
his best Indica's in there, like the G 13
[SPEAKER_05]: and the NL five and a bunch of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then him and his workers forgot to
keep a backup in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he bloomed every a male and they all
died and he lost it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after that, uh, so often keeping big
libraries too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he never sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any commercial, he never sold any
commercial amounts of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He popped them himself and gave out
various phenols of it, which we'll get to
[SPEAKER_05]: in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he might, he gave some private amounts
of seed to friends, um, other breeders,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, people early on, you know,
whatnot, but, uh, it was never sold
[SPEAKER_05]: commercially.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything you ever could buy
commercially was the seed dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all NL five haze, all NL five haze that
you could buy from the seed bank or from
[SPEAKER_05]: Sensi seeds was the seed ad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, so that's kind of like what
everybody's got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd bring big herb on the live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if he's ready to just be pop
on on camera all of a sudden, but he's
[SPEAKER_01]: more than welcome to come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no, but I will read, we'll definitely
reach out to you after the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a wealth of knowledge and would be
cool to add to things, but, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so Neville, Neville had an NL
five haze was probably the most famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably what put haze on the map to
be perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and what I mean by that is that it
just made it a permanent part of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: lore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It inundated the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he, you know, in 89 and 90,
the pictures on the front of his catalog
[SPEAKER_05]: were an NL five haze a, a huge running
colas, big bud, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was that and super skunk ended up
being him and Sensi's best friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Selling seed lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So NL five haze kind of changed the game
and, um, it was super potent and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: probably, I've said it on shows with Matt
before, in my opinion, it's probably the
[SPEAKER_05]: most successful hybrid ever made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if it's because like the line was
kicking out more keepers, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that people wanted, or just because
so many were sold, you were eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: going to find a keeper because it wasn't
super easy to find keepers and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it, I never found a fucking keeper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bought, I definitely, I bought
plenty of packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, not plenty, but I mean, I probably
bought seven or eight packs in the,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the, in the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then other people from that same year
and same era as me, uh, there's things
[SPEAKER_05]: that are still traded today that were
found right around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just the miss.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the mystery of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find it in one and you might not
find it in 200.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, you know, um, but it seems like
that, that strain was consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: From somewhere to 89 to the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Neville says they lost the NL five mom
before he left sensei, which was in 95,
[SPEAKER_05]: 96.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, and, and, and basically like all
the, um, all the haze that we know of all
[SPEAKER_05]: the phenos that have been kept all seem to
trace back to that late eighties through
[SPEAKER_05]: mid nineties era.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a fun, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a fucking bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shit load.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there may not even be identified
as an all five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like bull rider might be an all five days
based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Old Betsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sister of bull rider or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so what ends up happening is that,
um, maybe we can like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's interesting, uh, bigger because
we've always wondered, there's been a
[SPEAKER_05]: rumor that the Cuban black, um,
could have been from gifted seeds to
[SPEAKER_05]: someone that Neville knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it could be, it could have
been a, in that case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I've heard that rumor too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, I poo poo, the Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a fuck what anyone says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, at least the clone circulating
right now in the community, because I knew
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly who brought it in and that dude
kept fucking lying about everything he
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's very, I'm very skeptical,
skeptical with what, uh, with what goes
[SPEAKER_01]: around today as a Cuban black case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be some kind of L five pays,
but it is not the original.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what, what, you know, I mean we
can, you know, we were bouncing around and
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize because it's like a
multi-decade story or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah, basically, uh, and we can dive
into different parts of different times,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, um, basically between, you know,
89 and 95 or so there's probably like,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, 10 or 15 elites, maybe a few more that
have survived from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Era that are all named cuts and still held
onto.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, of mostly NL five haze, um,
whether it uses the a dad of the C dad,
[SPEAKER_05]: but some G 13 haze, some hash plant haze,
um, various different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've only ever had the hash
plant haze and hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, um, so basically, yeah, Neville
basically crossed it to like all his best
[SPEAKER_05]: indicates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it got crossed the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got crossed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got crossed to G 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got crossed to NL five.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got crossed to NL one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, anything that he had, there was an
Indica that he thought was a bomb clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, God, you know, so, so that's kind of
where like people are talking PIF isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: All this, we'll get to that in a second,
but basically what happened is,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that there's a whole series we can talk
about of famous clones in Europe that
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville hunted and found and then passed
out to France.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those got, those got held and like
some people call them the Southern,
[SPEAKER_05]: the, I almost said Southern humble,
the Southern Holland, South Holland crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: South Holland crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and they've been sold in coffee shops
for decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I, when I first went, you know,
to coffee shops in, in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could get NL five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you could get a five.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get C five.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, you get G 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get hash plant haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically every, every trip I went
somewhere had, you know, various versions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were sold and a lot of people came
to Holland to smoke those hazes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was these famous cuts and there's
a lot of them that are 30 years old now or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever that got, um, that got saved in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's like a whole map to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the same time, there was a
bunch of people that were trading seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: with Neville, uh, and buying a bunch of
Neville seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like a combination of New
York and Florida, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it blew up and got super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was markets for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the people in Florida were
actually sending it to New York because it
[SPEAKER_05]: blew up in New York and got a top dollar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's rumors that it's been kind of
a thing in New York since the seventies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always been a high end clientele
of like wall street brokers, musicians,
[SPEAKER_05]: artists, connected people that were
willing to drop big money for haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as I've been a smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could go to New York and find haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder why that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just caught on and never, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like Dominican crews picked up on
it in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder why certain ethnic groups just
navigated to that specific type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it that New Yorkers just tend to like
more speedy weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, in this case,
the best haze in the world, in my opinion
[SPEAKER_05]: is in Amsterdam and, you know,
New York and Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The West coast gets jacked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we literally, we get Jack and super
silver haze and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like we get a lot of hybrids of that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are more like the poly hybrids
that came later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, uh, you know, they, on the East
coast, they have a bunch of F ones and S
[SPEAKER_05]: ones of F ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and there's a, people are
going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's people talk about names
like heights, haze, downtown Brown,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, PIF, church, uh, Cuban black,
um, you know, it seems like there was
[SPEAKER_05]: groups of Dominicans and groups of Cubans
that had it on lockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people call it block work,
uh, because they could get it on the
[SPEAKER_05]: block.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was green haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Brown haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really hard if you're not from
there, uh, to know all the different,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, are they Finos?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they the same thing grown different
ways?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they called different hybrid names is,
I mean, I, I talked to some people that
[SPEAKER_05]: were in the know, and I used to think that
it was like, you know, half a dozen names
[SPEAKER_05]: for the same couple cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it turns out that in the 30 years that
haze has been popular in New York and
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida, there's a fucking plethora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even, there's like Pude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wondered what that stood for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weird word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's all kinds of nicknames and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what's crazy about the haze is that
the, and don't take any offense to this
[SPEAKER_05]: anyone, but like the Cubans and the
Dominicans and whoever that were running
[SPEAKER_05]: it, they viewed it very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they held that shit fucking tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't into, into sharing it with
trading.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had like a market and their market
was good and they were into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's dudes that I've talked to that
like their entire career, basically just
[SPEAKER_05]: grown haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's all they needed to do was
grow haze, get it to New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't share that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but what's interesting about that is
like, unlike a lot of like random cuts you
[SPEAKER_05]: get, like where you kind of have to get
the cut, a lot of those dudes,
[SPEAKER_05]: once they realized they couldn't get the
real cut, they just went and bought beans
[SPEAKER_05]: because you can still buy the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you buy, you know, and it's like,
imagine if your buddies are selling it for
[SPEAKER_05]: a ton of money, you might go to Amsterdam
and buy a hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And come back and pop a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden you've got the,
you know, I've got, I've got the PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got the Cuban.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black, you know, my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, this is a, I remember bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to push a bunch of these off
on him because I knew like no one wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I got the PIF, the Dominicans
asked me not to release it pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only request they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't release it pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't going to fucking snub that,
you know, like you don't want to piss
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never did, but I really regret it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they have a, there's a market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't claim to be an expert.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's, there's different people
we could probably bring on maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the future that know a lot more about
the various names and origins of the
[SPEAKER_05]: various different haze things from New
York.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to bring it up in general
that there's a bunch of cuts that get
[SPEAKER_05]: passed around in Florida and New York
more, but, but Florida too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and a bunch in Holland and between
those two areas, that's like 15 different
[SPEAKER_05]: cuts at least a bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's probably the line that has the
most we're lucky if one or two Finos of
[SPEAKER_05]: any famous thing survives from the
nineties to today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you think of any other line from that
era that has as many cuts as NL five haze
[SPEAKER_05]: does that still float around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even close, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to find a single lot of
these lines, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and so, you know,
some of this stuff, people are talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about gold or brown haze or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in my opinion, uh, and I've seen it in
like chem four and I've seen it in various
[SPEAKER_05]: strains, you know, certain strains just
when it, when they're, when they're around
[SPEAKER_05]: oxygen, they sort of cure a little bit
brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to get, remember like the,
the real cherry pie when it was growing
[SPEAKER_05]: would be like deep purple and would look
all crazy when I did it depths.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I dry it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And three weeks later, it would,
the, the, the purple would turn a little
[SPEAKER_01]: light brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated that about like blackberries too,
like that beautiful magenta red as it
[SPEAKER_01]: dries, it turns us this nasty brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those, some of those haze
crosses turn brown as they dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Colombian influence, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it might be terpy as all get out
and fresh and smell delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone looks at it and they're like,
this shit's old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have old weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just like, it's a, it's a,
uh, you know, I mean, even like we,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, we were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking about it earlier today,
but I have a buddy who made the chocolate
[SPEAKER_05]: top, the, uh, the chocolate diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, and that stuff, it's basically a
chocolate tie by dog by sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had it for a long time and no one
wanted to ever buy it because it cured a
[SPEAKER_05]: light brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the chocolate part wasn't so much,
it smelled like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was that the tie was brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and like Perel said back in the
day, they wanted that brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that brown was, it was good brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't like it was fucked up,
but it just a little yellow, a little
[SPEAKER_05]: brown, little off colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's crazy about haze is that that
is like death on the West coast,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Brown, any kind of brown color at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like doom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can see people in the comments or
whatever talking about all the uptown
[SPEAKER_05]: Browns.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I give me that Brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so, uh, there's a bunch of stuff
like that where I can name them real
[SPEAKER_05]: quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when we talk about A or C it's just
basically like a Holland shorthand for,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, which may, which haze male of Nevels
was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's at least three C fives,
um, that float around Holland that are
[SPEAKER_05]: still alive for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, one of them is the, is, is called the
one and that's the mom of a super silver
[SPEAKER_05]: haze and it's floats around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually in America right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's what people, some people,
if you see people posting in America of C
[SPEAKER_05]: five, it's that cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the C five cut in America is the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The C five cut in America is the,
it's like the turpentine bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what made super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: So turpentine dominant, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, you know, and so it,
it's, um, it's being passed around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It made it over the, and it's really
amazing, uplifting, super potent weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just, you have to be able to handle
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't like turpentine, it's going
to be a real problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoked turpentine all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and so there's like three C
fives.
[SPEAKER_05]: The final C five was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to smoke it over there in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the, they call it the one 22 or the
mango and it's the mom of mango haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just takes, it has more of that
mercy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, uh, I don't forget, I forget
what the turf is that leads to mangoes,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it smells like ripe mangoes and it's
got a great high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, C five isn't SSH.
[SPEAKER_05]: C five is the mom of SSH.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone just said, so, so then there's a,
there's three cuts of C five, at least
[SPEAKER_05]: over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two cuts of a five.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say there's a G 13 a, there's a G 13
C there's a hash plant by C.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I might be missing a couple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but, but there's a bunch of
them over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, and then most of the ones in
America are, are, you know, NL five cross
[SPEAKER_05]: the C.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, even I should mention too that,
um, Neville gave Soma of Soma seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: some G 13 a, and he took a mail of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of Soma's, uh, sativa and hazy
lines are based off that, that mail that
[SPEAKER_05]: he kept, uh, from some G 13 a seeds that
he got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what it seems like, uh,
Neville was pretty open about this on,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, on the, uh, on the forums over there
was, uh, haze does not like being crossed
[SPEAKER_05]: to itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: At all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what becomes hard is, especially with
the C, the more you cross haze to itself,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Neville called it cat piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would probably, uh, we would probably
call it, um, uh, turpentine, but,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the more you cross it, you get
turpentine dominant and then only rarely
[SPEAKER_05]: do others any kind of, and that's what
everybody thinks of is Jack, Jack turps,
[SPEAKER_05]: train wreck turps, uh, super silver haze,
uh, super silver haze turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that's kind of stuff tends to
dominate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what it seems like is the best ones,
the ones that everybody keeps are the F
[SPEAKER_05]: ones of haze to some Indica and the poly
hybrids like super silver haze,
[SPEAKER_05]: mango haze, uh, Jack Herrera, that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't seem to be as people don't seem
to have keepers of those the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not cuts of them that don't float
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but we should mention too,
cause it's fucking, we're kind of,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's kind of like a ramble or whatever,
but most of these things are, they're one
[SPEAKER_05]: of the most unique things about haze is
that most of the good ones take between 12
[SPEAKER_05]: and 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: A long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I think the Cuban blacks and a lot of
the ones in New York, 90 to a hundred days
[SPEAKER_05]: is a pretty common, uh, rate to take those
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dog shit, which is about the only West
coast one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's any good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that one's 12, 13 weeks easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, all this stuff from Europe,
uh, you know, was, is all 15, 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so that was one of the
things that Neville and Shaunty and all
[SPEAKER_05]: those guys that were fucking around with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of their criteria was they didn't want
anything longer than 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was impractical because asking
someone to flower something for four
[SPEAKER_05]: months is already impractical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if it's a money making thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so there's an aspect where it's
like, I, uh, you know, they cut it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted 14 to 16 weeks, you know,
and it seems like the earliest good ones
[SPEAKER_05]: are more like 12 and 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but 14 to 16 seems to be the most
common range that a lot of them fall into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a big fan of the old SOG super
silver haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of my favorites that ran
pretty quick and was mostly skunk one
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean those, you know, the super silver
haze and the mango haze were both,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, two different NL five haze moms
crossed to the same skunk haze dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the skunk helps like throw,
especially in the super silver,
[SPEAKER_05]: it helped it throw bigger, longer,
thicker colas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it could shorten up the time a whole
bunch in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, so, you know, they,
so then it just became going back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just became fucking famous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody had haze and all these seed
companies wanted to obscure exactly how
[SPEAKER_05]: they got haze, but haze just became haze
for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sort of shorthand for sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the sativa, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and, uh, it got famous in
America.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got famous over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all these various different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it seems like, you know,
like I said, the F ones seem to be a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: better than the poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the poly hybrid hybrids weren't
nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've, I've grown nice super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had keepers of mango haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved, um, but it seems like all the
most favorite ones are F one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some type of Afghani or Paki crossed
the haze across the haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, two very different things slapped
together and then you see what they get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even with those things crossed to it,
still the keepers were 14, 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So essentially like you're taking some
Colombian and like shortening it from 20
[SPEAKER_05]: to 24 to 14 to 16.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a Colombian black go up to 26.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so people are talking about
PIF.
[SPEAKER_05]: PIF is just, you know, PIF is a catchall
term.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, um, it's one of the nicknames to haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people can argue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to sit there and say that I
have some encyclopedic knowledge of how
[SPEAKER_05]: all the New York haze terms came about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it got a bunch of, it was popular
enough for long enough that it has a bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of nicknames, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said it before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heights haze, uptown Brown, Cuban black,
um, blog work, PIF, church, Frankie short
[SPEAKER_01]: for frankincense, you know, um,
all that, all that different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there said Pude stands for pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that's what it meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's Colombian for pure
Dominican for pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a lot of nicknames.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and probably just like Kush and
just like cookie, just like everything
[SPEAKER_05]: else that got popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: People got bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: People got lines from Amsterdam still and
pop their own thing and added their own
[SPEAKER_05]: name to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they're trying to cash in on the
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really hard to say, but rarely,
you know, that line was available for
[SPEAKER_05]: seven or eight years.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an idea for a little game we can
play.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to name a few different haze
cuts and you're going to say pass or
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and you're going to be passing it to
an idiot or you're going to smoke it
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a five smoke smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: C five.
Smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew you'd go for both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you smoked all Betsy?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, haven't tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or bull rider, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, I haven't even smoked for a
bull rider that I know of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it just wasn't, it had already died
out by the time I got San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of some, some good
hazy cuts that you've tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Kelly missed smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing you're not going to smoke
that has haze in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I think about it, I don't think I
could name one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you, I could, yeah, I, I would,
there's, there's not really a Jack I've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen that I wished I had a jar on my,
on my, on my, on my shelf there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jack, you're going to pass on a Jack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would pass on the Jack or pass on Jack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack to me is like huge yielding skunk one
on a haze frame.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's like, just,
I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the type of turpentine that Jack
is, is not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like it doesn't taste good to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I know people love it,
you know, and people loved it cause they
[SPEAKER_05]: got two, three pounds of light with it and
they crushed it in depths and greenhouses
[SPEAKER_05]: and they basically grew the shit out of it
until the buyers were like, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried amnesia yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amnesia is some water down shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was, it's one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of my favorites by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's so like perfumey fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just nice, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like, I like the, I like the
church, the frankincense, the mercy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't, I'm not a turpentine hater by any
means.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I mean, like I said,
C5 is a turpentine bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a difference to me between
turpentine that has a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: sweetness or creaminess behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, I just sprayed my mouth with
like floor cleaner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, that turpentine, you know,
it's like, and I think for Jack and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, there was just a bunch of badly
grown Jack and it over, just like train
[SPEAKER_05]: wreck, you know, it overwhelms people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like that Durbin, um,
that Durbin from Colorado or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: that one's a turpentine bomb too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure is super turpentine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it's like, I liked,
there's all kinds of weed I smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a hater on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but when I, when I, the, the
interesting part to me is it's not so much
[SPEAKER_05]: the only thing I can think of that's like
really strong turpentine that I love the
[SPEAKER_05]: high is the C5.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how that does it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know why that is,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, but they, uh, you know,
what's cool about it is that because it
[SPEAKER_05]: made money in coffee shops, for so long
and still does, um, it's still hoarded
[SPEAKER_05]: over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people accuse us reporting that shit
is legit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Horted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people put stipulations on those
fucking cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like there are certain seed lines
like me and Caleb can never release.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because they'll be, they'll be super
pissed off and people will be angry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, and you know, it's been
monetized over there for so long and been
[SPEAKER_05]: sold in coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you got the cuts, you had to give
kickbacks to the dudes that I was like
[SPEAKER_05]: very, so those things it's like,
and they don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to trade you for shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have what they have and they don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like the ultimate hoarding
because honestly, um, they didn't slip out
[SPEAKER_05]: until Neville died.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire time that he was alive,
that shit was on lockdown with those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two, only two of those cuts,
maybe more, but only, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, I love that one of the sources for
those cuts, I was sent a list with those
[SPEAKER_01]: on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I want those two and the dude
didn't even know what the fuck they were
[SPEAKER_01]: until I told him what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the biggest mistake I ever
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't like to dip people and be
like, you know, I'm not, I want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to trade equal values.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if they find out later,
it's rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: They at least got the worth, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the hard, the hard part is the
hard part is that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: these things would never be popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to, you really have to
like the high, um, because you should know
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're growing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I see a lot of people asking me
about the a five S ones and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be a super like a
marketable commercial crop nowadays that
[SPEAKER_01]: would sell really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people have this like fantasized
idea because you're saying it's dank and
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they respect your word.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand what it was with,
with this definition of dank would look
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dank and ugly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like I mentioned before,
like people were talking on the thing
[SPEAKER_05]: about how much they love the uptown Brown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't sell uptown Brown in
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: No fucking way.
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if I agree with you and I say that
weeds amazing, it still wouldn't sell
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, if you see the pictures of a
five, there's no resin production anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: on any leaf for miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just look at it and be like,
fuck, that dude sucks at growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ugly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it works, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you really have to be into the
high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like there are all these Dutch.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like trying to hoard it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Americans are going to like fuck with
their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you really have to be a consumer,
like a lover of cannabis because it takes
[SPEAKER_05]: four months.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to plan that it's going to
take twice as long as the rest of your
[SPEAKER_05]: shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to keep it happy and healthy
and bug free and P and all the various
[SPEAKER_05]: issues free that long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it don't wash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, and then you get some
great weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so so it's not, you know, but in
Holland, it's like all my first
[SPEAKER_05]: experiences with smoking, all those ones
were all Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I could tell a story that people
people might like.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went and saw this room in Holland
that was growing Neville's Hayes and C5
[SPEAKER_05]: and then one twenty two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I go into this room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was one of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only met Neville a couple of times,
but it was one of his partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I go into this room and it's like
there's like one gallon pots on the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: With those grow Dan like Rockwell,
Rockwell croutons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like the little croutons,
little croutons, little squares.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One gallon pots with these stems coming
out of them that were like that big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those stems went six, seven feet up in
the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so imagine this little one gallon pot
with this stem that's like half as wide as
[SPEAKER_05]: the pot going six feet straight up and
then branches everywhere and like two or
[SPEAKER_05]: three layers of of netting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they just had a bunch of six
hundreds on the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to tell you, I had a conversation
with Seattle Greg the other day and he
[SPEAKER_01]: said when he went into Neville's grow
room, he said when he first got there,
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville was growing Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwell slabs on the ground, on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had drains in there or whatever
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would be like the slowest
constant drip ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was like you're looking at
literally these they were probably 10,
[SPEAKER_05]: 12, 10, 12 foot Paul plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like where the weed was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started at above.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm six, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started above my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I walked in and all the netting was above
my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's these tiny little pots on slow
drip and just like a sea of spears above.
[SPEAKER_05]: How big was the ceiling?
[SPEAKER_05]: How tall are the ceilings?
[SPEAKER_05]: They were pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like 14 feet or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they had to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if the fucking canopy starts at
the top of your head, that's the canopy
[SPEAKER_05]: started.
[SPEAKER_05]: The canopy started about seven feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about half a foot above my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from seven to 10 feet was where most
of the weed was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the lights were hanging off the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like six feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you looked and there was like a sea
of brand of stock coming out of the thing
[SPEAKER_05]: and going up above your head and then
branching out into huge branches all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never seen at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never seen anything like that before
in my life because people are confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying they thought you were five
foot 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm five foot 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm six, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was above my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, what's crazy about that is
that their drip system fails.
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance, that shit's dead in like two
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what's always scared me about
like drip systems, feeds, hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was literally on like the
slowest drip you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was basically constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's constant feed during the
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so yeah, it was it was pretty.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's how they grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was Neville's Hayes and the Mango
Hayes and the C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those were all grown for coffee shops
at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and they were dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the Neville's Hayes is is a five
foot five by Hayes C, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the cut that I love still exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that it gets sent over to America
sometime.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck are you laughing at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's down my height.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's short as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Liars.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's he's short.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's he's he's short, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by 10 is a little short.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: He might.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Girl Pinocchio knows all my dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some really good Neville's
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's rumor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard to substantiate anything
with Shanti or any of the euro guys in
[SPEAKER_05]: general.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't know if Neville's Hayes is the
same or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone asked if we could break down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Karma's A5 S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Snitch Hayes S1.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, he he reversed the I
don't think the I don't think the I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: think that he's is like being bred even to
even to out crosses of themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he certainly don't want that doesn't
seem like they like to be S1 very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's a lot of ugly in them
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, there's a lot of ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might get one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the problem, too,
is like when it comes to Hayes,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best stuff is going to be three to
four months.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of it's going to be junk,
a bunch of it's going to be jungle weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're not going to know for
forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a long time to frickin,
you know, to get it going.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like I mean, I can tell a story
that I've told privately or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I went out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went out to the Cannabis Cup and I think
it was 98 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the first year that they
released Neville's Hayes seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Neville's Hayes was so everybody
knows.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to be a private breeding
of of Neville's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was trying to make what he called
the Holy Grail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: A Hayes line.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he took he took his favorite a five,
which which was on the cover of the eighty
[SPEAKER_05]: nine and ninety catalog that female.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he threw that on the Hayes sea male.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the first time he tried to
breed both Hayes dads into a single thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they found this cut over there that
was the strongest sativa I've ever smoked
[SPEAKER_05]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked about it before.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy that Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it just never tastes, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It make I mean, it is unbelievably potent
in a way that weed is not normally potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I smoked it over there and it blew
my head off like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It made it hard for me to walk downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like held onto the railing and I felt
disassociated and I felt like it hit me in
[SPEAKER_05]: a way where it made me feel like I was
smoking kind bud with no tolerance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I got it was intense and I got high
for hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I brought some of these seeds home
and I'd never grown an extreme sativa
[SPEAKER_05]: before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going to breed with this fucker
and I grew it for a few months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took some cuttings and then once they
rooted and I knew I had backup copies,
[SPEAKER_05]: I flipped it to see what was up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I flipped it at 1212, you know,
because it's like 1999 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made that mistake before, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it it vegged for months with no
pistols.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just you wait and you're like week seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all my shit's finishing up and it's
barely starting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like I tossed them and then I took
clones and I flowered those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I put more shit in there because
I was trying to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the same fucking thing happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know at the time that a lot
of those guys over there will tell you
[SPEAKER_05]: that if you really want to get your
sativas to do well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clone them a few times and let the plant
itself get to be six or seven months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's its natural veg cycle
before it would even start to bloom in the
[SPEAKER_05]: tropics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to realize it's going to veg
for a long ass time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, no, if you're getting an A5
cut that was popped in 89, you can just
[SPEAKER_05]: flip it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I didn't know anything about 11,
14 or 10, 11, 13 or 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: 14 or anything like that, which is
basically just like for people that don't
[SPEAKER_05]: grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how much hours of light and how much
hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 12, 12 for, you know, 22 years ago or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fine for all my Indica's for
Neville's.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to get it to start, I had to give
it 11 hours of light and 13 hours of
[SPEAKER_05]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had to be over six months old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had to finish it at 10,
14 for like the final six weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I fucked up a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did that with the Malawi,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's the one who taught me that trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would have never I wouldn't even made
sense of it back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't I didn't even make sense of it
until I had a buddy in Amsterdam who grew
[SPEAKER_05]: for Neville and I went back to Europe and
saw him the next year and told him like
[SPEAKER_05]: basically my follies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he just laughed at me and he laid all
that shit out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had I had no idea, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it makes sense when someone says
it like, you know, like, oh, God,
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every other strain I'd ever grown of
cannabis at that point in time,
[SPEAKER_05]: when I turned the lights back to 12,
12, everything I needed to happen
[SPEAKER_05]: happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my first experience with like we
that didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so that's only with extreme
sativa's if it's got enough indicate and
[SPEAKER_05]: it should trigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only if and it's only if it's
from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because seeds know they're young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone was asking if any of us had grown
Cali miss, here's an old original pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: low numbered pack early on of Cali miss
that we haven't popped yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day, not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I mean, it should be said
about the Cali miss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon worked for Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: Its origins are unknown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville thinks that it's an NL five Hayes
a female.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's but he think he you know,
he thought that everything in Europe was
[SPEAKER_05]: based off his work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not surprise.
[SPEAKER_05]: He thought everything in America was based
off his work.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what is interesting is that having
talked to some Dutch people, they say that
[SPEAKER_05]: that the the Cali mist was based off a
mother plant called the mango.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, whether it's the same that whether
it's the same mango that that founded the
[SPEAKER_05]: mango Hayes and the one twenty two or
whether it's a different thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they said for a long time it was alive
in Europe and then it got and then it got
[SPEAKER_05]: lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people talk about Cali missed Western
winds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Western winds has in Kambo in
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the same fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has Kambo in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people that so people that people that
that don't know Tony from Sag Martha and
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon from Sirius had a company that we
talked about before cerebral seeds for one
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they split up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony made Sag Martha seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon made Syria seeds and Simon's version
of the Cali mist was called Cali mist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony's version of the same line was called
Western winds, which is, I think,
[SPEAKER_05]: one of the cooler names in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always like the name Western winds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was a super neat name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just makes me think of gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've heard people in Europe tell me
that they preferred Tony's version to
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon's that the Western winds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, then it's hard to say those
guys don't really reveal parentage.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we don't know what's in the Cali mist.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what's in the bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what's in the AK 47.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But but the 90s Cali mist, Simon got
busted in ninety nine or 2000 when they
[SPEAKER_05]: changed the laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like several of his lines
changed after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Cali mist was one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the 90s, there was some really
amazing Cali mist cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it was a nice line.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so, you know, yeah, it's that's
kind of what happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's like people, you know,
people were getting you could buy them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They called it pure Hayes F 10 member from
from Flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'd straight up tell you 80 percent
of it is junk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten percent of it is is is pretty good and
10 percent of it is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Flying Dutchman said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Tom Hill said that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that in the description,
they talked about they talked about how
[SPEAKER_05]: inbred it was already and that its best
use was for hybrids and outcrossing
[SPEAKER_05]: interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you were trying to find a winner,
be prepared that only less than 10
[SPEAKER_05]: percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd have to do like at least one
hundred one hunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so doing one hundred hundred plant
haze hunt is a fucking nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Expensive and nightmarish because it's
going to be a bunch of jungle weed and the
[SPEAKER_05]: shittiest looking weed could end up being
fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to know until you dry it
and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to know how potent it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be like look resinless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And still take your head off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's cool about it is that it was so
fire that it's become one of the most
[SPEAKER_05]: common names in cannabis and it's been
blended into all kinds of shit for
[SPEAKER_05]: forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Blue Dream has Hayes in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, lots of lots of huge yielding
plants have Hayes in their background
[SPEAKER_05]: because of that stretch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You stretch the yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could throw if you could like Jack
Herrera was basically figuring out a way
[SPEAKER_05]: to get skunk buds on a Hayes frame.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could get a ginormous Hayes
plant with huge skunk running colas and a
[SPEAKER_05]: little NL density, then you're three
pounds of light, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three pounds of light, three pounds of
light, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the days you're supposed to
fucking lollipop on for three pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: light, but I don't remember it anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been we've been rambling about Hayes
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we should talk a little about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Neville made Neville made all these all
these hybrids, only a few of which he
[SPEAKER_05]: ended up selling to the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a bunch like the G 13 Hayes
crosses and the the the silver Hayes,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was Afghan maple leaf Afghan tea by
Hayes and different things he passed out
[SPEAKER_05]: to friends and other people in Amsterdam
and even some people that bought seeds off
[SPEAKER_05]: him early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those things got spread out a little
bit and there was keepers that were found,
[SPEAKER_05]: even though you could never buy G 13 by
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, after that,
he started trying to make poly hybrids and
[SPEAKER_05]: blend them all together and cross various
select cuts he'd found.
[SPEAKER_05]: He tried to cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was trying to do skunk, skunk and hayes
mixed together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he considered those to be like the
three most famous lines in in Holland?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can I get a plant that contains all
three?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it sounds like is it was just a
turpentine nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: G 13 Hayes, all the poly hybrids he was
trying to cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and, you know, he so I went to
the first cup I went to was the jacket.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a cup in 1995 Cannabis Cup in
Amsterdam, which is the only place that
[SPEAKER_05]: they were.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in 95, Ben and Alan drunkers.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was actually I guess, you know,
it was 95.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Ben and Alan drunkers wanted to have a
commemorative release because the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: theme for that that cup was Jack Herrera
and the Emperor Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the impact that Jack Herrera had on
the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was all these going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: One second.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was all there was all this there
was all this theme or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Neville had been working on this
this NL five Hayes by Skunk Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he hadn't really found what he wanted
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Ben and Alan drunkers, because they
were at Sensi and sent and Neville was at
[SPEAKER_05]: Sensi at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They convinced him to release this sort of
like not ready for primetime thing and
[SPEAKER_05]: call it Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so that's how the Jack Herrera came
about was they had they already had a
[SPEAKER_05]: phenol of it that they had at the cup that
they had flour at the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they they released Jack Herrera
as a seed line at Sensi seeds that at the
[SPEAKER_05]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a big debut was you could
buy Jack Herrera at the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I had my Jack Herrera ninety
five poster here, but I don't want real
[SPEAKER_01]: quick anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so Jack got Jack got Jack got released
Jack supposedly is the genesis of fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: Brothers Grimm C 99 is bag seed from a
coffee shop in Amsterdam of Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the supposed is the supposed origins or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be half Jack or full Jack.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, supposedly if you believe
him, it was found in a bud of Jack Herrera
[SPEAKER_05]: bought at a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he brought it home and did shit with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Neville wasn't satisfied with the with
Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_05]: He felt it was still unfinished and he
left.
[SPEAKER_05]: He left Sensi later that year and he kept
working on the project and he got Shanti
[SPEAKER_05]: Baba to help him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they basically they had the mothers
that they wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were going to use the C five and the
one twenty two and they kept trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: find different skunk Hayes dads that would
do what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And according to them, it took a long time
and a bunch of different males and a bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of different growing shit out and a bunch
of pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: But after a few years, they found a skunk
Hayes dad that worked and Neville
[SPEAKER_05]: preferred that skunk Hayes crossed to the
C five and Shanti preferred that same dad
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed to the one twenty two and they
couldn't agree on which one was the better
[SPEAKER_05]: line and better representative.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they released both and they called the
skunk Hayes by C five the super silver
[SPEAKER_05]: Hayes and they called the mango Hayes by
same skunk dad mango Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, super silver Hayes is one that
I've actually ran a bunch of and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: one that I had the hardest time finding
keepers in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have smoked others keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, the old socks always one of
my favorite, but there are some really
[SPEAKER_01]: good keepers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just never had luck with super.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I brought I brought some to I think our
party a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't mine wasn't super elite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say it was a nice cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It yielded like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great to death and great to grow
outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it had a lot of qualities you want in
mold resistance and just general
[SPEAKER_05]: happiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it had a lighter penalty base or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But but so basically super silver Hayes
and Neville and mango Hayes are two
[SPEAKER_05]: sisters crossed to the same dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so they're pretty close,
but they're just different.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, super silver Hayes tends to be
more to penaline.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mango Hayes tends to be a bit more mercy
and commit more and more mango style.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to I like the mango Hayes better as
a Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The super silver Hayes is a crazy
production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I've had some euros tell me like
Gene Finder that there was a super silver
[SPEAKER_05]: Hayes in Europe that was like a 14 week or
that was like their all time favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that one seems lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was an outlier that was a more
hazy, more, you know, more, more,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, less gunk, more Hayes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was supposedly phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in a poly hybrid, it's going to be
hard to to find something, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville complained that none of his poly
hybrid work was as nice as any of the F
[SPEAKER_05]: ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter how hard he tried, they just
weren't quite as good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I will say that that Neville
Hayes that he made, it's the most potent
[SPEAKER_05]: sativa I've ever tried in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that cut still exists in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think most breeders or seed makers
even talk about the failures anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's because most of Instagram and
social media is marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess it doesn't pay to talk about
your failures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I mean, you know what the
greatest cure for powdery mildew was?
[SPEAKER_05]: What comes to Graham?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never see it gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one ever struggles with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it gets curated out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, oh, this is a beautiful bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's like one spot of, you know,
of mildew on a family for your whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're just like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember, you know, this is a little off
topic, but I do remember when Swerve's
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali Connection story came out in high
times and he was so proud and you fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: took pictures of it through it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing everyone sees is big
old powdery mildew fucking spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over his leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to get grilled if you'd show up
with powdery mildew on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the Internet culture kind of
negated that because people would get
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking railed on seeing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to know how I'm I'm not big on
conspiracy theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I'll tell a story that most
people don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is that the thing that sent powdery
mildew into northern California,
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendo and Humboldt and made it forever an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was Osama bin Laden and 9-11.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 9-11 happens, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's September 11th.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he crashes.
[SPEAKER_05]: He crashes these airliners into the twin
towers, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody's all freaked out and they
shut down airliners for three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were worried about them al Qaeda
planning biological attacks on cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they grounded all America's spray
planes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they couldn't spray biological agents
for eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from September.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from September 11th all the way through
September, all the way through October,
[SPEAKER_05]: no spray pains could be in Marin,
in Sonoma, in Napa, in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't have spray plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how a bunch of those places
controlled powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then in the Santa Rosa paper,
which is the big town in Sonoma
[SPEAKER_05]: afterwards, you see things like Robert
Mondavi and other people losing millions
[SPEAKER_05]: of dollars in grapes this year to powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of those vineyards are all right
by the highway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I shit you not, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 90s and in 2000, 2001, all the
hydro stores I would go into, none of them
[SPEAKER_05]: had any powdery mildew control.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of my friends had powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Powdery mildew was something that you got
like outdoor maybe in October,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe a touch here and there if you got
unlucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never saw it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never saw it indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never, ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not not a single clone ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And within two months of 9 11 happening,
every single one of my friends had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then within a year or two,
every hydro store had a whole shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's how to kill the ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was stuff there was
biologicals like AQ 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there was there was,
you know, you know, there was learning
[SPEAKER_05]: about how to kill that ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how to get rid of it was
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really bunk because it looked like
in the beginning it wasn't fucking up your
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it really fucked up your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it really fucks it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like you think spider mites
are fucking up your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not really fucking up your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really, really messing with your
herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it took a number of years to figure
out how to not transfer it, how to you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, no one had ever dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had never seen it like the first two,
three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lived in California for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I never saw a single indoor my
friends or myself that ever had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once it became.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then if you if you think about it,
right, imagine thousands of acres of
[SPEAKER_05]: grapes kicking off clouds as the highway
drives by a PM that they can't treat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just it just it just got all over
people's fucking tires.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got kicked in the air.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's like it's been I'm not
saying that that's the only reason,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's been a problem ever since.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In all honesty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all those clones from NorCal get
spread out all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people get PM and they don't know
how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know how to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and it's, you know,
it's it's just one of those pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's obnoxious as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to run these by since
we're winding down on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are these were in the same bag with
the Cali mist and the bubble gum and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually was able recently to send a
bunch of these back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old Spice of Life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some old legend seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, my my last attack of the Johnny
Blaze that people were mentioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally got to get those back in the
hands of Red, who made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Red might be making some new
versions of the old legend seed stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people that were interested in those,
you might actually come back to fruition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legends was a good was a good company for
a while there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a bunch of good shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Red spreads the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that guy a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do some quick questions or we
can do questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any that you saw that you want to pick up
on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're going to call me out and make
me remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If people are listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask questions right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a dying question that you have
to ask?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak on the highlights?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's plant like?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it compare to the NL five?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do that real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also sent Red back some legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimate Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also got the legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimate Indica for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian lights is oddly enough,
it's more Afghani even than the NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to be more broadly for an
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw some bubble looking types in it
that were bubble smelling, but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: just the typical bubble structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some color in these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of tropical turps, lots of pineapple,
just all through the tropical range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of what the best way
to describe that is, but it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropical tropical, basically tropical
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is essentially what Hawaiian
lights comes out like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very variant, but they all are pretty much
broadleaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Hawaiian lights in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have Caleb come on and talk more
about it soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be dropping the hybrids,
I believe this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been packaging a bunch, trying to get
through all the packages and orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those are done, then I'll add in the
Hawaiian lights hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep your eyes posted on righttico.com
and humboldtcsi.com for both.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of questions out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some stuff on leather turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: The A5 and some of the some of the rare
haze turps definitely have some leather in
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal and leather.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually kind of prefer that dark
profile to like the super bright fruity
[SPEAKER_05]: turpentine type of thing on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's there's haze lines
available all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: The trouble is just pulling out what you
want out of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's leather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leather is also a motor rebels harawana.
[SPEAKER_01]: His version of Steve Tuck's harawana,
which is very different is very there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of leather in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else just said it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's there's you know, there's some
American seed companies that I won't that
[SPEAKER_05]: are, you know, they're crossing things to
Cuban black and other haze things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's obviously some European seed
companies like Shanti Baba that have some
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big debate on what he's lost and
what he's had.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, you can definitely get it
seems like the mango haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is still really good from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's smaller breeders doing
smaller work on hazes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely is easier to get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if easier to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, there's there's good haze
cuts out there that are starting to slip
[SPEAKER_05]: out a little bit more wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, people were talking about
when did the first cookie pop out?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole show in itself,
but probably by like, oh, nine ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would say I can't talk about
somebody mentioned the legitimacy of Scott
[SPEAKER_05]: from Rare Danks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neville's haze couldn't tell you just no
idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Neville's haze has been for sale
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you use Neville's haze from Neville,
couldn't tell you what era was from.
[SPEAKER_05]: No information on that as far as that
goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you know, there's big debates.
[SPEAKER_05]: People talk about newer, newer releases of
shanty stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: People always get that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I wonder if it doesn't have that
or just you found it in one or two packs
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you go through five or six more
packs looking for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just not see it that time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the luck of the draw not pop up?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because it's a it's a it's a
super bitch to find one that you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Purple Haze was a super famous haze from
the original.
[SPEAKER_05]: Haze lines from America, you know,
they said they kind of bred it out on
[SPEAKER_05]: accident.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually magenta haze on the
poster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you know, so the problem with
haze is that it's hard to find keepers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a bunch of interest in it all
of a sudden in the last two or three
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's gotten some American
breeders collecting cuts and making
[SPEAKER_05]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Johnny come lately, motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just just be prepared to hunt
through some jungle weed and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and don't don't let you know, we should
mention we should mention that if we're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about jungle weed, there is a
super famous cut of NL five haze a I think
[SPEAKER_05]: in Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's called Dr. Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's called Quays, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quays, Dr. Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to say most people probably
know it is less than one of the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, Quays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Call it Quays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point I was trying to make is when
you watch this thing grow, it's a million
[SPEAKER_05]: little calyxes like this fucking big.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the kind of thing where 99
percent of growers would cut that shit
[SPEAKER_05]: halfway through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It produces a million little one hitter
type bong rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the weed off, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're growing haze, don't go by
looks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait until you can smoke it and see what
the effect is and see what the taste is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some of the shittiest looking weed
imaginable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm talking ugly like like like haze
is not IG photogenic.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there is a lot of ugly haze,
brown, shitty fucking growth, hairy
[SPEAKER_05]: looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you smoke it and it tears your
head off and it tastes delicious and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're happy and giggling and life is
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you really have to make sure don't
don't give up early, because that's what
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've never.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blamed out the ways they didn't keep
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what's this shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did pollinate it, but I was like,
Nick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, Neville even talked
about like his favorite female.
[SPEAKER_05]: He blooms it out and it took 20 weeks and
he thought it was the hairiest,
[SPEAKER_05]: ugliest, never finishing piece of shit
ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he cut it down and he hung it in a
corner and he killed the mom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a month later, he made some hash
out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it was some of the best weed he'd
ever smoked in his life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he still regretted losing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But by looks, it was the ugliest piece of
shit he'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so you can't judge haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Haze is not cookie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Haze is not photogenic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you're going for with haze is taste
and effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's going to be a gnarly,
big, ugly plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could get some pretty ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it looks hideous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a few people I've seen make
pure haze look photogenic and very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very few.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on top of that, what's going to
happen more often than not is that ugly
[SPEAKER_05]: piece of shit that you held onto that you
had dreams for that was going to be it,
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's just an ugly piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because that happened to me
quite a bit, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like I buy all this
Neville's haze and it takes me fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: forever to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like 14, 18, whatever weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm like, oh, I don't want to
keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say like, I never really rocked
rare date with stuff just because the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: was a dick to me.
But.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do like the moonshine
haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smoke it once at one of the
Denver Cannabis Cups at some mad ball or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember who was playing,
but it was some punk rock show and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to lie, even as biased as I am,
it was pretty good for a fucking haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Rich did a good job on the
moonshine.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you limit your seeds to only people you
think you like, you're really limiting
[SPEAKER_05]: your seeds in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sometimes weirdos and assholes
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they pop out fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't even know, dude, so I'm not
even dissing him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that, you know,
that that it's tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what makes haze tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's cool that people are trying to
make like more accessible hazes and that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's kind of gaining in popularity again,
especially from some of these smaller seed
[SPEAKER_05]: companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people trying to pump it in New York
because that'll keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need periodic booms of interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: To keep things going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you really said when I was
selling Pith, nobody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's very in demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I would have sat on those seeds,
froze them, you know, till now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not how shit works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was I was joking about Rare Skunk One,
the other show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, 15 years ago, you couldn't give
skunk away.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, couldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of the companies put free
skunk one or skunk haze or skunk,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever hybrids.
[SPEAKER_05]: One hybrids out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they just had so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just had so many stock and they never
sold any.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might as well make people happy and
throw in four seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now people are like, well, maybe there's
some secret sauce in this old skunk one
[SPEAKER_05]: that I can find the secret skunky smells,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have a lot better luck hunting for
something secret and haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you would in Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't want you.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have probably pushed it to its
limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, there's still surprises and people
ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should just remember because it popped
into my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: People asked about the bandaid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, seven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's a cut that floats around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that people I respect like Yo
Sammy in Europe and others have told me
[SPEAKER_05]: they view that cut as equal.
[SPEAKER_05]: To the old cuts that they hold.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the first haze in a long time that
they feel is as good and stands right
[SPEAKER_05]: there with those old 25 30 year old
strains that have been kept forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a lot more accessible to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, in America than a lot of
these other ones that I talk about,
[SPEAKER_05]: these things are I should mention people
think I'm connected or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been fucking hunting all of these
European haze cuts since the night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it it was like the white
rabbit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like multi decades of looking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's still some like that Neville
Pays cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that thing so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if it's in America, I don't know
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but anyway, the bandaid haze
seven is an amazing cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're growing it over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easier to get in America than the
rest of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it does take forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so be prepared to go 14 weeks or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a it's a fire cut by all
accounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that's Cuban black haze
cross to a five tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever Cuban black is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's possible that, you know,
it's that it's a C five cut by an eighth
[SPEAKER_05]: five cut by a tie male to bird eye pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But whatever case may be, there's a cut
that you can still buy bandaid hay seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's various versions of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's at least this one cut that
came out elite status.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people that have been running a
lot of these hazes for 30 years,
[SPEAKER_05]: if they think it's as good as the rest of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's pretty high praise from
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adopt is doing a lot of work that he's
good to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, yeah, we did talk about Tom
Hill just in brief.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not very not for very long.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but Tom Hill did release did
have Tom Hill Hayes and did have Tom Hay
[SPEAKER_05]: Tom Hill Hayes by Deep Chunk and maybe
some other more work around that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe all of his stuff descends
from positronics haze lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuzzle Brown is kind of saying that you're
wrong about a five and C five not
[SPEAKER_01]: existing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he's confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they definitely exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm saying is that there's there's
various haze cuts that I know are alive in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe and I don't know if they're alive
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a five and C five that have
popped up in America and there's a number
[SPEAKER_05]: of people that have them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still politics around releasing
seed around it or trading it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're still tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them, I should to be said,
some of them have some of them have the
[SPEAKER_05]: virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't run the SSC hazes someone's
asking about, but you should mention
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a good thing to mention,
because one of the things that's
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting is almost all the haze that's
available is based off of Neville's work,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a couple of males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or some posse work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Neville's seems to be the stuff that
everybody found fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we interviewed Correll,
Correll had a they had a and it's been
[SPEAKER_05]: confirmed by friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a 35 plus year old skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That he made from haze seeds given to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's interesting about if you were
to get Correll's work and cross it to some
[SPEAKER_05]: of Neville's work is that it's not
Neville's males.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another genetic of haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not quite the same bottleneck
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because haze doesn't like being
crossed to itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and it's from that same batch of seed
that Neville got, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't really realize that until we
talked to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a mind blower.
[SPEAKER_05]: But his SSC hybrids off that skunk haze
should be a completely different haze
[SPEAKER_05]: that's been available up until recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the same seeds from the same era,
I am going to be really excited with some
[SPEAKER_01]: new outdoor space to finally run some of
my haze collection and other ships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't finally get to pop the SSC stuff,
because I really wanted to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, there's I don't know,
I could I could try to, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: at the end of it, I could try to name,
you know, there's there's dog shit and the
[SPEAKER_05]: call.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't talked about the Colorado
cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, didn't talk about the cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cough is another thing we did in all
five haze episode, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's there's there's cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's dog shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dutch treat a sweet skunk from Canada has
a bunch of NL five haze in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, at least in its original form.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a bunch of American cuts that
float around.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's eight or 10 Dutch cuts that float
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what that all adds up to.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's great is that it seems like
from from a line that was available in the
[SPEAKER_05]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's the stew, which is one that
I don't actually somebody mentioned that I
[SPEAKER_05]: know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know of the stew.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stew is an old is another old NL five
haze from the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never actually grown it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been one of those rumors.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I hear about.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I've heard stories of the stew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked to people that I trust that
have talked about the stew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen the stew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it kind of like is it kind of like
disco stew in The Simpsons where like the
[SPEAKER_01]: deep rubbed off his jacket?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the stud in the stew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost want to say people might get me
wrong, but it's like it's the stew might
[SPEAKER_05]: be from Jersey or close somewhere in that
New York region.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, and it's old.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I but I don't know anything about it,
but it is it is another supposed NL five
[SPEAKER_05]: haze cut that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And an island sweet skunk is a little
different than sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mark Emory did this thing,
you know, that confused the lineage of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as we can tell, there is a real
there is a real sweet skunk that was
[SPEAKER_05]: basically mostly NL five haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it got did did did Steve cross it to
like grapefruit or something or.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know what it was crossed
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, anyway, the, you know,
fork, you know, so it's it's cool in the
[SPEAKER_05]: sense that there's a bunch of different
phenos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that have survived.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all females, obviously,
we don't have any.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't you know, people are asking me,
where could you get real NL five haze male
[SPEAKER_05]: pollen?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that might be lost to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have one of our buddies,
Kim Blackburn, is is a part of the cough
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have people closer to the cough that
know the history of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll probably bring him on at some
point working man to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a cough fanatic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's got he knows he knows the story
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's some there's some still
confusion about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was cough one and there was cough
two in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I used to smoke the cough in the
90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had I had really good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up with it and ended up moving out
to Boulder in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I used to go out there all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where I smoked that sandalwood
tasting AK 47.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those other famous 90s
Colorado strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the cough exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: The New York stuff exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberry cough is much different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the origins of strawberry
cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I know what Cushman says.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it is exactly like her beer
and it's turps and has a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: similar traits to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like some strawberry filled haze or
whatever that's worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cough, you know, the cough
basically like got famous in Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it came from Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to misspeak, but our buddy
working man knows like the people involved
[SPEAKER_05]: and like the people that brought it to
Colorado from there and all that different
[SPEAKER_05]: types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it definitely is, you know,
yeah, you never know the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dog shit I really wish still had its
original name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Its original name is right up there with
Western winds is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dog shit in Minneapolis was called
electric boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it sucks is like I was doing the
labels for the the dog shit cross to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I just wanted to put
electric boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know most people won't even
associate that with the dog shit cut and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll just sit there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it'll just sit there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But but electric boogaloo is one of the
all time great names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was asking about the primary pop
belong to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, the coffee is super well
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have we still have good friends
that grow the cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we talk to all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So luckily, the cough is alive and well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's there's haze in Florida
that got shipped to New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a cruise of Cubans down
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's crews of Cubans and Dominicans in
New York that run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, he's having cabin
fever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was what I was just talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fucking Mad Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had nothing to do with that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a cut out of Blue Sky Cafe
originally, and it was made by Lion
[SPEAKER_01]: Something Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still find the info on ICMAG way
back when he made it long before Mad
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer came to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an aft gooey crust deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not strawberry cough deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just relabeled by Blue Sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, one of the things I should say
about one of the things that draws people
[SPEAKER_05]: to haze is that we live in an Indica
dominated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the exact opposite of the 70s
and 80s where, excuse me, where Sativa
[SPEAKER_05]: ruled the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we live in an Indica and Indica
dominant scene.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And haze is a tie back to that ancient,
you know, no longer available import.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like it gives people a better
high in a different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a different high profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hits people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if people are extremely used to
and experienced with smoking chems or,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, OGs or whatever, you can smoke
some haze and have it hit you like a
[SPEAKER_05]: brick.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though it's ugly and takes a long
time and has these various issues,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's popular for my favorite reason for
weed to be popular because it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so that's the best reason to
like weed, weed that works, weed that
[SPEAKER_05]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm going to read 103 minutes,
so I think we are good for this session.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are good for the session.
