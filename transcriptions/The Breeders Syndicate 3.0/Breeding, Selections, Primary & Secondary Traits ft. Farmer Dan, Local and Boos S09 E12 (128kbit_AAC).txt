[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_04]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_04]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_04]: seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_04]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Syndicate is a collection of seed makers
that want to push back against all the
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_04]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Thousandfold, and tonight I'll be
your host because unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt isn't feeling very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got the youths here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Bring Back Farmer Dan from the
last episode, which was quite the hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't checked out the episode
Farmer Dan, I highly recommend checking it
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Matty Booze back and we've got
Loco back as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight we're going to be talking
about selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're returning to some of the breeding
theory that we started on last season.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, also want to recommend checking
those out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we did four or five episodes on
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've made a little playlist on the
channel so you guys can go check that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put it in the description as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so we thought we would.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually Booze idea to do one
focused, more focused on the selection
[SPEAKER_05]: part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for me, what's interesting is that
you can't really talk about selection
[SPEAKER_05]: without talking about everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll probably go over some of the same
concepts, but from the point of view of
[SPEAKER_05]: selection, which I think will make it a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, hopefully, even though it's
somewhat theoretical, we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: lean on the experience and knowledge of
some of these guys and maybe get some
[SPEAKER_05]: anecdotes or examples as we go on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I think without further ado,
we can jump straight into what are you
[SPEAKER_05]: selecting for?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I guess here we're thinking about
like breeding goals.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're thinking about like trait selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And perhaps another way of thinking about
this is like, this is maybe when you are
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking about the genetic material you
might have at hand and where you might be
[SPEAKER_05]: taking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if Farmer Dan could start us off
because I'm kind of curious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, we're kind of fresh from
his episode and I kind of want to know
[SPEAKER_05]: like maybe from his work experience,
you know, what is that very initial point
[SPEAKER_05]: of trying to decide like where a project
should go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with a lot of people's work that
it's honestly more like just an
[SPEAKER_00]: exploration originally where they're just
like, I like these two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be fire if they go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of just more of a mashup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like that can still be real breeding
if you're like actually do identify some
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that you really like out of there
and start selecting for that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so especially when there's like not a
lot of new avenues to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I usually start with something that
I like in a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like a popular one right now is
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to like really deep dive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why like really get in and see like
what's up with this plant's resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and like microscope it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to wash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to see how it's breaking off,
you know, and just like really hone in on
[SPEAKER_00]: that one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's kind of like how I
start is that like I just like find
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I'm really interested in
and then I want to learn everything about
[SPEAKER_00]: it before I even start trying to work it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that's quite an
interesting distinction as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like whether you have enough information
to even know what you are wanting or
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it might seem to some people like,
oh, like why are you just growing these
[SPEAKER_05]: out without knowing what you want?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, how do you know what you
want without growing them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and if you think about it,
a lot of people buy seeds because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have access to the clone that they
want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can't get skittles,
you buy a skittles hybrid, but you still
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't experienced skittles yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you kind of have to grow these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that's your only experience from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you do find something you like,
you know, and so like, you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone's like blessed to have this
like wide stable plants to work with and
[SPEAKER_00]: like work with them long enough to have
like gained experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some people have to start
from just the first seed packs they buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like that's kind of like
more common than guys like us that have
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, access to big libraries
and stuff if we want it or need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, local and booze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think in terms of like
determining goals and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: determining what you're looking for or
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the selection sort of paramount to
the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea I had for this one was not so
much selection as, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting a particular plant, but the
whole process throughout, like when you
[SPEAKER_01]: even select a packet of seeds to begin
with, like Dan said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: going with a cultivar you're familiar with
or perhaps looking to delve into a line
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not familiar with and find
something else out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it really starts right at the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like right now, for instance,
I'm not staying in the spot I'm at for
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be here for a couple of
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for selecting for my outdoor this year,
I went with shorter flowering things than
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually would.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't really plan a breeding
project or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to stick with a couple of
things that I'm interested in taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: look at that won't fill up a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm selecting, it's pretty much
always based on one primary trait,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's interesting having Dan and
having local on because it's preference,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a personal preference when
it comes to effect as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of other selection
criteria that comes into it that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: like secondary criteria, I like to call
them, you know, anything from bouquet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nose flavor, you know, longevity of
the high stuff like that, how it breeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going like deeper into it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the primary thing people
select for should should always be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything else lines up with that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're you're making like a large
selection from a large pool, and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: found like a number of cultivars that have
the effect that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can start to look into the
secondary characteristics and those
[SPEAKER_01]: alleles, you know, and see how many line
up on the same plant and go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's interesting to hear how
other selects too, because like Dan in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, you know, coming at it,
working in cultivation facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, working in such large pools
where you're potentially culling and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, I'd love to hear sort of more
about that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, we're gonna get into some of
like the differences when you get to like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, different scales and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before we get into dive into some of
those, like, yeah, I want to hear from
[SPEAKER_05]: local as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like initial thoughts when I say
like, you know, determining breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: goals, trait selection, you know,
what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, like me, for example,
like, I sometimes I do pop things with
[SPEAKER_02]: intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times it's kind of right
recently, it's been just to kind of learn
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, once you kind of have an idea,
you know, like you kind of have a
[SPEAKER_02]: direction on where you want to take it
based off of what you saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, I have like a sweet
pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really like narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it a lot, but I don't want
narcotics feed all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, since I know that, I think like,
you know, an approach to kind of mitigate
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be crossing it to a narrow leaf
type plant, something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't I don't really pop
things with like, intentions to cross just
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do like having keepers, obviously,
from a pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you brought up a good point as
well, which is, you know, sometimes you're
[SPEAKER_05]: just trying to counterpoint certain things
with with other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like set up like, you know,
interesting, like juxtapositions between
[SPEAKER_05]: like two quite differently expressing
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, really interesting to hear you all
about, like that thing about intention and
[SPEAKER_05]: information, because you can't really,
I think it's quite common sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really have intent without
information, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't it doesn't really make
sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of us kind of touched on the
fact that it's just like there is like an
[SPEAKER_00]: exploration period for most people when
they're like growing something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we can we can now turn to
like some of the stuff that Booz is
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in, like, you know,
some of the initial conditions,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, of the genetic material you're
working with, as well as like your own
[SPEAKER_05]: scale constraints, I guess you could say,
like, you know, infrastructure and
[SPEAKER_05]: resource constraints.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, here's where we talk about like
the difference in like maybe doing a an
[SPEAKER_05]: exploration or a hunt on on like a
commercial scale like Dan, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the smaller scales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Booz, did you want to say anything
again about that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, just touching back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just touching back on the goals and
stuff quickly, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even what Dan and I were talking about
before the show, it's kind of relevant to
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like local and I were talking about some
of the sativas and stuff that we've got at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment or smoking with and Dan's like
not as into sativas, but it came to like
[SPEAKER_01]: look into some Mexican stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your goal should be relevant to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you've been exposed to something,
you like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to breed that because,
you know, it's the thing that you're into.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I think gets a
little bit overlooked and muddy these
[SPEAKER_01]: days, where a lot of people are just
breeding for maybe these secondary traits
[SPEAKER_01]: that are less important, like Instagram
sort of specific traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's another thing that,
yeah, I think it'd be cool to get into.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in terms of society, do you want us
to talk about like primary and secondary
[SPEAKER_05]: traits?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you're suggesting or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just saying that like in this
day and age, so like back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, back in the day when there was like
less pressure to breed for Instagram and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that, and you're just breeding
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was less need to talk about this
kind of stuff because everyone was just
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for primary traits, just the
things that they like, which was the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this day and age, there's less
people that are working in that line and
[SPEAKER_01]: more towards these secondary traits,
like the way things look or color and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like when you get into larger
populations and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're finding a lot of cultivars
that have got this effect that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just want to hear how it's like
how people would go about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, how are you going to
select a specific plant when they're so
[SPEAKER_01]: similar?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you going to have to look to a
lab and stuff like that and use numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'm just interested to hear how
some of the other fellows see these
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary traits and how they'd select.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if they've got a line, for instance,
like local with his electric boogaloo
[SPEAKER_01]: across the Appalachia that he's popped,
he's got a number of ones that he's like
[SPEAKER_01]: really into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does he go to whittling that down
to just one or two plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew a handful of those, more female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were some that looked like Appi
and kind of smelled like it more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: like some of those kind of like,
I don't want it like tart fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't like grown the Appi pure,
but I've seen some of like Bodhi's hybrids
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's like a common note that is
totally Appi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of those had that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there were some that had like dog
shit smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only smoked the dog shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't grown it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I liked about a lot of these,
not a lot of them, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe four out of the number that I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like really nice like sativa
spears.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of a sucker for that,
if I'm being honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's kind of why I'm like looking
at the sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the high is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, that like that structure,
I mean, you can make something productive
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I kind of kept four of those
that had that structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm kind of just doing a lot of
the tests, smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them have like a leathery kind
of savory thing going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's this one that has like a
mango gummy bear smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like kind of pretty transparent
to taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effects are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of like, don't know where to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do I just like go, if they all have
the same effect, do I just go for taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of thinking so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think that's kind of the next step
in calling the next there the handful that
[SPEAKER_02]: I have at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's like, the way I think about
it, too, is like when you're working at
[SPEAKER_00]: home, you have this like great opportunity
to like throw all those secondary traits
[SPEAKER_00]: out the window and just look at high
because you're you're really ideally just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for something that you like to
work with and that you like the effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like when you start scaling up to
like going into a commercial scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, then something's got to be like a
five out of five in every category,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's not really like marketable in the
way that it kind of like has to be to like
[SPEAKER_00]: sell well nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that whole secondary drive,
like that they have to make a profit off
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're making and what they're
selecting through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like secondary becomes like they
all become primary, really, because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: to smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to taste good and translate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be like pretty and it has to get
you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just like it honestly limits the
number of plants that you can even find
[SPEAKER_00]: that meet the criteria by like a few
factors of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I think we're at like a
tenth of a percent of everything that we
[SPEAKER_00]: pop even has a chance to go commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's the numbers go way up and then
you start seeing tons of multiples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start seeing maybe you don't find what
you're looking for at all in that first
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to kind of make the call
of like, oh, well, do we try and like F to
[SPEAKER_00]: it or BX it or like keep moving it forward
to see if it's there or do you drop it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and because there's there's a
financial cost to all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no matter what scale but it's
really significant at a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can even kind of get into the
point where like the process itself is its
[SPEAKER_00]: own selection pressure because it has to
vibe within your like speed and pacing of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to vibe with like your soil and
cultivation environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that's one of the things that
I've been noticing a lot is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: process itself ends up becoming a
selection pressure that weeds out a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: really good plants that never even get a
chance to be seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That at higher numbers, you just you're
just increasingly splitting hairs,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, you even need more
information or otherwise you have to rely
[SPEAKER_05]: on like either like arbitrariness or like
or like your gut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do things like compare testing
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, does it really like represent
what people prefer in reality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like from what I've seen, usually not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you start getting into this
world of like, well, how do you like
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify a subjective experience in a way
that we can like run numbers on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really like it's a pretty
interesting challenge in itself of like
[SPEAKER_00]: running those types of surveys and then
like trying to run stats on it and like
[SPEAKER_00]: get anything useful from it besides like,
oh, well, these people liked it and these
[SPEAKER_00]: people didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really hard to get answers
out of people about that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're breeding for yourself,
I feel like it's really easy because you
[SPEAKER_00]: have that freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, when you're breeding for the
masses, it's like, well, what's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest number of people going to enjoy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like a weird,
interesting perspective that I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'll say this as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this conversation is quite a
difficult one because it will feel quite
[SPEAKER_05]: circular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you in kind of like we've already
kind of articulated how you can have to
[SPEAKER_05]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we like you have to move forward
to like move back to move like forward
[SPEAKER_05]: again, sometimes to get like, you know,
different kinds of information.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we kind of also jumped
straight into like literally the
[SPEAKER_05]: evaluation decision making part.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some other things I wanted
us to talk to first as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like so I had this whole section that I
thought we could talk about, which I call
[SPEAKER_05]: like initial conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is stuff like what numbers are you
working with?
[SPEAKER_05]: What generation, you know, what filial
generations are you working with?
[SPEAKER_05]: How stable already, you know, how narrow
is the is the pool that you're working
[SPEAKER_05]: with?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've already determined,
you know, what your your target,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, primary secondary traits are,
you know, how much do you know about the
[SPEAKER_05]: likelihood of those traits being passed?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this kind of I guess this kind of
information partly arises from an
[SPEAKER_05]: exploration already.
[SPEAKER_05]: But partly, it's also about like the
numbers you're working with and like,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, like I said, like the filial
generation and like what you know of like
[SPEAKER_05]: the boundedness, I guess, of the of the
genetic pool already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do any of you have like reflections on
like what some of those things how some of
[SPEAKER_05]: those things would affect the project
overall, like how you start out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they like if you go, yeah,
a little case study sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to that, I guess,
trait based selection, we've got a cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: a friend of mine found Eli, local bird
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to it's souring cross to
Kentucky bluegrass from PIP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still violet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he found it in I think out of two
packets or one packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the run to your phenos super
low yielding compared to the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the smoke is just yeah, it's unlike
the others in the pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super dank, always lays me out,
cuts through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got an amazing nose on it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was an outlaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to speak from that pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we're going through the
stages of how to work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's done some hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done a couple of interesting ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He crossed it to Southern charm from Goat
and Monkey, which is like a Irene TK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So already there, he's going back to a
grandparent of sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the in the from the souring on the
mother side of the still violet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one way where he's tried to just
enhance that effect to go back to an
[SPEAKER_01]: initial parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a back cross of sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so working that forward, we're trying
to think, well, how are we going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to put that into a seed form?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we get that particular pheno to
pop out when it itself already was an
[SPEAKER_01]: outlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking about, like, selfing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to S1 it and then listening to
what people like Kamira and Caleb have
[SPEAKER_01]: said about locking in traits by selfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take it to an S2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then an S2 as a seed line can be
something that's generally hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: germinate or this that and the other or
you can just present itself a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems like even popping S1s like I had
this idea about when you get S1s,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to pop them and it's going to
be like an exact replica of the parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I see all these S1s off it,
I'm like, OK, that's just you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to try that clone, I'll buy that
S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in growing a few packets out and
seeing like all these weird like run to
[SPEAKER_01]: like inbred expressions that come out of
it, I'm like, oh, OK, so maybe like a
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized hybrid is the way to go to find
like a better expression of that initial
[SPEAKER_01]: parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's just like, like you said,
a little circular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, what path do we take?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there seems to be like multiple
ways to skin this cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm trying to like lock in this one
trait and select just for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it itself was an outlier,
like, you know, there's a few paths to go
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've listed like, you know,
crossing it to itself a couple of times or
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially hybridizing it and searching
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I'm interested
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have gotten the experience of
having like a particular trait that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not super prevalent in the line,
like say like that Sherry AK or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and how you would go about
potentially breeding towards that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I think an easy one is like the
Z Terps, because it seems to be just like
[SPEAKER_00]: this one off in the gene pool,
because like when you S1 it, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: find things that are like exactly like Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be close.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be similar, but they're not dead
ringers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you this is like the part in the
process where I feel like you have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little your hands dirty to like you
do your pedigree analysis to the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: your ability and kind of like look at what
the parents are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about those parents,
like what do you see about like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny of like what you're working like a
hybrid of them, you know, to just like
[SPEAKER_00]: identify like what you think might be
coming from where, but then like you
[SPEAKER_00]: really have to like to see how some things
like past or to see how stable or inbred
[SPEAKER_00]: or narrow it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to like roll up your
sleeves and start, you know, growing out
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like on the Z, it seems to me that
that aroma profile that's like really
[SPEAKER_00]: pungent is a fairly recessive trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you out-cross it to something
that it's not closely related to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't see it pop up very often at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see kind of like it's dwarfism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like resin traits of being like sandy
and kind of oil-less, but you don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: those, those Terp profiles show up very
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've kind of noticed is like I
had to like reevaluate the process that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like maybe using that parent itself
doesn't pass that trait the way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what if I take two of its children
that like they may not even have the
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, but they have a nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cross them together,
you get this double up of that recessive,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that took like a lot of,
and that works for me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I found a few nice plants that were
kind of exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was almost random at a certain
point because like, yeah, I had an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: the project, but I had to like grow all
the plants out and I found two out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a couple dozen that were
exactly what I wanted, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really have to just like start
making the crosses and growing the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: out to see like how something's inherited.
[SPEAKER_05]: Local, any reflections on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I could add at the particular
moment there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything to say about, how do I put it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like we have covered,
okay, Dan, maybe what's your take on like
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms of starting points, like does it
change your approach to know that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: working with an S1 versus like an
outcross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you can kind of like feel
that there's no outside influence of
[SPEAKER_00]: another variety, you know, like I look at
S1's as like a peek into what the
[SPEAKER_00]: parentage might be, especially on these
like clone only types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like when I like on the same
like example, like a ZTURP thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like my next avenue of exploration
is like, well, do the S1's pass it better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the original clone did, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've yet to see like a real world
example of that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other S1's I've grown, you know,
like you can definitely see what gets
[SPEAKER_00]: locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the things that are like more
elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you can start kind of like
playing with that in your mind and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: unraveling the mystery in the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike filial generation, I had a thought
on that as well, because I've had projects
[SPEAKER_00]: where like I had a really nice mom and a
reversal that, you know, passed the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the traits were kind of lost
in that F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all kind of blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually took getting to that F2
generation to kind of like segregate
[SPEAKER_00]: traits a little better and get the
expressions that were more interesting in
[SPEAKER_00]: a wider variety of them where that that F1
hybrid was kind of the honestly one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: closer things to an F1 I've seen where
like all the plants were like identical
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, you know, just like a slight
nuance difference in aroma between between
[SPEAKER_00]: each other, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the F2 generation,
you got this wide segregation of all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was so much more fun to play with
and look through than that F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like, I'm not trying to make
like a true F1 hybrid where they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not growing fields of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want really interesting and novel
combinations of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so filial generation can play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's worth going forward
because, you know, you're actually going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get new combinations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that does articulate one of
the big tensions within every project
[SPEAKER_05]: where it's are you looking for outliers or
are you looking for stabilization or
[SPEAKER_05]: homogenization?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that is that like a fair paraphrase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I don't really want like
homogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's like that's a really
common goal of plant breeding because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like when you're growing indoors and
it's a clone that you want identical to be
[SPEAKER_00]: packaged so the consumer can have the same
experience every time that they go and buy
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which is like a standard across all
commercial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you know, like you don't want a
different experience every time you go
[SPEAKER_00]: open a can of Coke, you know, but weeds
kind of more on that, like wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like more like sensory pleasing
type of product that like everyone kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: has a different preference and a different
like it's just like beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people want their cheap
beer, their Mexican beer, their craft
[SPEAKER_00]: brews, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's got to be something for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I don't really breed for
anything but diversity now, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like I want to find new combinations of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a seed line that's like all
keepers, because it's so much easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: fix the secondary traits than the high,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what you I always find in a
really stable line is like kind of boring
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is I'm interested in booze reflections on
this, because I think that's an
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting take, which is that like can
you say it again?
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondary traits are easier to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like it's easier to fix the
structure, the look, the you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not that hard to make most of
the plants look the same, but to get all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them to be like a great high or a
higher prevalence of them, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like breeding is a stats game,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're looking to like increase the
probability that something's found in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like if it's one to 20 in the
original, you doing your selections maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: brings that up to one and four or one and
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like as far as like a stabilization
project goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like fixing high seems to be like
really elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whose thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like why the whole thing's such a
head fuck for me, because you get
[SPEAKER_01]: something like, all right, you get an
elite and you times it to an elite and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're likely to you know, I mean,
you starting the good stock on both sides
[SPEAKER_01]: to progeny, you know, kind of expect what
you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you get something, you know,
you hear about like the breeding of haze
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that and how they had to
work through, you know, so many
[SPEAKER_01]: generations and so many different lines
and like made so many wrong steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just tricky to get my head around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess, like you said, there's no
like one way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, like you just don't want to
forget something in a line like even what
[SPEAKER_01]: local said about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all right, I want I saw a few
expressions come through that were like
[SPEAKER_01]: spear like and they really had the high
that I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I select for that way, like,
you know, through link traits and that
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what am I leaving behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think realistically, I'm like,
I'm looking for a model that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: applied to to a lot of different
selections, like whether I'm working with
[SPEAKER_01]: some sativas and some hazes and stuff like
that, whether I'm like looking through
[SPEAKER_01]: some some indicators or some, you know,
I mean, some some more broadly stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I know that I'm going to be like,
how what's like a target model for
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's a target model for not leaving
these traits behind?
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a I had a kind of tangential
question, maybe off this, which is we've
[SPEAKER_05]: talked about effect being, you know,
a primary trait that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we we can somewhat agree on, partly
because it's elusive, but partly also
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's desirable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about something like smell flavor?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that those two are often sometimes
even like pitched as though they were in
[SPEAKER_05]: tension.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like sometimes, you know, you can find
something that has great smell and flavor,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it doesn't have the potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So often you hear about that tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess that's like with the
skittles and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Dan was talking about, it's not like
purported to be exceptionally potent,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's still, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super famous line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like what Caleb's doing with the
reversals and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing one of his selections,
like making S2s, looking for that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, yeah, even with the bubblegum
and that, everyone says it's not the most
[SPEAKER_01]: potent line, but, you know, it's got an
amazing nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess these are considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like on a larger scale, Dan,
like when you were doing some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for other facilities and stuff
like that, was that one of their major
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know you said in your interview
that you had selections that you might
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have kept, but they never would
have seen the light of day because they
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't what met the the quota or the
square there or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it like they were going for the
stinkier sort of ones or the ones that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a bit better aesthetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sometimes there's stuff that's like
really tasty and like really, or has a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice high, but it's like horribly
ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just like not going to be
saleable or marketable because like you
[SPEAKER_00]: could never take a nice picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a lot of times those will go into
like either like future breeding projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like most of the time they end up in
the bin, you know, because it's like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was almost good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of unfortunate in that
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a lot of people that breed
like almost exclusively for flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: because like potency itself is also
subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people only like to get so
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that from a lot of older folks,
like when I've been in dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and there's some senior citizen with
their veteran hat on and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, the last stuff you gave us was like
way too, way too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we need something lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's like a whole portion of the
demographic or a whole demographic of the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer pool that like kind of wants
light weed, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they maybe first tried it or
whatever, it was probably only 10 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: THC or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually do like tasty weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it usually is lower potency,
in my opinion, as far as like fruity and
[SPEAKER_00]: candy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's desirable in its own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I like to have them around and like
do blends with more potent weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a nice OG or a chem or a hybrid of
that, you know, and then put some really
[SPEAKER_00]: tasty weed on top and get some of that
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it all has its place,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to ask you as well, Dan,
like and this is probably what I consider
[SPEAKER_05]: like a naive question.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you mentioned before that you thought
fixing effects was harder than fixing some
[SPEAKER_05]: of the other like maybe more structural
traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you say the same of smell and
flavor?
[SPEAKER_05]: That that that can be hard to fix as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can be pretty elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stuff breeds really dominant for it,
you know, and you can see that and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes life really easy because it's just
like every time you have like a population
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with, like for me,
right, it has to be the five out of five
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time one of those is fixed,
it just makes my pool of selection
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly easier to pick through,
because then you can go based off of
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and the other four, you know,
like it makes it easy by eliminating one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, because they're like,
oh, they're all really pretty or they all
[SPEAKER_00]: taste really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that doesn't have to be a pressure
at that point, you know, and you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking more and diving into the other
things without that convoluting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there was part of that I
didn't answer, but we're all stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I think that was, you know,
I think we got we got the point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also, of course, like no
definitive way we can say that,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, that's always going to be true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just talking about like what from
what someone like Dan has seen in his
[SPEAKER_05]: experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, anything else in terms of like
some of these, I'm calling them initial
[SPEAKER_05]: considerations, but it seems silly to call
them that now, because like we discussed,
[SPEAKER_05]: like you already have had to have done
quite a bit of work to even know about
[SPEAKER_05]: some of these questions or answers,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone have any other reflections?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if not, we can move on to quite an
interesting thing, which I think people
[SPEAKER_05]: don't get to talk about that much in this
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything from you local, me or anyone
else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I've got something,
but I think it leads into the second bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we can we can just we can move on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, again, like this talk,
honestly, like while I've set out these
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of like progression of points,
like honestly, we're just going to keep
[SPEAKER_05]: looking back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing I wanted to talk about
characteristics and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've been shitting on them a bit,
but relevant to note taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's super important because you
can't smoke it till the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't know really how the effect is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having all those secondary
characteristics to lead into your note
[SPEAKER_01]: taking and reading notes and stuff like
that is super important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was that is the section.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this section is about like I think,
again, especially from Dan, it must be
[SPEAKER_05]: very different from like anyone doing
breeding or seed making at home,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's about organization and like how
you you organize your information,
[SPEAKER_05]: your data collection, all of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe this time we start with like
booze or local, like on a smaller scale,
[SPEAKER_05]: like how do you get ready to embark on
this kind of project?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what do you prepare in terms of like
your notes or documentation?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you take notes local?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do you have like a little notebook
that you're writing down all your
[SPEAKER_01]: observations on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just take pictures or what's your
call?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of pictures, but I also like,
you know, I have like a note on my iPhone
[SPEAKER_02]: that I kind of keep like track of the
smells more or less because.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, you can't really smoke
it, like you said, so this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Information is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's relevant, but it's not relevant until
like you you've done the final analysis of
[SPEAKER_02]: all the data, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I like to look back on it
after, like I generally keep two separate
[SPEAKER_01]: sets of notes, like the ones I'm holding
now, like handwritten.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like, well, pretty much like
from week two or three of flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: I start doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really care about in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things will just do what they'll do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, I'll just group them like
before I flower them out, I'll just group
[SPEAKER_01]: shit from highest or from like tallest to
shortest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that might not be realistic
of what they're going to perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like growing a bunch of stuff
from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it that way and then I'll start
taking notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, week two or three flower pretty much
once they start putting putting out a
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be like writing down, you know,
aroma on the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm seeing any resin and stuff like
that, even the way like the flow,
[SPEAKER_01]: floral structure is if it's like tall or
short or how similar they are to one
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then depending on how many things I'm
running, I'll start grouping them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I'm running, I don't know,
14 different phenos from a line and I see
[SPEAKER_01]: that, okay, three of them presenting this
like, you know, sort of more rounded top,
[SPEAKER_01]: more like a mothbally sort of nose,
whereas these other ones are more like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, spears, taller, a bit more
gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll like group them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I'm actually trying
everything out after drying it and
[SPEAKER_01]: assessing again, I'll go in those
categories and assess that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like when I'm whittling down,
you know, 14 phenos down to four,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'll have my four different
categories and, you know, select the best
[SPEAKER_01]: one from each of those categories and then
go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I like to do mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to just do it all in my head and I
still do like for the greenhouse where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just growing like one packet of seeds,
but where I'm working indoors and I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, multiple packs of things
on the go and I'm trying to like keep on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it super handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I'm culling, I'll generally
just go through, you know, and just assess
[SPEAKER_01]: and group characteristics and then,
yeah, cut back from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd have to say like my like home
process is like really similar to that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just keep a lab notebook like I did
in college and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I set off a section, leave a few pages
and just take notes on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and height and, you know,
estimated flower time when I cut it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was responding well to like just the
base speed that I was giving everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it needed something extra or like
needed more water on average, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: really base cultivation notes so that when
I come back and if I find something I like
[SPEAKER_00]: and I come back and regrow it,
that I'm not like starting from square one
[SPEAKER_00]: again with like, you know, what I think
they're probably going to prefer and like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets a lot more hectic at a
commercial scale because I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it on the server with
someone in the DMs and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's chaos at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I have like 40 spreadsheets and
they've got everything from like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm a little tedious with my notes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially at work because like I'm taking
notes all the way through flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like brief ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they're really just like what
stands out the most when I'm like going
[SPEAKER_00]: through a big room of like seedlings and,
you know, they're already flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like I'll take a few small
notes, but it's really at the end where we
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting a little more intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I'll look at like its height,
its general stature, like it has big,
[SPEAKER_00]: strong stems or it's thin and lanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at like its leaf to bud ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has like lots and lots of big fan
leaves coming out of the buds or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more like an OG and they kind of just are
little skirt at the bottom kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'll look at a lot of resin
traits, like whether it's sticky or sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at, you know, general aroma
profiles, trichome density as far as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it like, you know, coated or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I have a lot of like
qualitative scales that I use for that
[SPEAKER_00]: where it'll be, you know, like high resin
density versus medium or low kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, little sub ones in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the real note taking happens
after it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's where I start getting
like a lot more meticulous about like
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma notes and effect notes and what I
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a part of me that wishes I had
that much more time and money because I
[SPEAKER_05]: would totally build something for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting to do a community one,
honestly, where it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like send out a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, all right, you can grow it
your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, these are the traits and
like the things that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would take some big effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it'd be really cool,
like crowdsourced big data pools like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, where you're like have a thousand
seeds popped of something, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking mostly just about managing
the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could, you know, I can easily
envision like a tool with like a proper
[SPEAKER_05]: database with, you know, proper querying
and reporting and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I was talking about with
Quasia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been using spreadsheets.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a few, there's like a company
called like Breedbase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of them, honestly,
that are like kind of plug and play
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no like Kana specific ones as
far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there actually might be a market for
that, you know, because it is kind of its
[SPEAKER_00]: own different process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the needs may differ vastly from
like a normal crop that's in the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: for quite a while or, you know,
only gets turned over once a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's clear like how critical
documentation and like proper archival is
[SPEAKER_05]: for this process, especially on like a
certain scale, because like Booze was
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, there's just no way you can hold
that stuff in your head past a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even as a home grower, like I had some
plants that I forgot to take notes on
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was like during that whole
surgery thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at them dry and I'm
like, I can't remember anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to forget.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so even if there's also not long
before like your current run just blurs
[SPEAKER_05]: into like previous ones as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone else got any other points on like
organization or like documentation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing like those massive pops,
like 600 seeds or whatever, are you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: culling in veg or like early bloom,
like based on some of these traits?
[SPEAKER_01]: If like, you're not seeing enough resin
density or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will call stuff that's like not
thriving in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it misses like, you know,
cause we have to like clone everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a backup copy and then send it off to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if something like say doesn't clone
easily, it'll probably get taken out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something isn't thriving in the
environment, it probably gets taken out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it herms, it definitely gets taken out,
like zero tolerance on that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you end up like removing probably
about 40 to 50% of the plants based on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these traits on certain runs
because they're just more prevalent in
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to have the numbers to be able to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I keep shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my buddy will pop like S1s or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, Oh, anyone that comes up
looking mutant or trifolia or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just fuck them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sitting there thinking like,
man, my friend found, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this one of the best plants I've ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it was this runty little
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, you know, if I'm throwing
away all these little ones, I'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what, what am I leaving behind
potentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll keep them and I'll just baby them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even if I keep them in the veg a
little bit longer and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: flower them out longer than the others,
I'll hang onto them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always wonder like in large
facilities, you know, you'd be stupid when
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got like investors and stuff as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't spend time fucking
around with like, you know, seedlings that
[SPEAKER_01]: just won't veg, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a cost to it though, you know,
cause it's like a lot of people say those
[SPEAKER_00]: runs are the best smoke a lot of the time,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the things I wonder
when people talk about like that the highs
[SPEAKER_00]: are disappearing on, on modern weed now is
just like, if it's really the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: election presser, that's like removing
those runs before they even have a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to be evaluated as flower kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's something funny to me
about this because it's like the,
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like CSI is one of those people
who's famous for saying that he likes
[SPEAKER_05]: growing out those runs, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who I was referencing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause once you've lost them, you can't
even go back and know whether you've made
[SPEAKER_05]: the right decision or not, I guess,
unless you like keep them all the way
[SPEAKER_05]: until the end still.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, just to like prove to yourself
that you've made the right call,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's so much work in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, at that scale, it almost
necessitates being really ruthless because
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean like Skittles, I think is a
dwarfy little mutant that probably would
[SPEAKER_00]: get cold in any facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG KB is probably a little dwarf mutant
that nobody would select for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think OG even to a certain degree falls
into that category because it's real
[SPEAKER_00]: finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd probably get cold nowadays just
because nobody wants to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, you know, it doesn't fit
the model that's going around these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting point, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because am I right in thinking that by any
idealization of like structure and yield
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything, a lot of hype strains
wouldn't necessarily like be ideal fits,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So fashion in the market also clearly
playing a huge role in, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's an obvious thing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that actually kind of links back
to what we were talking about earlier with
[SPEAKER_00]: the like fixing secondary traits is like,
one of the reasons that's so easy is
[SPEAKER_00]: because in the modern gene pool,
it's all coming from such a narrowed down
[SPEAKER_00]: point that it's already fixed for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't have to select for purple OG
structured low leaf to bud ratio plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like honestly what's fixed in
the gene pool more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like a new baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a, it's just, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passes it cause it's so fixed,
but you know, that's why that kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: I was inferring earlier on by like,
Oh, it's easy to fix secondary traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy if it's like, you know,
a rarity in a gene pool, but like in our
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool that most people work in it's a,
it's, it's all fixed for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I meant by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a academic type of academic young
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like at university and the things
that you've learned about selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, going all the way back to
like, um, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: So do with the fucking peas name again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, going back to that, do you find
any of that applicable to the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: that you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, leaning on academic shit
for that or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in a way, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, there's just so many genes at play
that it doesn't really apply, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there still is like, um,
you can kind of achieve an F one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you properly select the
parents, um, but I haven't gotten that far
[SPEAKER_02]: to like, we have two true, true breeding
parents, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of just looking for good weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and like, yeah, breeding can fix
traits to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like at the end of it, like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, good weed is good weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I was interested to ask you,
cause everyone will have a seat on by this
[SPEAKER_01]: chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know fuck all about breeding and
genetics and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was interested to see someone that
actually is like, learn this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find that any of the academic
literature is relevant to, to breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at home, but I find the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, go brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we actually like basically had a whole
bunch of the whole episode on like the
[SPEAKER_05]: science and what we felt the limits were
in application.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably worth like rehashing a
little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A local just did touch on it slightly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Mendel's model of heritability does
depend on like certain conditions,
[SPEAKER_05]: ideal conditions being in place,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you actually knowing which alleles
map to which like traits, uh, which,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, like whether it's like a proper F one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leading to, sorry, proper like ideal
parents leading to a proper F one,
[SPEAKER_05]: which leads to a proper F two generation,
which often we don't really get,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you like in, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we mentioned a whole bunch of
other things as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they are these other strange things
where, what is it like one trait can be
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled by multiple genes, um,
or, or one gene being linked to multiple
[SPEAKER_05]: traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that possible as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like both of those are possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and like people, the, the scale is
kind of what people fail to like realize
[SPEAKER_00]: is that like I was doing some,
um, reading on some gene correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: studies with reversals and it's like
12,000 different genes that are activated
[SPEAKER_00]: during the reversal process that aren't
active during flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of those, um, has like on
average 12 different alleles or versions
[SPEAKER_00]: of that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, um, there it's, it's like
incomprehensibly complex, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: local, did you have to do like taxonomy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and like I plant ID when you were in
college.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that those kinds of classes were
actually like kind of done being offered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of the botanical professors
were like kind of on their way out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always retiring and like,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And taxonomy, it's like, I don't want to
say it's a dying field, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not really relevant anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, except for grasses, grasses are the
only thing I would have loved to do
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it, it, mine was kind of more like,
um, ecological models and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was, I was actually just having a
conversation the other day about how like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't learn anything about breeding
beyond Mendel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I learned, I took a bunch of genetics
and evolution courses and like ecology
[SPEAKER_00]: courses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, the only thing that I feel like
really helps me in like my breeding is
[SPEAKER_00]: like really was the tax, the taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant ID and like developmental
anatomy, because you get, um, you get like
[SPEAKER_00]: really used to identifying really,
really minute traits that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes not visible to the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, um, that's like, what's
determining where you go next on the
[SPEAKER_00]: dichotomous key of like what you're
looking at, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like that's like really,
a really good like training course for,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, trade identification because you're
just honed in onto all these micro
[SPEAKER_00]: features.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting that you bring that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, uh, one of my professors,
she did a lot of like, um, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like pedigree type of analysis where
she'd grow a lot of like, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, uh, crosses that she would make from,
you know, different populations or cross
[SPEAKER_02]: within populations and kind of see what
genes were coming from what specific
[SPEAKER_02]: population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it, it like, when you,
do stuff like that, you kind of do learn
[SPEAKER_02]: to pick up like those really minute traits
that might not like be an end all be all
[SPEAKER_02]: answer, but like, you're like,
okay, I know this characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this will breed can breed for
this, you know, type of deal deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if anything, it was more like,
um, learning models.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is, it's nice to know,
um, but it's not essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a whole piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not a tool in the toolbox per
se, but just like a mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mendel got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always forget about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was looking at like the perfect
plant breeding model possible of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like real simple dominant recessive genes
and like a plant that's like an obligate
[SPEAKER_00]: in-crosser unless you like open up the
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there was luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he, it was intentional,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he chose, I don't know, but yeah,
yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I haven't read it referenced
that way, but, um, well, I think that's
[SPEAKER_05]: always what's interesting about any
application of science.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talked about this on your episode
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like the construction of the model
and then testing the model is like one
[SPEAKER_05]: thing, but checking the models fit to
reality is not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's, that's definitely the kind
of question I would love to ask someone
[SPEAKER_05]: like Chimera if, you know, if and when we
get him on, because it's even attention
[SPEAKER_05]: for me in producing an episode with him
where I'm like, I'm sure you could tell us
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot, but it's like how much of it is
just out of theoretical interest for most
[SPEAKER_05]: of us versus like stuff with like
practical implications.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, people at home, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really cool theoretical
and like, like technically achievable
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that yeah, that just doesn't have
any real application to like further
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but it is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've designed a bunch of experiments
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like absolutely worthless,
probably wouldn't work, but they're like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool theoretical concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean like this is a little detour here
perhaps, but like, from your experience
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding and selecting on those commercial
scales, like have there been lessons
[SPEAKER_05]: you've been able to take home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene pool is way more narrow than most
people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like what I always like is just
like smashing me in the face is cause like
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a new marketed name and you grow
it out and you look at it and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's just this slightly reworked or
reflavored, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's actually hard to get diversity
outside of the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that because of like the particular
playing field that you're in?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but it's kind of like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hammered on this show a million
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that the gene pool is kind of,
you know, like in trouble as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that it was legalized made it to
where, you know, like the nursery's on a
[SPEAKER_00]: mom up something that's going to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they pick 12 or 15 things that they
think will sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sells right now is like candy,
gas, purple, OG structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like there's economic forces,
like selecting the gene pool right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very short.
[SPEAKER_05]: This narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, yeah, it's nothing that hasn't
been said on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a parrot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like that is those are the
conditions that we are facing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's hard to ignore them when,
yeah, like you said, like smacking you in
[SPEAKER_00]: the face every day, but then like whenever
I've been doing a new state that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized, cause like we always tried to
be there first is you get a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that kind of just crop up from all
these people that are just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I've got this in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like a regional diet of
weed, but there's no provenance to any of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, Oh, did I really have
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it just this weird one-off thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I saw some stuff like that
in Oklahoma, like this dude like showed me
[SPEAKER_00]: some weed and it was all lime green.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I call it Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of had this like, I don't
know, it had a soda-y sweet smell to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but never heard of it,
never seen it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like there is pockets of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, we need good caretakers
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so the next section I had in mind is
kind of looping back again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it's, it's, I called it
evaluation and decision-making and I
[SPEAKER_05]: suppose like this is, this is kind of
after you've gotten all your information,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: All your data sets are there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've flowered and I presume like
harvested and tested everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're at the point now where you're
having to make those choices of like what
[SPEAKER_05]: to keep and what not to keep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've sort of been talking about
this the whole time, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, this is selection already.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you want to like
talk about again while we're here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that's come up for people since
we started talking about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like it's all that, that this is
the part where like, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoy having your notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I'm smoking something,
I like to look, I like to read my
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation notes while I'm smoking
something and writing down the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: notes, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm actually more curious about
like the criteria other than like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that's fire that Matt and local are
both like, how are you thinking about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I'll always have like a few
decisions where like, obviously there's
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that was like the strongest and
there's usually the one that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: tastiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there anything that ever like
sticks out to you guys that you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, I don't, I don't know why,
but I have to keep this for this reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like for me, for example,
things that like to like grow themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially is a really nice trait for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why, but I'm kind of just
like, at this point, a little convinced
[SPEAKER_02]: that things that you grow better are
ultimately going to express better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like when I'm selecting something
that grows a lot better for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm ultimately going to get
the more true to expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like my weed doesn't ever get
me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get, you know, it all works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like, for example,
like the EB appy stuff, I thought a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the highs were all there, but it's just
like, it comes down to like, what is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow the best for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I want to keep around the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it becomes hard because like,
you know, you have that whole FOMO thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, when you get rid of
something, you're almost like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: second guessing yourself because you're
not sure what was lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't know what you can't get
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, how long do you keep it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, how many, how many cuts do
I want to keep?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, like if you've got a
line and you've got like four sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively different expressions and
you're a fan of all of them, like you just
[SPEAKER_01]: hang on to everything or you like
recombining those phenos in an attempt to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Create something that's even better in
combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where do you go from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like, I tend to hang on to stuff
probably longer than I should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll have like two or three things
and I'm just still whittling it down and
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that stage, I'll start asking
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, all right, which one did you
like out of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I really can't, can't get to a
logical conclusion myself about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, sort of also it's like,
where do you go from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is this the epitome of this line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this like where I want to start with
this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to try and maybe get another
packet of seeds and see if I can find
[SPEAKER_01]: something better than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's the FOMO thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess it's a little bit of imposter
syndrome even like looping back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: start with exposure, like you and me
thousands and even local to an extent,
[SPEAKER_01]: not being in California, but like you and
me, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't been exposed to a lot of these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have, I've been to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried, you know, a couple of pieces
and hazes and stuff over there and other
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, like, you know,
I haven't smoked the real Saudis or I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't smoked like NOG, any of these
baselines really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and I'm keeping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, obviously I'm keeping it
for myself, but you know, I like to think
[SPEAKER_01]: of like, and I was myself as a bit of a
seed saver too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got a large collection and I
want to, you know, keep it around not just
[SPEAKER_01]: for myself, but for others as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm thinking about like,
you know, selecting something or hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: onto something, I'm like, fuck,
is this even worth it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I might like it,
but you know, is it worth like just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting rid of this so I can focus my
attention on popping more packs of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: to find something even better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I guess not having that exposure to
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you sort of set your own
baselines and then yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, definitely man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I, it's funny when, when Dan was
talking about, in a way, I guess how jaded
[SPEAKER_05]: he was with the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to also, I had a moment of being
like, you know, I'm so far from that,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I just haven't seen, haven't seen
any of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so even like right now I'm running
blazer pandas born in the purple,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a T 1000 from CSI humble and
underdog Urkel also from CSI, but Panda
[SPEAKER_05]: selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's my first encounter with like an
Urkel OG combination and Urkel like full
[SPEAKER_05]: stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that it is nice, but I also can
kind of see through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see in it, I guess, like we're,
people have taken that since, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if we want to consider Urkel and OG
probably being like a component of some of
[SPEAKER_05]: what's happening back, like way upstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is fascinating to kind of get these
like snapshots of where things have been
[SPEAKER_05]: and gone, or like where things have come
from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to this, I was also doing like,
you know, TKS ones, 91 S1, Chem D hybrids,
[SPEAKER_05]: just to kind of like, yeah, start working
my way through some of those names.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a very different experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like you said, as well, you know,
in a way it is a bit of a gift too,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we're not as constrained,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: By either like the market or taste or like
fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No Mylar's over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, plenty of Mylar's dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an easy one to bring over,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the easy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably closer where the Mylar's
are getting made than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably flies fewer miles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, I think the T 1000 is probably
like, it's probably one of the places I
[SPEAKER_00]: would tell people to go if they were
looking for like better or like healthier
[SPEAKER_00]: or just like reinvigorated versions that
would still hit that modern appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it is the base of like everything
that we look at in some convoluted way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just, but just imagine if that's
all you ever saw at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I'm like, I can see how nice
this is, but I'm like, I can also see
[SPEAKER_05]: myself getting quite tired of this as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it, it's fixed, you know,
it's truly fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I dunno, I'm just kind of
tired of smelling those creamy anise
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a place in my heart for
some sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, past that, I kind of think
that's where it peaked honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly tangential, but, um, brings up
interesting point that spindle made
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday in the discord about like
potentially making a new clone only,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so like 90% of the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I won't go that far, but aside from
cookies and stuff like that, but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the shit that was kept around seems
to be like from the nineties, early two
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands with like all the hazes and
diesels and cushions and chems and like
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the shit that was kept around in
clone form, train wreck, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how would you even go about making a
new clone only in this day and age with
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a million marketing channels and
stuff like that to have to wade through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like, uh, I can't remember
who I was talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was local, but, um, I was just
like looking at like the modern gene pool
[SPEAKER_00]: and that bottleneck and I drew a bullshit
little diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, OG perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, like just like the
base, you know, like thin mint sherbet
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato, everything we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the way to make something new
is like more like what some of the homies
[SPEAKER_00]: on the server are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like, I really like when I see
things like, um, last episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about pack and the, um,
Santa Cruz wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a really cool, it's two clone
only is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're like, the real magic is
bound to happen is that like, that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: uncommon cross that I haven't really seen
made before this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also get high and lonesome
and he grabs it and he takes that and
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses it to the Appy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like neither of those are really like,
they have maybe some elements in some
[SPEAKER_00]: modern things, but it's so outside the
fold of the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we see now because it's like an
upside down triangle is how I view the
[SPEAKER_00]: modern gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of just like fold in some
things from down below every now and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it still comes down to a point where
it was like one or two cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, um, being completely outside
that gene pool and like going back to
[SPEAKER_00]: pedigree analysis, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like you can look up enough of this
stuff to make sure and just be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, like this seems like an uncommon idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm outside the primary gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like what people need to start
doing and start adding some new trees to
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest instead of a new branch to the
family tree kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say that some of those Santa Cruz
wrecks, man, look pretty fucking saw like
[SPEAKER_00]: on par with like modern blue dreams,
resin coated, man, when you grow it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, I can totally believe it and
she gets dark or at least the Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_02]: rec, some of them got pretty fucking dark,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that the blue dream throws
purple with led like a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have talked about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot more of that Anthocyanin
production for some reason with led over
[SPEAKER_00]: sun grown or, you know, HPS, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I wanted to, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want to signpost one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're kind of like leaving behind
selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's probably good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we just opened it up and just
like, we can all just talk about like what
[SPEAKER_05]: we're into in terms of like projects that
hypothetical or real projects and stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to prod local a little bit
because, you know, he, he now has like,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't know how much, I don't want to
pressure him to like talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't want to, but I feel like now
he's kind of got a really interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: library and a really interesting kind of
like pool of genetics to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm curious to know like, you know,
what he's going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Loco, do you want to speak to any thing
about like what you, you thinking of maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: playing with in the future?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be vague if you want or as
detailed as you want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, right now, like I don't have
particularly anything in the works,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've been, um, working on reversing
the sweet pea, um, cause I'm, I'm super
[SPEAKER_02]: set on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think it has really great smoke
quality and I think that I can use that to
[SPEAKER_02]: my advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell us about the lineage again,
just for the people who don't know what
[SPEAKER_05]: that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sweet pea, um, so it, uh,
comes from, uh, to, um, P 91 S ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, two different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bitter, um, bittersweet SD made,
um, he made that like two and a half,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe three years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I've grown about 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then there were two that I really
liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and now I have the one that I have,
but it, I've, I've had it like for going
[SPEAKER_05]: on three years now, I want to say,
um, what kind of plant is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What, how does it hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that, that's, that's the hard
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's kind of like, uh,
soapy in a way bright, um, at least my,
[SPEAKER_02]: my specific sweet pea cut because,
uh, not, not all the P 91 stuff would
[SPEAKER_02]: smell like this, um, at least based off of
the sweet pea that I saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there's kind of like, uh,
a nice soapy, um, bright note,
[SPEAKER_02]: some slight, uh, nutty kind of notes to
it, like a savory kind of nuttiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there were some that had like,
uh, a leathery note to them, but with
[SPEAKER_02]: that, like kind of bright, I don't want to
say like, um, eucalyptus, but more like
[SPEAKER_02]: camphor or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, totally, but it's, it's really hard to
describe the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not like it, I can't really put
words to it other than like in my cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: instance, like that bright and soapy
smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about, so you've obviously thought
about what could compliment it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, or like, or pose like a
counterpoint to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your ideas or possible ideas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, so I guess we could take this
to kind of like the primary and secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know for a fact that it's pretty
damn strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and now what I'm looking to do is,
uh, kind of either reduce the potency or
[SPEAKER_02]: like kind of, um, use it to like carry
taste better, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like something like the death star,
I w I would love to pull that off,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, it's not looking too successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it would have been nice to kind of
see what the sweet coffee would have done
[SPEAKER_02]: with the death star in terms of kind of
being able to carry that now, like that
[SPEAKER_02]: rank taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause I don't know, we like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it does taste good, but sometimes I
don't think it carries the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's hard to, to put to words,
but kind of that super skunk stuff doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: always taste the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I was going to actually ask you for
just everyone, like rounding out the
[SPEAKER_05]: historical context, like the P 91 itself,
like, you know, what, what is the vibe of
[SPEAKER_05]: the P 91?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's the thing is we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, it throws, I don't want to say
it throws a lot, but it throws enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: say that it's a poly hybrid of some sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at least in my opinion, cause like,
you know, the, the crowd, the sweet peas,
[SPEAKER_02]: like two S ones, so relative, like you
would in, in theory, it would be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, relatively stable, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was like in regards to the
potencies and smells, but like there was
[SPEAKER_02]: varying structures and you know,
that to me kind of points that there might
[SPEAKER_02]: be a little more behind it than,
you know, some, some may would think,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for telling us about P 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, uh, I also wanted to ask,
ask you about some of the NLD stuff that
[SPEAKER_05]: you have also, because I think then booze
could also speak to some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I also want to hear from booze
about what his plans are with some of
[SPEAKER_05]: those, but like what, yeah, do you want to
tell us about some of your NLD stuff that
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got and what you might want to do
or what you might be trying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, like I've mentioned earlier,
I'm kind of a sucker for those Hayes
[SPEAKER_02]: spears.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the Band-Aid Hayes, number seven,
the EB Appy number 16 that I have the EB
[SPEAKER_02]: Appy number 14 also does something similar
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the one thing, the one,
I guess the one complaint, it's not even a
[SPEAKER_02]: complaint cause it's kind of like a shitty
complaint is like the way that the buds
[SPEAKER_02]: form on the sweet pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I wish the buds were a little more
elongated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it would be nice to like,
you know, take that structure from a Hayes
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of implement it into sweet pea
and, you know, kind of, kind of see what
[SPEAKER_02]: comes out of something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or like cross something like,
uh, a Hayes or narrow leaf type plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: like, um, let's see, like a Snow S1 or
something like that, or, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: something of that nature kind of play with
the idea of like doing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: narrow broad to see if you get,
you know, kind of heterosis, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause ultimately, um, like if you're
asking like me for like my breeding goals,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to want to create like a good
amount of diversity so that I like the
[SPEAKER_02]: room is, is paramount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have like the possibilities are
endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what I, I would like to do
for myself, like in terms of hunting,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it doesn't get boring, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be harder to find things,
but that's like the beauty of it is being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to go through plants, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah, I have, uh, so I have the death
star in the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the band-aid Hayes number seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, and I have the Santa Cruz rec number
six, uh, which was one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some seeds are forming, but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's nothing too crazy, but at least
we know that the pollen does something,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many did you reverse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just one at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a bunch in veg, um,
you know, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, uh, there are other things that
I need to kind of prepare for in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future that, you know, a reversal right
now might not be like the best idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm shot for time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit as well, but fucking I've
already like flipped six and they were all
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, all right, we're all in,
but I've, um, I got a cool plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thread cutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, uh, the mom is I think similar to
something you've grown the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, it's similar to the glass onion
that you just did a thousand, but it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, star four was the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rubber city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem D Afghani and then G's along to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found one out of 18 that was,
uh, my favorite in terms of effect and
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was runty compared to the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It throws these big chunks on like little
stick frames.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not really like a cam or something that
I'd expect to see, but yeah, out of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, it kind of grew almost like a vine
to start off with compared to some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other like more robust indicators,
but throws like really good resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, it seems to like other shit
in the tent have been a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by mites this round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've had a drama just like with
inspections and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having to bring stuff outside and then
bring it back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've like got a couple of pest concerns
and they don't seem to really be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: any damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've, um, I've reversed some of them
because I've got a couple of sativa cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: in the arsenal from my mate, uh,
as well as a, I've got a star mox cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: that's from another buddy that that's like
stardog across to Malamo Harkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing with that is the,
the mox, which is the, uh, being reversed
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the stardog in this instance,
uh, it appears to be super dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: because even though it's been reversed
onto a bunch of indica, because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: still getting like, uh, 14 to 15 week
phenos popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, uh, I'm interested to see how
that will cross to this indica plant
[SPEAKER_01]: because the mox, uh, the star mox it's
thrown like pretty decent sized buds as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, but nothing like chunking out like
the thread cutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crossing this, uh, something that's on
like a bit of a lankier frame,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that's supporting large flowers,
like the thread cutter onto something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's on like, uh, you know, much more
sturdy frame and throwing like a more
[SPEAKER_01]: spear like, but I'm interested to see how
those two will go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, breeding sativists together or
something that I'm super interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I haven't really done a lot of it,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've just been in the popping seed
stage, but made of mine, local bird seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done a really interesting run
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's used like a TV mail from Bodhi and
crossed it onto the three cuttings that he
[SPEAKER_01]: has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Isaac Hayes, which is from Yosami,
that's that, um, a G 13 crossed to a C
[SPEAKER_01]: five F two of sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, he, what else he's got?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a bandaid Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Harlan dreams, which is like a
blue dream crossed to a PIFS one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by crossing them onto the TV,
it's interesting because you don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of people doing these sativa
hybrids, like a bit more than now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, obviously it's like AC and Bodhi
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you think like in the eighties,
a lot of the magic that, um, came over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam was like, you know, from the
Hayes and the skunk and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: which featured, you know, some pretty
crazy equatorial land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just interesting to, you know,
now that a lot of diversity is being sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of lost to an extent and a lot of people
are playing around just in a smaller gene
[SPEAKER_01]: pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be cool to see like what's being left
behind, so to speak, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: see what like a Colombian crossed to a
Angola red does, or even some of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the oldest stuff from Neville and crossing
that into, you know, some of this more,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, rural land race stuff and just see
what pops out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm super interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like granted, I don't think it's an
easy path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, I think it's pretty easy to,
you know, get a couple of packets of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: these days and make something that's
pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like breeding is, it's kind of been
simplified by the sheer amount of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are making seeds and working with
good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the eighties, when there was only
a couple of people doing it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was kind of a crap shoot, um,
so to speak, you know, cause you have just
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers alone, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're working with such less
numbers, but now that there's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so many people in America
working with clones and collectives,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I don't think it's that hard to find
good plants, uh, in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these cultivated varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to like land races and
earlier, you know, regional cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where it's, it's going to,
we're going to be able to find these,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, really unique cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that line as well, like with my
Yeager S1 that I've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a pretty unique old school
line as well, you know, fucking Herms,
[SPEAKER_01]: like something else you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a fantastic nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is like some Hindu Kush,
like from the eighties or nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, either from Neville or from,
um, someone else that had imported it or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, perhaps Logan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from Washington or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I think that could be cool
to inject into some of these Sativas as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, kind of like doing a F1
hybrid of sorts, kind of like Neville did
[SPEAKER_01]: with the NL5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's something that I really
want to do going forward too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, once I've busted into some of
these, you know, packets from white
[SPEAKER_01]: Buffalo and Wally duck and some of these
other cats, um, you know, find some cool
[SPEAKER_01]: Finos and put something like the Yeager
onto that or an Urkel or, um, purple
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one, one high level reflection
that I have listening to all of you is
[SPEAKER_05]: like, there've been kind of suggestions
from like different tactics for,
[SPEAKER_05]: or strategies perhaps for achieving
novelty or like achieving, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: something that is, you know, not subject
to the same, uh, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, constraints as like some of the more
hype stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether that's like going a little bit
further upstream to some of the like,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, older elites, like the blue dream and
train wreck going even further upstream
[SPEAKER_05]: to, you know, yeah, like booze is saying
land races, regional, cultivars,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, or just kind of being adjacent,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like going sideways perhaps a bit more as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and yeah, that's, you know,
that I, I find like thinking about it on
[SPEAKER_05]: that level, quite interesting too,
where you have this like huge possibility
[SPEAKER_05]: space and you can like, or graph maybe,
and you like, go up or down or you go
[SPEAKER_05]: sideways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I find that stuff really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's, uh, I think that
there's not a lot new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every now and then I see something
novel come out, but it'll be like
[SPEAKER_00]: something really small and not it's
because I'm searching so hard to find
[SPEAKER_00]: something interesting to look at,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I really, like, I agree with Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are going to have
to start taking some of these um,
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I honestly just the oldest cuts
you can find that are still good and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have that aren't, you know, like,
you know, roshaded glasses types cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, um, and we're going to have to,
you know, start crossing those out with
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that, um, aren't common
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like the only way we're going
to find, um, anything new and exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: that new elite cut, you know, like I have
no idea what it'll be, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely know when something's like,
when I look at something and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's kind of played out, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, um, I'm really, we were
talking about this before we started
[SPEAKER_00]: recording was like, I'm really interested
in old Mexican cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's kind of a pipe dream or
Mexican seeds is, uh, um, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be where a lot of the magic from
like the seed bank days and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with a lot of varieties, like that
Mexican seemed to be kind of a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: middle ground between really, really long
flowering and something that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: manageable in the Northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also has like those nuanced
flavors and highs and expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I'm sure that comes with a ton
of herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I've seen from Landry
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you try and work with it,
it's lots, lots of herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes back to Matt, just being like,
it's not an easy path, but I think it is
[SPEAKER_00]: the path that we're going to have to take
to find exciting things that aren't kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, um, just redundant and, you know,
kind of tropes at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other thoughts on like, possible
directions that could be taken from any of
[SPEAKER_05]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that someone recently told me
that there seems to be like a few types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like the white being one of them where
like, when you cross it with something,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the profiles and the plants seem to
be more than the sum of its parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there doesn't seem to be a lot of
examples of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we're like, like, you know,
what's funny about the white is it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of just like, I've really resin coated
odorless, aromalus OG type, you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, it seems to like make really
interesting aromas in its progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really know what that's from,
but I think it's something that people
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be looking out for more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is it a naive, uh, assumption for
me to be like, oh, it's obviously a
[SPEAKER_05]: recessive trait of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even just something that like there's
types of genes that need to be outcrossed
[SPEAKER_00]: to like express and, you know,
just because something's fixed in a gene
[SPEAKER_00]: pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like the homogenous combination may
be like not great, but then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's crossed out with something,
then it can express in the desirable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think people need to get away
from the idea that like a dominant trait
[SPEAKER_00]: or a fixed trait in a population is always
a good thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I have a, I have a bit of a,
uh, I don't know what you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This kind of question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I don't know if it's silly,
but I, another, another way for me to ask
[SPEAKER_05]: something like this is also like,
are there particular smell or flavor
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles that we haven't either come
across here or haven't been like
[SPEAKER_05]: popularized yet, uh, or that are more rare
than others that you guys are interested
[SPEAKER_05]: in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plant's honestly capable of
doing all of them from what I've seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I've been surprised by stuff,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like, I can't really think of
something that I don't think would be like
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, you know, because like what it
seems to me, like, is that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, just like cannabinoids, a lot of like
terpenes and aromatic compounds have like
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple versions of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's almost like the evolution of
the prevalence of like a compound and a
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's like, you can have different,
um, prevalence of different, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like isomers and types of like,
uh, um, like limonene or that's probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like super deep into scent
science, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it, um, yeah, like I think that we
can get all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, when you have a narrow
gene pool, you get one thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we can get that worldwide gene
pool opened up again, I've heard people
[SPEAKER_00]: describe all kinds of wild combinations
from, you know, trips up into Nepal and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that and Northern India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I've never experienced that
myself, you know, but like, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: spicy hashy fruity combos seem to be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, um, I think it's just going
to be more novel combinations of smells
[SPEAKER_00]: and aromas more than like anything you
haven't seen in weed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we've got everything from garbage to
artificial grape candy, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, who was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Loco was on this conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you were there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan, I was, I was asking, I was asking
them, um, about, uh, fruit smells and how
[SPEAKER_05]: often they translate and which ones tend
to, and which ones don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know grape is probably quite a good
one, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that it does tend to transfer from
smell to flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've seen it go both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it go both ways on the,
on the fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost seems to be like a
prevalence of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, like it's its own trait as
whether the, the flavor translates or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to determine like the
chemical form that that aroma compound is
[SPEAKER_00]: in and like whether it's like surviving
combustion or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like form that tastes good,
or if it's converted into a form that
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes good, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like a huge thing is there's
a lot of stuff that's fruity that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: taste fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that's very desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells like a peach, I want it to
taste like a peach or something else
[SPEAKER_00]: equally as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool when flavors like,
I don't know, maybe you smell strawberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you taste blueberry or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weird combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that could be really novel and really
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I was going to say like blueberry is
a good example.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't obviously we know because,
because we are associated with Matt,
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously we know quite a bit about it,
but I feel like for the purposes of the
[SPEAKER_05]: wider market, it's not that well
recognized perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of one of those common
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions though, that you get asked by
people that are, I mean, maybe just at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain tier in the industry, but they're
like, Oh, it smells like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it translate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's definitely something that comes
up in my conversations with work quite
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_05]: Local.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you were telling us about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, was it white gummy bear or,
uh, you know, smelling E.B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like does, how, how does that translate to
flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would say it translates pretty well,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know if it's cause like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like a really kind of wet,
oily resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that kind of allows it to like
carry really well, but it, it tastes just
[SPEAKER_02]: like it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously like, as you get
towards the end, it just turns into weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the taste is definitely noticeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I mean, I, I don't, it doesn't get
me any less high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than the other one, other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I guess, yeah, it's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, some of them don't taste as
amplified as that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the number fours has the same smell,
but it doesn't taste as like, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: volatile, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like it's not as like flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the number one, but the smells are the
same.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a follow up question for both of you
who are, uh, so Matt, Matt booze is like,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, may, may be unavailable for the rest
of this chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how he goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, um, for you too, Dan and
local, uh, I, I had a question cause when
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt riot was doing his, uh, smoke
reviews, he's doing flower reviews for a
[SPEAKER_05]: bit for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, what was interesting was
obviously watching him, uh, smoke it in a
[SPEAKER_05]: bong and then smoke it in a bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's you know, vape it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't think local vapes,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Local.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do you Dan and like, how do you,
how do you conceptualize that distinction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, it's just like a difference
in, in heat really, you know, cause like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when like the puffco's first
came around, they actually like,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get hot enough to combust your oil
fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always had this just like pool
of your last dab in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the new ones are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new ones like can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like I've noticed like a lot of
the vaporizers, um, they have this like
[SPEAKER_00]: pop corny flavor that comes with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I've never tried like the,
what does he have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the V rip or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what that thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it looks like he's free base and
cracked to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have like a pax three, I think a
little handheld dry flower vape,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I really like it, but it's definitely
not for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for like ease of use and like,
so I don't feel like I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, inhaling liters of
smoke into my lungs every day and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get cancer and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, they all, all the vapes that
I've ever tried all kind of like in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: change the flavor and make it slightly
worse because that pop corny flavor is
[SPEAKER_00]: still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, um, I wouldn't be skeptical to
say that like some people enjoy it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's more true for like the E
dab rigs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that you get like really, really
excellent flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can dial in that, um,
temperature of your banger just perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: to the 10th of a digit, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, local, any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole topic of different consumption
modes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I smoke primarily out of glass now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's literally all I smoke
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used to smoke joints only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've noticed is, um, it took me a
while to like acclimate myself to the
[SPEAKER_02]: taste of like flower through glass,
but like it does taste better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I don't have a vape personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the same like feelings about
vapes as Dan until I tried that rip that
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt has.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like all of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did make the weed taste like popcorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first hit was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then every, like everything else after
that was ass, but that for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it like, you actually get like a lot of
the nuances, like the, the death star
[SPEAKER_02]: tasted really fucking nice through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had a, um, AF GUI cross to Appy that
I tried through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, if I had like the setup for it,
I would totally get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what goes into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used it once and that's it,
but I don't know glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just feel like it's the most
average measure of like what the conceit,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what people are going to smoke it as,
or how they're going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like, it goes into like how
you smoke too, because like, I know older
[SPEAKER_00]: people that just pack enormous bowls and
they like want to pass it and like
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone just smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this charred ass bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, it's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've, I don't really like smoke in
groups very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people, I know smoke,
but they don't want to like sit around and
[SPEAKER_00]: blaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so like when I'm packing my bowls,
like I pack snaps and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely burn it, you know, like I don't
want the plant material to really burn up
[SPEAKER_00]: that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to burn all the resin heads
and then like unpack like a partially
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal and pack myself another fresh
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, yeah, if you, you're not going
to get that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're packing these massive bowls and,
and taking multiple hits off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's getting cooked each time,
you know, and so, um, how you smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with like just in the category of
like, like combusting weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's so many like different little
nuances that can like make or break your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and how much you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also, the comment, the one thing that I
did like about joints a lot is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you have, do you have some
development to the smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not the same thing from start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it has stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which a bong is like, I think it was
thousand that was saying it, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just like a one and done type of deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it has no, like, like it just peaks
and then goes absolutely straight down
[SPEAKER_02]: from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't smoke the downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, uh, see, I don't really like
joints and blunts that much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did when I was a more social
smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I always say like the best hit on
a joint is the dry hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you get great flavor for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that little tube of paper and some
ground up weed in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can like really, really taste,
you know, it's, it's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: experience than like just the,
the smell sensory side of it in a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jar, like, cause you're actually tasting
that and it's reacting on your tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I feel like that's actually
one of the best ways to like experience
[SPEAKER_00]: what something tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't usually like it once I start
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause those stages to me, they like mostly
go downhill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm open to be proven by like a
specific sample.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess though, one, one benefit is that
it does give you like some additional data
[SPEAKER_05]: points.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it may be like really trivial in
the end, but maybe that white ash,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's the white ash thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like, okay, maybe this type of
flower seems to progress better.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it doesn't go downhill as quite
as much as other ones, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I guess I'm just bringing it back to
like, you know, this, this is also another
[SPEAKER_05]: way of thinking about all the different
ways you can try to evaluate your flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: We obviously didn't talk about like how,
how well it extracts and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously that's like another,
another kind of like metric you could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes back to like the rosy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thing like rosin is just such a pain
in the ass trait to breed for,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not only growing the plants
and identifying the resin traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also all the post-harvest
evaluation side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not just like, Oh, is this dank?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, no, then I have to go through
a whole separate process of turning it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the best hash I can, you know,
and I'm not an expert hash maker at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, it sucks when I have to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I'm hoping I can pick up some
skills from some of the people on here and
[SPEAKER_00]: just get some practice, you know,
but, um, it is like its own whole beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, it's a, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't made heads or tails of it yet,
but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not as simple as taking one 5%
washer and crossing it to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you don't even know if they like
wash for the same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so evaluation can take like so many,
um, different, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can have so many faces to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but going back to the joint flavor and
stuff, like that's one thing I love about
[SPEAKER_00]: like Jack types and train wreck and stuff
is those flavors do last through a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: and like J1 to J1 is really nice for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's, it's really enjoyable when you
do get those, those experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpinoline bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit like lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially cause you can get like sweet
bubblegum turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's one of my favorite things
right now is that it's like, you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of different nuance on turpinoline
or like mango turpinoline, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I think that's another not
well explored avenue because people think
[SPEAKER_00]: teeling is just teeling and it's like,
no, I, I've, I disagree at this point now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's like the, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it's the everything turf, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than mercy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's divisive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've had arguments, friends about it
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be present in boring situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've had a couple of bags of stuff
that was just like, you know, not decent
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it pops up where you don't want
it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of OG hybrids and it utilized,
um, one of the parents on one side had
[SPEAKER_01]: like the cat piss in it, which is,
I think it's a San Diego cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a super silver haze cut of
sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like all throughout veg,
I'm getting this nice, like lime,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuely sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it all capped off,
pretty much all of them cured out to like
[SPEAKER_01]: a turpinoline sort of smells in that
instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, didn't like it, but man, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of the favorite smokes I've had,
like the Dutch haze in Amsterdam from
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shops, like the better haze I had
over there was like the teeling smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see too much of the a five kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, even over here,
man, like, yeah, some of the, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: preferred, uh, plants I've found have had
turpinoline in it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I'm, um, it's interesting with
flavor, like getting back to like vaping
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I missed that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking, I got like a nerve thing at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all, yeah, fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some weed, man, like seems to be the
stuff that's more hashy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I predominantly vape, but if you
get something that's got like that hashy
[SPEAKER_01]: or like the cushions tend to do it,
like that Jager cut even has it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to like cling to the power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, I don't know compared to other
stuff you taste it where it's just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, smoke or a cool smoke flavor,
or even like the more stringent shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some stuff I've had that super
citrusy, I don't like smoking it just at
[SPEAKER_01]: that temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does something to the mouth feel,
but in a vaporizer, it's all fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause I really like vaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've had a vape for, I don't know,
five or six years, like how the crafty
[SPEAKER_01]: from stores and Bickel, that one's these
for portable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got like one of those ball
vapes now, which are like the tabletop
[SPEAKER_01]: ones with the, um, little hammer and like
the rubies and shit that heat up and that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit's next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's similar to that V rip thing
that, that Matt has, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for in terms of like getting turps and
stuff out of it and, um, and effect as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That she rips does the job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, maybe this is encouraging me to go
back to using my vape a bit more because
[SPEAKER_05]: like, I, I go in and out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but I think especially when I've just
got some like freshly harvested flour,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's probably a really good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: To pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good to assess as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in both ways, I think, like you said
before, like smoking it and vaping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, when you really get down
to the nitty gritty of like sorting
[SPEAKER_01]: between like a couple of Phoenix and I see
how it works both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we did a little, um, Canada
competition, not even a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: competition, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a wank, but just a bunch of us,
like 10 of us in the other discord that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in, we did like a little,
you know, uh, trade and share sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with each sample of that, I'll try
one, you know, just smoking in the bong or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wanting the vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, man, I have to admit it'd be an
unpopular opinion, but every once in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while I will put a little bit of tobacco
into a joint as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not in the bong man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that animal, but I'm having like a
bit of red wine or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a nice meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a cool night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'll put a little bit of tobacco in,
but it's gotta be good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it tastes like shit and it's going
to like, you know, just be completely
[SPEAKER_01]: covered by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not into it, but, but yeah,
I was a fan of that American spirit
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I lived in fucking Europe,
man, for like a year and a bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, everyone over there smokes that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked American spirit when I was
traveling there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say actually like hash and
tobacco, man, that is a really interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sometimes you could really taste like
the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, I don't make like any sort
of like special, I just use a fucking trim
[SPEAKER_02]: trim screen and use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like even that mixed with tobacco dude
is super fucking nice tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, I don't smoke tobacco either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, me neither.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't smoke cigarettes or anything,
but yeah, no hash and tobacco is next
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in Amsterdam, the pre-rolled ones
that they'd sell at the coffee shops for
[SPEAKER_01]: shit house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it'd be like, you know, like the
tiniest little bliver hash and like two
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes, but yeah, rolling myself with
some decent hash, like decent hash making
[SPEAKER_01]: a snake in the middle of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it completely covers the flavor and
it's, I don't know, it's, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: unbridled, you know, you're not having to
mix it with, um, you know, a different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis variety, you know, cause it's not
like you've got like the stiffed off that
[SPEAKER_01]: same fucking plant unless you're growing
it yourself at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm just a degenerate, but I love
taking bong rips of those fifties,
[SPEAKER_00]: the moats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, what do you, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like half weed, half tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really do it much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard moats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard moats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard, um, I've heard a few other
ones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so I was called them fifties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't fucking know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a bunch of different names,
but it's all the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched the documentary and I think it
was Oregon or some shit and it was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned parents thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these kids like mixing their bowls,
like 50 50 in the woods and like passing
[SPEAKER_01]: out and shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not ready, you're going to nod
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to rip your head off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more like the fucking rule than the
exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's probably going out of it now,
but for the most part, most of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember doing that with like gravity
bongs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing like three liter poles and stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think it was like Bodhi said,
like in, um, like in his travels,
[SPEAKER_00]: like into the, like the Himalayan areas,
like, I don't know if that was Nepal or
[SPEAKER_00]: what, but like he said that like they,
um, they say that like, yeah, the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you high, but the tobacco keeps your
feet on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I always liked that, that little
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mellows that it mellows the,
the harshness or like, you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're just like floating away
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lost like intro, you know, introverted and
mute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're not used to it fucking
hell, like I want to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I did an exchange in Europe for like
12 months at school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was back and then my mates
come and visited me and I hadn't smoked
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco in like six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that first split.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fucking higher than I've been in
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it hits differently when you haven't
had it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but that's why I like to not do it
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just if I'm drinking for the most
part, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inhibitions go down and you're like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always found it to be mild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a mildly psychedelic for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't like, since I don't smoke
tobacco at all, dude, that nicotine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucks me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh dude, that rushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that bad for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, dude, it's ex it's excellent,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I almost compare it more to an
opiate for me though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like my personal experience,
cause like it feels like a very short
[SPEAKER_00]: lived, like opiate lethargy, you know,
just like gone on the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I will say that like, it actually does
bring me some joy that we got so far off
[SPEAKER_05]: track because typically I'm, I'm really
anal about these shows, but I've actually
[SPEAKER_05]: been waiting for a good opportunity to
like, just let, let, let people go off and
[SPEAKER_05]: just, we just talk about whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I think that like, we're coming to
the end of the two hours and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, booze, you did have a few other
questions about more like, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the mechanics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, or tactics when you're breeding
selecting, I don't know if you want to go
[SPEAKER_05]: into those or if we should just like wrap
it here, like call it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Oh, it's just more like the whole
thing, man has said it's fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: multifaceted and a very open discussion as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like selection in general, it's like the
whole thing with like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from selecting the pack of seeds to the
way you grow it to the light and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, you know, like it's pretty
open, but just like, yeah, in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess tail end of it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you've made this, sorry, there's one
last thing I'll say is that one thing I
[SPEAKER_05]: have definitely learned now, this is like
the fifth breeding episode I've done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard to say you're going to
talk about this, like one part of breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: without talking about all the other parts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think I'm like starting to
understand that like for some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: episodes, you know, the like outline is
probably only like, you know, useful to
[SPEAKER_05]: like a degree after which it's like,
you know, like you say, there's so many
[SPEAKER_05]: dimensions, so many parameters.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like variables that like, you just
ended up having to loop around,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just me like hiding up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all good, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep the ship steady.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Admin fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did, I mean, did you want to ask any of
those questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause some of them are interesting and I
would be kind of curious to know what
[SPEAKER_05]: these guys think.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe this is the way to round it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like once you've made the selections,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've, you've gone through a couple
packets of seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've come out with a few numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you going to run those from
clone a couple of times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's your consideration after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how many times basically do you want
to see that thing perform?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to try and dial it in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how quick are you to throw things
away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys generally keep like multiple
things from a run and run it again a few
[SPEAKER_01]: times just to narrow it down and make sure
you haven't like fucked up underwater,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way that this guy has,
has taught me, um, here one second,
[SPEAKER_00]: good night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, my son's going to bed, but,
um, breeding should almost always be about
[SPEAKER_00]: like, um, omissions more than selections
when you're at like a really large scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: because like, it's about like honing
things down slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, there's usually a few plants that
you can throw away because you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is, that is some garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect was kind of meh, you know,
it's weed, but, um, and so I kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That model of like, not so much making
selections as much as like figuring out
[SPEAKER_00]: what to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way it's not such a hard decision
because you're not wondering of what could
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually looking at what you can
see and like what's right in front of you
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of like, well, is it possible that
this could be in there kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like, I think you also said like,
how do you like do the numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to like narrow it slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, say I run, you know,
a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found three that I liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably go and fill my four by four
10 with a few clones of each of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's actually kind of nice to see,
um, if there's any slight variation or
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, I feel like it gives
you a better idea of what you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at from an individual when you've got like
four side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just like, for me, that helps me just
like delineate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you were mentioning earlier of
like grouping plants and categories,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that, that also is kind of
where I'm doing this, where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, like, I'll try and pick the best out
of each category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not like comparing, you know,
very subtle nuance more than just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I like this one for this
reason, this one for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like at the end, that's the hard
part where it's like, Oh, I'm comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: apples to oranges kind of, but they're all
from the same line and I can't hold all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough edge space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like you, I hold on to stuff way
longer than I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm trying to get better about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think by like breeding by omission
can be like a useful tool in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you Loco?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a cold heart, you just throw
things away or what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably got like 90 solo cups in his
place, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough because right now I'm kind of
in that quote unquote collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, stage like, I mean, like growing
seeds and find and keeping stuff from
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I don't know, like, I wish I had
kept something, for example, from the sure
[SPEAKER_02]: best one, but you know, I'm gonna have to
pop another pack, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: because like, there are just like,
so there's just a lot of shit that
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes I can't clone or not like
physically can't clone, but it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like, do I realistically need everything
from this run?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, because some grows are
just like, pop it, see what it is and move
[SPEAKER_02]: on, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just a little data point,
good reference point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, it's hard to pick
keepers, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is, especially when you get a
little critical about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where like, I mean,
it's obvious, but there really is a limit
[SPEAKER_05]: to the kind of like formal kind of like
data driven side of this, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a part where that just has to end,
like we said earlier, and we just then
[SPEAKER_05]: relying on your like instinct,
yeah, got some kind of like act of God,
[SPEAKER_05]: like roll of the dice, you know,
random arbitrary decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there usually is like a hard
deadline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the scale stuff where it's like,
no, no, no decision has to be made by this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you say, it's a gut decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's instinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, that's when I start leaning
on like, which one's the most potent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I've screened them out,
chances are, if they make it to those
[SPEAKER_00]: final steps, that they're all pretty damn
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when I start really honing
in on effect where I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love this and do other people
also like the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, it's good to be able
to outsource some of that to the masses,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just even the people you're friends
with or work with, whatever, and start
[SPEAKER_00]: crowdsourcing those types of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I honestly think it's the breeder's
job at the end of the day to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: call and to stick by what they know and
what they think and that gut instinct,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's kind of like what you're
developing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, you don't always have a
reason, but you're just like, I like this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that's kind of served me
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also going to say that I typically
find that there's like an instant bias
[SPEAKER_02]: between the plant that you have your eye
on, like when it's growing and when it
[SPEAKER_02]: like comes out in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I often find that that correlates
heavily for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's just me and my
biases, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I always kind of gravitate to the
production ones that are pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow because they look so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually smell good, but I usually
find them a little lackluster in the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: department compared to some of their runty
pain in the ass sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been growing some weird shit
until more recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to be a little more on the map
and out of my own little projects for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while, because it's nice to go through
that exploration phase every few years and
[SPEAKER_00]: just find some more cool cuts from
projects your buddies have done and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand, are you hanging on to any
clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know you're not growing like
massive numbers or anything, but how do
[SPEAKER_01]: you gravitate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're popping seeds,
are you thinking, all right, I'm going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hang out, like, I'm not looking
for someone to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you sort of just having a look
until maybe a later date when it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: conducive to keeping shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, I have been provisioning for
it and I am rerunning some glass onion
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff right now, as well as this like
recent born in one of the born in the
[SPEAKER_05]: purples that I liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for me, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's hard to know how long I can
keep anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some very, very, yeah, you all
three know that some like very severe,
[SPEAKER_05]: like spatial constraints.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm still testing the limits of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can at the moment, like in my nursery,
quote unquote, I've got like, maybe like
[SPEAKER_05]: six plants in there, six individuals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can keep a small number.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think I've done this long
enough to kind of really have seen any
[SPEAKER_05]: patterns yet, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, at this point, I think all I'm
interested in is just seeing how different
[SPEAKER_05]: the clones do like for now, you know,
and just kind of getting like a general
[SPEAKER_05]: appreciation for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I remember asking a farmer Dan and
just in a voice chat once like about how
[SPEAKER_05]: he saw those differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one of the interesting things
he mentioned to me was and correct me if
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wrong, Dan, like for a lot of clones,
it takes like six months for them to sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of stabilize for the hormones to stabilize
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, you know, they tend to
be more stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've just taken them,
they may still behave and grow and express
[SPEAKER_05]: quite a lot like the seed plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on some of the longer
flowering stuff, I've noticed it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of like I don't know if I'm
just like reading into something I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard the guy say that was like an old
Dutch saying or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That that, you know, you want to like a
plant that's from the equatorial region
[SPEAKER_00]: has no like light change pressure,
no environmental pressure from cold that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to kill it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's like this super elongated
time clock for the plant where before it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like ready to flower, whereas like
something from the northern latitudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to flower by a certain date to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: By a certain date to then like die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like it's kind of like in
that kind of realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like how I conceptualize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what was this like gene pool
like originally doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: To any extent, it's hard to say on like a
modern one, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've definitely noticed it on some
longer flowering stuff, even like blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dream types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of see it in certain
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you grow outside is that like
I've popped seeds in like September and
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't flip for like a month,
even though their seedlings outside when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only like 12 and a half hours of
light, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like they have these built in
clocks in them to some degree that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I don't think that we like fully
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to kind of just let my
seedlings chill for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've been blown away by how fast some
people have gotten full size flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from a seed pack on the server.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, no, I'm still in my
four incher over here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just letting her go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe it's because I'm not in a
rush, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like to let things sit for a
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for me, like it was sort of
already kind of indicated towards this,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I think earlier on, I just was hungry
to see more variety, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for the first few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure you still, and that it's not
like that desire is gone, but I think that
[SPEAKER_05]: there is, it's now being increasingly
counterpointed with that tension of like,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, surely you want to see some more,
like some of the same stuff too,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, again and again too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like trying to balance that is
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I always love fuel every time someone
gives me, even if it's like a super
[SPEAKER_00]: purple, like when it's fuel, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm like, I'll smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain things that never go out of style
on fuel is one of those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'm just getting to that point
of, of starting to understand what it is
[SPEAKER_05]: that I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe not even quite why yet,
but yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've been on a journey the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been growing, growing staples
and smoking staples forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good baseline, but it's like,
what do you actually want to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always default to chems and OGs
cause like that's what gets me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I'm sure there's plenty of other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty excited about some of the high
and lonesome stuff I've gotten and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the blueberry stuff I've yet to run and
the blue dream crosses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got some bonnet F2s, did you not as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me an extra pack too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got like, um, 30 to go through
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are 10 packs each.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the box here that he sent me,
but, um, yeah, he sent me all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really stoked that I got some,
uh, some good old Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, um, I've heard some of the guys on
here talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, I feel like I missed
out on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the dog shit is one of those curious
cuts to me that I have not really
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for them, some of the pictures,
I've seen, I'm like, oh, that's right up
[SPEAKER_00]: my alley, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That electric book glue is, uh,
it's got my number.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any final thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking mostly just say, you know,
end of the day, fuck what any of us said,
[SPEAKER_01]: just select what you like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this ended up being quite a cool
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I think, um, we ended up,
I think, you know, more of that gesturing
[SPEAKER_05]: towards all the like, not all,
but a lot of the kind of critical
[SPEAKER_05]: decisions and decision points.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may encounter in selections,
what some of the initial considerations
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and really we did just talk about
breeding as a whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I think where I liked us going
that wasn't prepared, uh, didn't expect
[SPEAKER_05]: rather was like, I think it was cool to
get each of your reflections on like what
[SPEAKER_05]: you thought a good direction or strategy
would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as well, just hearing about some of
your, your more personal tastes and yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially when it gets down to that,
like we said, that empathy.
[SPEAKER_05]: In pass in selection where you're like
information is not going to help me
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think that's all really interesting
that like probably doesn't get talked
[SPEAKER_05]: about enough, um, in like breeding
conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, if nothing else, I'm going to start
shouting out, um, maybe before that,
[SPEAKER_05]: any shout outs from you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just did my whole set the other day,
so I'm good for right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fucking shout out to you,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting us through this one, moderating it
around and Matt hope he's getting better
[SPEAKER_01]: soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not feeling well and yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, we haven't had, you know,
this, this combination of people on
[SPEAKER_05]: before, but like, this is a great team.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and we will be seeing all of them
again really soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, farmer Dan and local probably sooner,
uh, because we're going to do that Z
[SPEAKER_05]: episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could even tell in this one,
like they were both sort of already signed
[SPEAKER_05]: to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, we're going to, we're going
to have a Z episode, a dedicated one,
[SPEAKER_05]: which will be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's going to be, it's going to be a
good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There might even be like the next one we
record potentially I'll be in touch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So otherwise you, yeah, go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, thanks for having
us, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All three of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love any time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to, uh, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see some right seats.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe high and low.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just had a new drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe park might be having a drop
soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in the next few months, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, ride Seacoat Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in Europe, uh, good by seeds,
uh, run by a very own Matt booze over
[SPEAKER_05]: here, uh, for Australia.

[SPEAKER_05]: Um, go check that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'll be by your side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be plugging Matt to add stuff to it
as we go on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll probably have to do another
episode soon, just to kind of give y'all
[SPEAKER_05]: an update on where that's going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but otherwise, yeah, thank you all so
much.
