[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who lived it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-so-Dot, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and then yeah, I tried to join the
live, but I think Matt wanted to get his
[SPEAKER_04]: bejazzling talk out of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to let them know about your new
hobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted that as a monologue,
where I didn't have any chance to object
[SPEAKER_04]: or change the subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that was all, that was all,
it was either technical difficulties or
[SPEAKER_04]: intentional on Matt's part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, I mean, I was just telling
about your new hobby, the way you put your
[SPEAKER_02]: gems and you just get nice adhesives and
stick it real hard and take pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the people that can make a living
doing that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got to make a living somehow,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, you know, I mean, they probably
paid, they probably paid Marky Mark a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: to pose on those Calvin Klein's,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you would imagine so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's not packing heat like I am
though, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, I think there was an unripe
avocado involved or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for artistic impressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so what do we want to cover
today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you want to start?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we thought about, we thought about
putting out like a few different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were requesting certain stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll pay attention to comments if we
can and we'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people were asking about like,
because it's like a big name, like what's
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the super dog, which is I'm kind
of tied into, story is about, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: what some of the Kush story is about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, not to be, we probably
won't get like massively in depth in some
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of step by step because there's a lot
of, I don't know, what would you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of, a lot of toes to step on.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people with money tied to their
story about OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but so, so there's, there's some
legends and there's competing tales and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's stories that you kind of have to
choose who to believe again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's one of the more complicated
ones and, but we can talk about like how
[SPEAKER_04]: it impacted California, which is kind of
really where it got famous.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, you know, Kush,
I, wow, that's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did know Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has been, he's been missing for a super
long time and his family still pays like,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's like hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's, it's one of those,
it's one of those things that someone
[SPEAKER_04]: asked weeks ago to do some missing person
stories or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, yeah, there's people that
have families and friends and loved ones
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's probably not the most like the
coolest thing to chat about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sensitive nature of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you have kids and stuff left
behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, it's just more like,
you know, people, you know, it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: someone goes missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got friends and family that love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have any, and the reason
why there's a huge reward is they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have closure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's pretty gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's horrible, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that kind of stuff, that kind of
stuff happens up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's isolated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But did you catch the obsolete posting
pictures of HLV infected seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I didn't, but, you know,
I was actually, strangely enough,
[SPEAKER_04]: we could talk about that for a second
because it was probably two nights ago or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a pretty long chat with CSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were talking about a bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that it's
interesting is, you know, as you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's got a couple of plants that have
dudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That are just really old and
irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he keeps them, but he keeps them in
a totally separate spot and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, one of them is, one of them
is Callio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's this rumor, you know,
I don't know if it's a rumor, but there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a, there's a tales going around that the
viroid dudding viroid, HLV, whatever the
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck you call it, HPLV or whatever,
not only does it stay alive in plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it passes on to a certain percentage
of seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I think the number is from the hops
people, it was 8% of seeds that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: passed to, but that doesn't necessarily
what people don't understand is that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't necessarily mean that 8% of your
seeds that you pop are going to absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: show it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that it gives it 8% chance and it
could be 8% of the seeds you didn't pop
[SPEAKER_02]: that you had, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, chances is like, so over a huge
number of seeds, you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: all things being equal, your seeds sit
somewhere between like 50, 50 male,
[SPEAKER_04]: female, or 60, 40.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over, over like a large lot, like on a big
average, but I mean, I've popped like 26
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, two packs of like mangoes,
haze and got three girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same, same stuff where you get like zero
females, all males.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or vice versa, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: The law of averages on like a very small
amount is not that great, but I will say
[SPEAKER_04]: the point before I get too distracted is
he grew out some of those hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he didn't see any, he didn't,
he didn't find any evidence of it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that that's, I don't want to
say true, but I don't know how proven that
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how proven that that 8% is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that just hops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it not necessarily cannabis,
which is a hops, you know, relation,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, there's not enough science on it yet
on, uh, as it relates to just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one, no one looks cool smoking their
vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to hide it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, it is interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because, you know, there's an aspect
that we, him and I were also chatting
[SPEAKER_04]: about, which is like, there was an era
where you didn't really worry about,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, disease or bugs too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Powdery mildew was unheard of.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no dud.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no cutting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was this thing where most people
either did their own clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or only supplied their small little tiny
group of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of times diseases or issues
or something like that were fairly
[SPEAKER_04]: localized and didn't really, you never
really heard about them to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in like the two 15 era,
uh, when people, when lots of clubs
[SPEAKER_04]: started selling racks of cuttings for
like, uh, for profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people stopped running their own
veggies, stopped the cake, taking care of
[SPEAKER_04]: their own mother stock and their own
clones and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just decided, fuck that power and
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to buy clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For my next rip from, you know,
my friend at the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's smart cart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, and, and certain companies,
you know, and so that, so in a way it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like those diseases, diseases made their
way to like certain, like nurseries and
[SPEAKER_04]: clearing houses that were supplying a lot
of clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they spread it all over and they
spread it to thousands of different
[SPEAKER_04]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then it kind of became this thing
where now you see it on IG and all this,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's advertisements for viroid tests,
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are taking all kinds of
precautions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had buddies that it came in and,
uh, ripped through their rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there seems, there seems to be
different, different strengths.
[SPEAKER_04]: And different ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, most people don't understand what a
viroid even is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all, everyone in our crew
has at least seen one dud over time to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to experience what that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we all kind of fucking know it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, there was even a thing where I
was listening to a different, an,
[SPEAKER_04]: an, an excerpt from a different podcast
and they were interviewing someone who,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, scientifically studied it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were talking about the different
methods, um, because it's a, it's a,
[SPEAKER_04]: not even a virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a viroid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like little bits of RNA or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and it's like, for the most part,
it's like, it's totally fine in 99%
[SPEAKER_04]: isopropyl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, we've been some,
a couple of good friends of ours,
[SPEAKER_04]: they had some tech at their nurseries
where they had like the, the, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: propane canister and the torch that
attaches to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would torch their, their,
you know, their equipment plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sneaky fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, root to like, like what I saw was
root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like if there, if you have a tray of
clones and you've taken all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains, some are more
susceptible to catching it by the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: and the water, or it's the fucking razor
blade or whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it spreads pretty fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and so then there's an aspect
where it's like, basically what they found
[SPEAKER_04]: is that like, you know, 10 or 15% bleach
for 10 minutes does kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, uh, uh, H2O2, hydrogen peroxide,
the strong shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alcohol doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's something about the chemical
composition of, uh, of bleach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if the vine oxide works.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, there's a few other things that,
that cause that, that kill it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but some of those things are like really
harsh on tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you, you know, so, uh, but then the
interesting thing about bleach is if you
[SPEAKER_04]: buy like store bleach, uh, yeah,
uh, uh, our buddy's skunk just said
[SPEAKER_04]: Vikrons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you buy, if you buy like,
uh, clothing bleach, like sodium
[SPEAKER_04]: hypochloride, that stuff only stays good
once you mix it for like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: five to eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if it gets too dirty,
it goes inert.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Jungle Boys, Jungle Boys was
saying they were using, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it wrong, but it was, um, something
like Sanidate or Oxidate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like one from that company,
Zerotol or I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zerotol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I spilled that shit pure on my
fucking leg once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sterols are tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, for people now that
we've gone this far into it or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you want to use a bleach solution
that stays a lot more lasting and doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: get fucked up super fast, like,
uh, your laundry bleach, uh, get bleach
[SPEAKER_04]: for pools, uh, because that way that's
calcium hypochlorite, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And calcium hypochlorite is, you know,
pools are dirty, you know, they get shit
[SPEAKER_04]: in them and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like as far as, you know, dirt and leaves
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't go inert the same way sodium
hypochlorite does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now people, I mean, I go, I go to the
store and I buy, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like a hundred pack of blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, I just add to the,
you know, every plant gets a new,
[SPEAKER_04]: every plant gets a new blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good habit to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you, you know, you, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's an act, there's aspect to
it where it's like, so what sucks is that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you go somewhere and you see
some really cool tech that somebody's
[SPEAKER_04]: doing and you're like, Oh, I'm going to
incorporate that into my own thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you find out that it actually
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried with, I tried with the Sanidate
and Oxidate on the four way and Trinity
[SPEAKER_02]: cut because both of those have the HLV and
not no dice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to wish you a happy pride.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That right there, I, before I lose it,
cause it'll go off my screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every plant gets its own rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, taking all the precautions to actually
like separate and not cross contaminate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically like dipping in,
having a separate like thing, a clone X
[SPEAKER_02]: for every fucking thing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of that, then you're,
then you got to use Rockwell or you got to
[SPEAKER_04]: use the earth plugs or something like an
easy cloner is like, that's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like making out with people with
the flu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, uh, you know, and,
and so it's hard because there's like real
[SPEAKER_04]: science and bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a long time, we only had bro
science because real science couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: touch weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you how long I have heard
that powdery mildew classes passes to
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been bro science for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I first heard about the HLV thing,
I was very skeptical, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'd seen a lot of people breathe
with duds over the years and never seen
[SPEAKER_02]: the duds pop up in C form, but apparently
the hops people do say it happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean that, that obviously still has
to be checked and, and proven over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how science is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like, it's the best information you
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, you know, we'll, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where that originates from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupidity, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, and, uh, well, you know,
it, it, people to have to understand the
[SPEAKER_04]: life cycle of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like a viroid isn't even a virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like little bits of RNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to have something so small like
that, be able to just fuck us up so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what translaminar means
and I probably should, but I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So translaminar, there's two things,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's vascular where it's moving through
your vascular system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's translaminar,
which is essentially like, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the leaf surface.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in some, for, for instance,
like to give you an example, if you could
[SPEAKER_04]: use a certain kind of poison and it would
be a contact killer, or maybe it would
[SPEAKER_04]: form a relationship and be translaminar
and go on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not systemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be systemic though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have systemic translaminar and
you can have systemic vascular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know systemic vascular,
but I never heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't think systemic would be just
leaf, leaf touching, but I guess that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, well, I mean, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the people humans have figured out
all kinds of different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, um, but he's right in the sense
that PM is, you know, it's like PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hardest thing is to break its life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, um, and that's what people don't
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they mostly break, break its
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it like, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you live in Mendo and you're
surrounded by vineyards and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: else and everybody grows, uh, you know,
we got a crash course 20 years ago and PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wanted to make some equal 20
jokes, but it's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even joke about that shit
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause people take that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, they said avid is a,
uh, avid is we used to call avid the
[SPEAKER_04]: death.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, avid is a translaminar systemic or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you know, 20, 25 years ago,
some of that stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I last, I do remember that spider
mites are not susceptible to things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are systemic because of how deep they go
into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're susceptible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the issue, the issue becomes
really with spider mites specifically is
[SPEAKER_04]: that 20, 25, 30 years ago, there was,
there's a bunch of poisons for spider
[SPEAKER_04]: mites, uh, that are, you know,
all from pretty natural to pretty toxic
[SPEAKER_04]: that worked really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, people overuse these toxins
over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would dip their clones in it every
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just, yeah, they were trying to
take precautions, but what they bred was
[SPEAKER_04]: supermites.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty sure avid wasn't systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the ones that's not,
um, just because it's not, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: systemic doesn't work necessarily with
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't go that far.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe people aren't, there's,
there's vascular systemic and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: translaminar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, when you think about it,
like if something's a contact killer,
[SPEAKER_04]: it means that the bug has to come into
contact to kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's something that's translaminar
and like, and, uh, um, and, and persists
[SPEAKER_04]: within the leaf for a period of time,
it'll kill the bug for that length of time
[SPEAKER_04]: that it persists.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's not necessarily systemic,
if it stays in the plant, that's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: definition of systemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it's also one of those
things though, that it's systemic in the
[SPEAKER_04]: sense that, uh, your plant will test
positive for it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's something specific
about it not being systemic, like what it,
[SPEAKER_02]: what it actually is avid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so I'm a chloropid, which is the
people use for root aphids or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff you can test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that stuff will test dirty one to two
years later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of maybe, I mean,
maybe I'm getting it wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I consider to be systemic is that if
you apply it and then weeks or months
[SPEAKER_04]: later, you can still test for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's around it's in the plant system
somehow, whether that's the leaf system or
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the, you know, and maybe we can look
it up and maybe I'm totally fucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always possible, but that's kind of
how I, that's kind of how I view things is
[SPEAKER_04]: like things that persist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I have no clue to be honest with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember that the, the old saying
that systemic stuff doesn't work on mites
[SPEAKER_02]: cause they don't go deep enough into the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone just asked if you spray avid and
veg, it will absolutely, um, it will
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely persist for some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there used to be, I should say,
I should say this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There used to be this thing where not to
call anybody out or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there was a lot of people that
supplied clubs that knew exactly how many
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks you had to go not spraying it to
test totally clean at the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they would do this thing where like
this gentleman just, just ask,
[SPEAKER_04]: can you spray it in veg?
[SPEAKER_04]: They would spray the shit veg and veg for
X amount of weeks and then bloom for X
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of weeks and then know that it
would be clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in order to, in order to get
around that, uh, the legal testing,
[SPEAKER_04]: it went from PPM to PPB.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: From parts per million to parts per
billion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once it went to parts per billion,
it fucked every, all those people's math
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the rates, they were using it and
everybody was hiding, using it and getting
[SPEAKER_04]: away with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, and so now what's happened
is, is that a lot of these mites have
[SPEAKER_04]: survived decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of people spraying them with all kinds of
funky shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there are a lot, there are a lot
stronger and there are a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: resistant in California than your average
might would be in the wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit in San Diego back in the day,
dude, they would drink out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd take a shot and say, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like they were, they're brutal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's, there's a, it's,
it's not, you know, and then everything
[SPEAKER_04]: gets overused.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like anything else, if you don't
actually eliminate the problem,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you just knock the problem down to low,
low levels and you keep doing that over
[SPEAKER_04]: and over and over again, eventually the
ones that survive are going to be better
[SPEAKER_04]: at resisting whatever you're using.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can be totally organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be evil, like, uh, avid or forbid
or contos or, you know, those aren't evil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like being sued.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, uh, it just, in the sense of,
you know, I mean, everything has its
[SPEAKER_04]: place, I suppose, but, uh, and I don't
want to be, but, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all that stuff comes from the,
the only reason why that shit exists is
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's all over your fucking food.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it doesn't exist for weed
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those, all those crazy chemicals and
stuff, Eagle 20 and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: it all exists because it gets used all the
time in commercial food production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you could even buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back in the day, the big mix in
my roll of crutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't even admit this, but it was,
it was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, before, you know, a lot of the
information was available, even though you
[SPEAKER_02]: could smell it and you could smell the
toxicity, but it was a phyton 27 and
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrocyte immunox mix for some reason
seemed to just knock PM out, but it would
[SPEAKER_02]: also murder your fucking plants,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Immunox is kind of like a derivative.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like another brand name for Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah, the Eagle 20 gets sprayed
for grapes, uh, avid, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_04]: things are designed for ornamentals too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, uh, you know, points set like
the, like the fucking PGR bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where everybody, you know, for a while,
where if you were super unethical and you
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to get two or three pounds of light
and you didn't care about quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: you would PGR your weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, it had, it had a bunch of
names, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Phospho load or, uh, you know,
there was, there was a number of companies
[SPEAKER_04]: that would all hide what it actually was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the same shit that makes like,
when you walk into a grocery store around
[SPEAKER_04]: Christmas and all the points set is the
same fucking height to the inch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because they got treated with a
PGR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think, I think the term PGR has
been demonized just like, uh, GMO or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are great PGRs and I see
people saying, fuck PGS.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you don't even know what you're
talking about because there are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: PGRs that we all use that are decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that, uh, a lot of the
companies would hide the, the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the fucking, uh, what was on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then eventually they got caught onto
and they all got pulled off the shelf or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, uh, sunlight supply came out with
one that they called Dr. Nodes and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: fully vetted through all the, all the
various agencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, uh, my, my buddy had a shop and they
got all these samples and one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: samples was this bottle of Dr. Nodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at it and it was a bottle
and it came in its own plastic sheet that
[SPEAKER_04]: you kind of like almost like a medicine
thing that you had to rip open and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and do that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of its warnings was pregnant women
should not touch the bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's safe though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty heavy, but like on the same,
on the same tip, uh, a natural PGR is
[SPEAKER_04]: kelp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You apply too strong a kelp.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll plan to do some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're right in the sense that it's
just a term that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what most people are thinking of when
they think of PGRs and weed is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and like the name is this long and it's
methyl ethyl and it has a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: parentheses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it's all, it's all kinds of
bad shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, pack low pack, pack low butanol
terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and in addition to, in addition to,
um, making your weed super dense,
[SPEAKER_04]: it fucked with your crystal content and
made your weed a B grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of companies,
and this is even fucked up, even if you
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't evil, uh, and use the shit,
sorry if you used it and I just called you
[SPEAKER_04]: evil, but they didn't put it on the label
and lots of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's other companies that
would put it into like blood blasters and
[SPEAKER_04]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would just put small amounts for
that extra oomph.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all part of that fucking nutrient
game, which I mean, after making the
[SPEAKER_02]: spray, um, and, and learning about
different nutrients, how they're sold,
[SPEAKER_02]: how you get regulated, how you get,
you know, Omri listed, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, to me, like it was like
learning about the vitamin, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, uh, what do they call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you go to those muscle stores or
whatever, you can buy all their
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements, supplements, it's like
supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to, I have to interject too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, someone's couples,
a couple of people said, uh, gravity and
[SPEAKER_04]: shit like that, which is definitely one of
the things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then someone was like, yes,
it was, it's illegal to not have
[SPEAKER_04]: everything on the label.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll be shocked to know that people
making products for cannabis people were
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to do something illegal and that
not all of them had the highest of ethical
[SPEAKER_04]: standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they got that purple max though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that gravity shit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had, I had a friend, uh, who literally
was like an early proponent of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you'd probably call it living
soil today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was super anal about inputs and all
this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he comes in and he buys some of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and all it says on the label is kelp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it had the full pack low in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he goes out there and he makes a
whole resi and he waters all his beds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's, he'd had those beds for like
five, six years and had been developing
[SPEAKER_04]: them every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he went and sprayed him with
Paclo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it wasn't on the, it wasn't on the
label.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thought it was yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody knew to tell him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, yeah, that some of that stuff was
insidious.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were trying to sell you a product
that you'd buy again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and it's just like, I look at it
like drug dealers who press their pills
[SPEAKER_02]: and like, you know, double the strength
that there's annex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course people are going to go back to
that fucking dude if they're wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: get all super fucked up and die.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was even, there's even pesticides
that have gotten caught, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That have gotten pulled from the shelves
in California, uh, because they listed,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, clove oil and this and that and
whatever to kill bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they test it and it's got avid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got avid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got, it's got low amounts of
something that really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they just figure, um,
is someone actually going to analyze my
[SPEAKER_04]: secret sauce?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually people do, you know,
eventually people do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there was a, there's, there's been
times where like, uh, weights and measures
[SPEAKER_04]: has come into grow stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by law, you know, if it says it's 40
ounces, it better be 40 ounces.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says it's X amount of pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It better be that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll pull all their shit off the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it doesn't weigh right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are asking about power.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that's a, um, orthosilic or
monosilicic, um, acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it's, uh, it's a silica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically what it is is it's silica in a
form that's a lot more absorbable for the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of silica out there that is
not that easily plant absorbable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not bioavailable for cannabis unless
you reuse your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and so as a result, uh,
there's, there's a number of cutting edge
[SPEAKER_04]: has one, um, power C is one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of them that put it
basically in a different, in a different
[SPEAKER_04]: suspension.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lack of a better way to put it,
uh, that makes it, uh, that makes silica
[SPEAKER_04]: acid, that makes it a little bit easier
for the roots and the plant to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the few products like that,
that I really actually visually can see
[SPEAKER_02]: change within 24 hours of using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's expensive as fuck, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are talking about, and there's
enzyme products on the market right now
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, enzyme, enzyme products are,
uh, um, I use them a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually there's Newcomb and, and Dr.
Zimes and all these, and they're all
[SPEAKER_04]: basically this, this, they're enzymes that
fuck with the, the eco skeleton of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, of the bug and there's citric acid
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're really gentle and a lot of
more organic and they test clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they absolutely annihilate,
uh, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and they do a pretty good job killing
mites too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still, I'm still a big proponent now
because of you of the, um, what's that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit called?
[SPEAKER_02]: The micro sulfur, micronized sulfur,
micronized sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, micronized sulfur, if you don't
use oils and you spray micronized sulfur,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll never, uh, you'll never have russet
mites, uh, or PM in your veg ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except when I use them both together in
the same bottle, like a absolute fool and
[SPEAKER_02]: every plant that I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, yeah, they'll burn hairs though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I said in veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you'll definitely, uh,
sulfur is a really, uh, distinctive aroma
[SPEAKER_04]: and you definitely don't want to be using
sulfur for any reason much past the first
[SPEAKER_04]: week of flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you start saying to me, uh,
it's, it's not a good idea, but in,
[SPEAKER_04]: in veg, when it's just, it's all sticks
and stems, you know, and, and leaves it's
[SPEAKER_04]: organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, uh, it, uh, it,
it works really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I totally got away from oils simply
because I like sulfur in the rotation as a
[SPEAKER_04]: safety measure in the veg and plants tend
to like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't, so I don't use oils at all
because I, God help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got russets or something like that,
um, you know, it'll, it'll annihilate
[SPEAKER_04]: those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I think it's safe to use indoor,
but I don't like put on masks when I spray
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the fuck do I know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is safe to use indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I put, I would put on masks,
you know, even smart people put on masks.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff, quote unquote,
that's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that I might only put on like,
uh, uh, like, uh, uh, snowboarding shell
[SPEAKER_04]: or something to spray, but I have a full
face mask with a visor and the whole bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it might be safe for your plants,
but that doesn't mean your lungs want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't want to breathe in wettable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to breathe in anything
like on that level, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always wear a mat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to my eyes either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably why I'm fucking blind to be
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, uh, you know, it, uh, it,
I just, I, you know, did I always do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I got older, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I've gotten older, I've tried to,
to be more, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two or $300 full face mask or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even for the most basic stuff,
I put it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone said they started using sulfur
because that guy who said sulfur is how to
[SPEAKER_02]: get our gas terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll definitely make your weed
smell and taste like a tire fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you use it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feed it, uh, to the roots,
it does, you know, increase terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Newcomb, Newcomb and sulfur or Newcomb and
Dr. Zimes and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use them back to back.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not oil in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's completely safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing, something happens when you
combine oil and sulfur, it re it changes
[SPEAKER_04]: the pH on the plant and it burns them to
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It murders them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've so do you, uh, sulfur is sulfur is
very, uh, very, very safe as long as you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't mix it with oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never usually do lines of, um,
pure or wait, I should say if it's
[SPEAKER_04]: overnight, 90 degrees, sulfur can really
hurt your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, don't, if, you know, uh,
we meet me, uh, our buddy and I,
[SPEAKER_04]: we, uh, one of the fires in 2019,
I think it was 2018, maybe, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: we had sprayed sulfur the night before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next day, one of the biggest
fires in California history started a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of Hills over from us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first thing it did was burn out a
bunch of power poles, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was 108 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lighting went out, but sort of the
air conditioning and all the fans and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything we had, cause the power poles
bent and fell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got real hot and we lost a bunch of
moms, um, to sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the day before.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, uh, I mean, there was a lot of
things that sucked about that fire,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, um, I mean, we didn't have power at
that spot for almost two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it was June and you have a
death.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, there was probably,
there was issues, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: so, but yeah, I mean, uh, people,
uh, trying to read and talk or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I didn't even think we actually
bullshitted for on a totally different
[SPEAKER_04]: direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get, don't get sulfur on your
lights, you know, um, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: sulfur, sulfur works better than anything
I've ever seen against Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It absolutely annihilates them and it
annihilates powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had Russet mites in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I should knock on wood somewhere,
but powdery mildew, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's even a problem in Bakersfield where
it's super dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, do you know that, do you know
that they consider a Russet mites
[SPEAKER_04]: areoplankton?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever heard that word areoplankton?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So area, so obviously plankton in the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just get carried around by the
currents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Russets are so small.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can get just carried by wind currents
for long distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, that's why they call them
areoplankton because it's like living
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are just getting carried along
by current, in this case, wind current.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could have a neighbor, a couple of
hills over and the wind could be going the
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they could definitely start blowing
off their plants and right up the hill and
[SPEAKER_04]: right up into your ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how a lot of people got them in
Mendo actually was they spread neighbor to
[SPEAKER_04]: neighbor, farm to farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be, you'd be downwind from someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about July, August, their garden would
fuck you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you could take all the precautions
in the world about quarantine and bringing
[SPEAKER_04]: in clean stuff and not allowing pests in,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they came in on the wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ain't that a bitch?
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody just said spinosad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's, there's, I'm sure there
is, spinosad is a cool story actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've ever heard it,
but spinosad is like a, is basically a bug
[SPEAKER_04]: killing fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they discovered it in the Caribbean,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an old rum mill and they went
into this big old factory, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: rum factory and they noticed there was no
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of them, there was like zero,
no spiders, no bugs of any kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they took soil samples and they found
spinosad A and D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what that's what, when you buy
spinosad, that's what, that's what it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes from them discovering this thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reason why you shouldn't fucking
use it is that it is, it is terrible for
[SPEAKER_04]: us bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is one of the most toxic things for
bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's safe for you and it's safe for
people and animals and all that type of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, but it'll take out a whole beehive.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not, it's not, you know,
I mean, I guess if you were indoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could safely use it on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you really wouldn't have too much risk
or be, or, you know, be an asshole about
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're going to spray it on a bunch
of your, your depths or your outdoors or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that, you might kill the
natural bees all in your area.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might just take them all out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have their own, they have,
they have enough struggles going on right
[SPEAKER_04]: now, be populations with a lot of things
that are fucking with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would definitely, I, I could never
in, in good conscience, recommend somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: use it in their depth or their outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it also hears some shit on
OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we can get to that sucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just, we just took it in, we just took
it in that direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, there's a bunch of people
listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if, if we talked about certain things
and, and why not to use them, that's cool
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the reason when people say
Oklahoma or California, there's testing
[SPEAKER_04]: for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not because it's harmful to humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because bees pollinate half of our
food sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we really, really don't want them
to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are dying at a rapid rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're dying at a rapid rate from a
bunch of different issues and from a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of exposure to toxins and pesticides and
herbicides and other, and other stresses
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And literally there's an immense amount of
stuff that you eat that wouldn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't for bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So spraying a shit ton of bee killer,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little rough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, all right, so we can, we can talk,
we can talk about Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this already just, I just totally
changed my mind and don't want to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, but I mean, it, it, there could
be, there could be, now that we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: chatting about it for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, not right now, but like our
experiences in the future or people want
[SPEAKER_04]: to know about pesticide or, or tech or how
to beat certain things or what works or
[SPEAKER_04]: what doesn't, um, living up here
surrounded by growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've kind of seen about just about
everything tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you start to poke around and what
works and what doesn't, what, what are the
[SPEAKER_04]: downsides to this thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause most things have downsides,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to pick which ones you're okay
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people want to hear about OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of things or like a lot of
famous stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's not mine or Matt's story.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have nothing to do with OG by any
means, you know, but we, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what we thought like, so there's,
there's like the most mysterious part
[SPEAKER_04]: about it is the, is the Florida history,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts getting a little bit more
definitive and understood once it got to
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we thought is like, obviously this
is like, I mean, there's been whole shows
[SPEAKER_04]: where people confidently talk about the
origins of OG and this and that and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a bunch of stories because
it's so famous of various people trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: lay claim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's somebody in Hawaii who says his
dad did it, you know, uh, that's my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite was, was, was the underground
bunker, Frank Gee Gax story that Frank Gee
[SPEAKER_02]: Gax said is not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my personal favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, there's, there's the,
like, there's a story that it's Neville
[SPEAKER_04]: work that got sent to Hawaii, uh,
and made his way to Florida from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville did have apparently many backups
everywhere that we don't know about.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, you know, there's a story,
like you just said that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Frank is a guy that had a bunch of,
uh, basically undergrounds and warehouses
[SPEAKER_04]: and big grows, uh, in the Southwest,
uh, you know, uh, United States,
[SPEAKER_04]: Arizona, Arizona and New Mexico ish and
all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, there's rumor that it came from
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it certainly seems guaranteed to have
come from Florida people coming out this
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Fatty did meet, uh, old Dave
Richards.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was there when, when I met that guy and
he was, he had a circle around him telling
[SPEAKER_02]: the tales of OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how he fucking made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've met, uh, I've met,
uh, Dave Richards.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a character.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you meet him?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I met him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, he smokes black and miles on one of
those fucking things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked him in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, I'm not even gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's a funny dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's, he's personable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's personable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard not to like him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I realized how much he was lying
to me, I was like, okay, come on,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was so easy to snap.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's personable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a, there's an aspect
where... Oh, Mark's Castle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, there's basically what it boils
down to is that Kush became one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: things that ended up being so famous and
made so many people money that there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people invested in trying to be
like, you should give me rep because my
[SPEAKER_04]: crew or my family or my whatever,
my friends are the ones that brought this
[SPEAKER_04]: to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people come out of the woodwork,
you know, I mean, and I'm not trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: call individuals out, but it's like,
there's everything from those crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: stories we told you to the one that Matt
and I tend to believe, which there was
[SPEAKER_04]: like an accident in a closet and it came
out of some bag seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: to ever changing story from TK origins
with different years and different plants
[SPEAKER_04]: and different certainties, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's also possible too that
like, it's, you know, it's, it went,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was, it was strains by a different
name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we just know it is Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, we, we, you know,
Neville told, Neville told Matt that he
[SPEAKER_04]: thought that most of the American Kush
stuff was based off his Kush for NL2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it was all just,
it was all just phenos of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just thought it was NL2 expression out
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought this is NL2.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obvious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, and then, you know,
there's, so there's all these different
[SPEAKER_04]: things, but what, regardless of all that,
you know, yeah, someone, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's, there's a bunch of rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since we don't know any of the
parents, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows basically anyone to step in and
say, fucking, this is the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I also think because the way
OG expresses being long and lanky with
[SPEAKER_02]: dense nugs, so it looks like what we would
consider traditionally as like a sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's so long and lanky,
but then it has these dense nugs and
[SPEAKER_02]: resin, like an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really easy to just make up
bullshit and be like, oh, that's a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: Nepalese and just some random sativa and
some random Afghani.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we'll go way the fuck back for a
second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start, start at the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the very beginning of Kush in America,
and we have no idea if this, relates to
[SPEAKER_04]: the Kush that everyone is familiar with,
but people would bring back seed from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hindu Kush mountain region of Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those mountain valleys had the Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the first term.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam Skunkman had a Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the Hindu Kush mountain region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hindu Kush mountain region.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Indian supposedly gave Seattle Greg a
Kush that got put into NL2, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's various ones, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it used to be a generalized term
for a region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where now, if you fast forward 40 years
today, it basically goes back to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the Kush that went to LA,
the TK, that type of thing is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what everyone thinks of is Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it went from like a region and all
these different Afghans within that region
[SPEAKER_04]: to like a very specific pheno expression
and look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now if you talk about Kush today,
you're not talking about the region
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore with anyone, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, never.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're specifically talking about a
specific phenotypic expression and a look,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's variance within that look,
but it's got some key characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one second, just for everyone that
keeps mentioning the Paki, Lem,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Tai, I will tell the actual story
behind how that came to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll laugh your ass off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's continue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, so it started off as a region,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we should talk about the region
for just a second, because it might
[SPEAKER_04]: interest people, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have this theory and I've seen it in
some different places and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've bounced it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wouldn't say it's like a theory
that's like, you know, you couldn't poke
[SPEAKER_04]: holes in, but I think it can hold
generally true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if you look at Afghanistan,
there is parts of Afghanistan that are
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere from sea level all the way up to
10,000 feet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of different elevations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Mazar, that region, that's maybe
only 800 feet above sea level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's areas on the Hindu Kush
valleys that are five, six, seven thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: feet where they grow vegetables and wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what tends to be is that when you
get the lowland Afghans that are in the
[SPEAKER_04]: foot hills or the plains or sea level in
Pakistan or Afghanistan, they tend to be
[SPEAKER_04]: these squat, bigger, like fluffier plants
with much wider leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not as dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're growing in more humid areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're lower to the ground and they
have these big fat wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get up into these high
mountain regions.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which also has Afghans and those Afghans
kind of sound a lot like what Matt
[SPEAKER_04]: described with the Kush that everyone's
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Skinny leaves, but indica.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not big fat wide leaves, but skinny
leaves, golf ball type, much tighter type
[SPEAKER_04]: nugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think about the environment that
they're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cold, colder, drier, a lot more UV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the leaves are smaller because
catching all that UV is bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The intensity is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was talking about this with CSI
because I don't have a lot of experience
[SPEAKER_02]: with outdoor other than a few,
you know, like depth runs in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I noticed that even with the NL5s,
they're expressing way more narrow
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a trait that outdoors,
because of humidity and other things and
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiration, they're just naturally more
narrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant's going to have a range of
expressions based on all kinds of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he only just said,
you know, UV protection.
[SPEAKER_04]: The higher up you go in elevation,
the less atmosphere there is, the less UV
[SPEAKER_04]: is filtered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so obviously, even though the plant
might come from Afghanistan, if it
[SPEAKER_04]: developed in a valley that's six or seven
thousand feet above sea level and it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: mountain region, that kind of cold and
day, night temperatures and a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: things, it's going to have different
breeding pressures and different plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that are successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Versus a lowland plant from the plane that
gets, you know, moisture off the ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a different kind of
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a lot of misconception
where people think all thin leaf is sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: and the broader and fatter it is,
the more indica it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have narrow leaf, pure indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it just happens to it's just
usually highland weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not lowland weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I think that's a big
misconception.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a major
misconception.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is all indica and all Afghan, the broader,
the broader is the more Afghan and the
[SPEAKER_04]: narrower is the more sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and maybe if you cross the
broadleaf Afghan to a narrow leaf sativa,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be true in the children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so now so so anyway,
so there's highland Afghan.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of there's a lot of mountain
valley weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a bunch of weed coming over to
America called Hindu Kush because that was
[SPEAKER_04]: the big mountain range and all the valleys
that that it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And dirty old sagas saying there's hash
plants because those were all hash plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Lebanese, my red lead that I had was
also narrow leaf, but it grew like a big
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghan sideways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was real fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's just, you know,
like a lot of times and it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you read books and you see what
you're familiar with in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's certain assumptions that get
made, but they're not always the true
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and you know, and and you know,
narrow and and what I mean by narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: is just like obviously there's a range.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodhi has a lot of really good narrow leaf
Afghanis and Pakistanis put out if people
[SPEAKER_02]: are interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's just and so a lot of times I,
I believe very strongly, I can't say it's
[SPEAKER_04]: a hundred percent fact, but I believe very
strongly that almost all those narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: Indica types developed in high altitude
regions of those mountain ranges where
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't need as much leaf to capture
light.
[SPEAKER_04]: They needed less of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because each leaf has a job.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's there at transpire water and it's
there to catch sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That trees and water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, if it, if it on my buddy,
I was visiting my friend yesterday and he
[SPEAKER_04]: was showing me an Afghan and it was thin
leafed and fluffy as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the leaf has a job and if
it's way up there in the mountain valleys
[SPEAKER_04]: and it can do its job on a skinny leaf,
then it's not going to put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: effort into growing a big fat thick leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a narrow leaf Indica type or
hybrid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ercol expresses many different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it be narrow and I've seen it be
broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of those that, that it depends on
the room, the environment, how,
[SPEAKER_02]: how narrow or broad it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just as a general thing, um,
a lot of times people, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: people judge narrow or wide based on,
and, and make guesses based on how Sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: or how Indica, but that's not the whole
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I honestly think Mac can tell the
story about the Paki and the tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think some of the, some of the,
the Kush that we're familiar with,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of its narrow leaf characteristics,
um, led people to believe there was Sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think the stretchiness and all
that shit and definitely it wasn't as
[SPEAKER_02]: broad as a lot of Afghans, despite the
density, but the story originated from,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were two brothers back in the day
that went by brothel brothers and one
[SPEAKER_02]: would call himself Kailua kid and the
other called himself NYC kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, both I think are still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know NYC kid is still, but back then,
uh, Kailua kid who also went later on to
[SPEAKER_02]: start Trichome Kings and a few other
things and paradise seeds mod was another
[SPEAKER_02]: name of his.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made the claim that he bred OG and that
it was Pakistani crossed a lemon tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon tie was a Dutch flower string.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, there are ties that are
lemony, but the one he was referring to as
[SPEAKER_02]: a Dutch flower strain and he's not in
fucking OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, isn't this, that's one of the oldest
stories that's been shot down more than
[SPEAKER_02]: almost any OG Kush origin story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to this day, to this day, people still
fucking repeat that shit ad nauseam
[SPEAKER_02]: because they don't know that the guy was a
major scammer that started the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's fucked all of us, all of us back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he made a lot of claims about
Asian fantasy and all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_02]: stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just what he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I remember at one point he was selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He called dog, dog, but ass ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I kind of called him out on his
type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fuck, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got him in a, in a bag labeled dog,
doggy, doggy, but weed, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: close enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the guy that they're relying on
for that story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the, the second story that we were
talking about, the Frank Gigak story,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was started by a guy named Dave
Richards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he told the story on Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came out and he actually, I believe
Adam Dunn at one of the Adam Dunn cups
[SPEAKER_02]: gave him a lifetime achievement award for
breeding and bringing OG Kush to the
[SPEAKER_02]: masses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unfortunately, Dave Richards made a
lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first ones was that it was a,
it was a hash plant Thai Afghani,
[SPEAKER_02]: which he kept referring to as HTAF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now HTAF is an old term from DJ Short
referring to Highland Thai Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was confabulating different stuff to
make his story.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also said that Frank Gigaks left a book
behind, um, with the breeding tips on OG
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and everything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I spoke to Frank Gigaks directly and
his daughter, I went to lunch with his
[SPEAKER_02]: daughter and breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went into a few different things,
but, um, I talked to Frank Gigaks over the
[SPEAKER_02]: phone and he said that he wrote that book
as a grow book for dummies in prison
[SPEAKER_02]: because he had nothing else to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dave's story and also Frank Gigaks said
they never bred there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only commercial production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, he gave a few different lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was like NL for something
weird that I don't think you probably had,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, big bud, skunk one and something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, we did no breeding there
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he completely smashed that story to
smithereens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but still people, again, repeat it
constantly to this day as truth because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was aired once on a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, but those are the probably
two of the biggest ones, the third being,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the creepy story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, I, I don't think anybody
that's been around a long time even gives
[SPEAKER_02]: that dude any kind of credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even worth addressing,
to be honest with you on the creepy thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what, you know, and then there's,
there's, there's the story of how,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there was accidental
pollinations in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so really what, what it seems
like, it does seem to me at least is that
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe that there was multiple
people that brought Kush from Florida to
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's factual, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, we're, you know,
because obviously people know about
[SPEAKER_04]: cornbread Ricky and TK, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He sent that out before he came out
physically himself to the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, people know about, uh, uh,
Matt Bubba and, uh, and, uh, Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_04]: and, uh, Josh D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say, I'll say flat out when I,
when I first talked to Matt, I thought he
[SPEAKER_02]: was full of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he comes off like a little bit of a
used car salesman.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you talk to him, he's very friendly,
but it's his, it's like his nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't believe him, but everything
that I've ever researched and found is he
[SPEAKER_02]: has not been wrong once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as much as I was biased against
him, I've told him, dude, like I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: propose in your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, like I don't believe you,
but I can't poke holes in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm left with a truth as far as I can
tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an aspect where, and Bubba,
Bubba, and that Kush that went to LA
[SPEAKER_04]: became very famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: TK became very famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's a strain that got sent to the
Bay, uh, that we called the Florida,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, that I've chatted about before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I posted about, um, that went into
cookie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and so what we don't know for sure,
uh, uh, Irene, Irene comes a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: later, but that's another beautiful Kush
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but there are, there were multiple
people that got Kush to California to
[SPEAKER_04]: different people at different years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Slow down real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think, I think people would be
interested in the Irene story a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Irene, I'll let you tell it because,
uh, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the original Irene is as, as best I can
remember, I wish rude boy was here right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, but, um, the original Irene was
picked from a bag of weed that went from
[SPEAKER_02]: California to Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was kind of cool was that we were
able to link up resin lung and his crew
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Atlanta crew and how they were
shipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we said it a few times,
but you can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they shifted a certain way and it
was so unique that when they were both
[SPEAKER_02]: telling the story, it was like,
holy fuck, there's no way that just made
[SPEAKER_02]: that one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that nobody would think
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was originally from a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to say either the first Irene
was from a bag of Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the second Irene that they picked after
they lost the first Irene, they picked
[SPEAKER_02]: another selection that was the most
similar to the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that came out of Larry OG,
if I remember correctly, but that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: rough story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Irene that we have now is what you
would consider Irene too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the one almost everyone has
grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a few people like smoked herb and
rude boy, uh, really experienced the first
[SPEAKER_02]: Irene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so there's, so basically if you
move past the, uh, the, the origin,
[SPEAKER_04]: origin stories, right of who's responsible
for it or where it came from, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: of which there are many, um, there was,
it does seem like the stuff that we know
[SPEAKER_04]: of, uh, made its way from Florida to
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know exactly if all those
things were the same cuts or there was
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple cuts that came out or there is
possibility that there's a cut that shared
[SPEAKER_04]: a name and was called different things by
different crews.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are totally possible, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, what really happened is,
you know, uh, uh, Bubba Kush, Matt Bubba,
[SPEAKER_04]: he brought, he, him and Josh D brought out
Bubba and that, and a couple other strains
[SPEAKER_04]: from Florida to, uh, uh, a neighborhood
out in LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, they started growing some rooms
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happened, I think in LA,
is that LA is such a, is such a hype town
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's, it's, it's so about flash and
it's so about like who has what,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's alcohol or cars or watches or
clothes or whatever that Kush caught on
[SPEAKER_04]: with a certain clientele and then
everybody had to have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so demand went through the roof
and you know, there was only so much of it
[SPEAKER_04]: being grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and so wholesale became crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so it became worth a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what was, what was, uh,
you know, what, what was it going for back
[SPEAKER_04]: then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 7,200.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was wholesale.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six to eight K, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and, and it, it gave you status if
you had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just became this craze in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the beginning, there wasn't very
many, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the nature of LA we've talked about
this before with seed companies,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the nature of LA, uh, to everybody to
pop up with their own shit, nobody down
[SPEAKER_04]: there wanted to give anybody else credit
for how they got theirs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bullshit and the, and the stories
started happening immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and the Bubba, just so everybody
knows the Bubba that, that Matt Bubba
[SPEAKER_04]: brought out, it died by 98.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bubba that everybody has now is not
the first Bubba that came to, who came out
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, Bubba is, is such a specific type
and breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably something similar,
but yeah, that's so, I mean, they found
[SPEAKER_04]: the, I believe the story is it might even
be somebody like rascal or somebody like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone found someone tied in found bag
seed in original Bubba.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Shaw.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I, uh, they, well, I think the thing
is, is that, and I think that's why it got
[SPEAKER_04]: named Bubba Kushner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they thought Kush pollinated the
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Matt Bubba's story, if I remember
correctly, and he can correct me on this,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that Bubba is a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubba Kush is a hybrid of Bubba and OG and
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the original order lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the original Bubba that came out is no
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody has what everybody, regardless
of how you want to believe the story,
[SPEAKER_04]: according to Matt, who brought it out,
they lost the first plant that they called
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bubba Kush is a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of that plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to get really confusing within five
or 10 years of this plant hitting LA,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a whole family of what you call
pure Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Malibu pure Kush, Topanga Canyon pure
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only knew of one pure Kush in Southern
California and it was called pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't LA pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't fucking, there was no Hollywood,
no Malibu, none of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No Malibu, no Topanga, no Sush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called pure Kush and it was a lanky
ass OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was OG and then there was
Kush and then there was OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden there's a valley
cut, there's the SFV, there's a Larry,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a this, there's a that,
there's a blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden the names start
proliferating, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the point where, I don't know,
by, you know, 05, 06, 07, there was
[SPEAKER_04]: probably most, the clubs and it was so
popular that probably most of what clubs
[SPEAKER_04]: sold in Los Angeles was Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was probably 20 or 30 different
Kushes on the menu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we really don't know how many
original things these things started from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have a buddy that came to one
of our Can Illuminati parties,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was telling the story about how he
had bought a couple of pounds of Kush for
[SPEAKER_04]: 8,000 bucks, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he brought it home and he starts
breaking up the weed and a couple of seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's looking at two seeds from an
$8,000 pound that nobody can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he spent the next two days looking
at every bud per seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that became, I think, the poison OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, cost us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The poison.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he bought two pounds for 16,000
bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, dude, I'm just rolling my
first joint at home and I hear a seed hit
[SPEAKER_04]: the table and roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at this seed and I'm like,
I just spent eight grand a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder if there's more seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if the weed looks like this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so every seed, you know, and we have a
good buddy who got the Kush in 99,
[SPEAKER_04]: we think, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's tied into some of the first people
outside of Matt and Josh D that got it in
[SPEAKER_04]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was one of the guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the people intimately involved
in running it very early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we heard a lot of tales from him
about sort of like how it spread and how
[SPEAKER_04]: it started and what it was like and the
politics in the clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times clubs would name something
because they wanted to be the only club
[SPEAKER_04]: with the Louie or the only club with the
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has this funny story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell it like him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has a great accent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could never tell anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some, there was some Armenian
that, you know, he would always joke about
[SPEAKER_04]: and like, he would be like, and he would
be like $250,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he wanted for one rooted snip
of his OG that he had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and so, you know,
it, yeah, but imagine paying $8,000 a
[SPEAKER_04]: pound and you find it seeded to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: That just meant he was going to be able to
grow some of those seeds and grow his own
[SPEAKER_04]: $8,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was excited as all fucking get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he was stoked because that gave
him away where it's like before it was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, there wasn't, you think about the
demand of LA and how many people live in
[SPEAKER_04]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how much wealth there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when there's only a few garages or a
few rooms of these things cracking,
[SPEAKER_04]: it goes fucking lickety split.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's way more demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so changed weed from then on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe we should, maybe we should
take a step back from the story because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there's lots of people that like
to talk specifics about the origins and
[SPEAKER_04]: how they're tied into it and all that
fucking bullshit or whatever, but what
[SPEAKER_04]: happened is, is because that weed was
worth so much money, and because it became
[SPEAKER_04]: so popular in this area that had like 25
million humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sort of like a pop culture,
like, you know, melting pot for lack of a
[SPEAKER_04]: better term, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit blew up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden all these
different names popped up and everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to have their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what that also started doing was
because brokers could make more money off
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush, they started pushing all these
people 800 miles away in Mendocino and
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt and Stuff County, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To grow weed that they could make more
money off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't want, I mean, you know,
like my buddy who gave me the Flow Rider,
[SPEAKER_04]: he didn't do it out of generosity.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did it because I was giving him the
super dog and the dog and the Maui and the
[SPEAKER_04]: super skunk and different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had this Kush that he could make
way better margins.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was like, give me that, grow this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't tell me he was going to make way
more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know that that was the rake
down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what it did is it pushed a lot of
people to start growing similar stuff to
[SPEAKER_04]: feed the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the purple craze that we talked about
before with Caleb and all that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that sort of started like the,
do you have this clone only and you better
[SPEAKER_04]: have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have this specific clone only,
I'll buy all your weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't, it's going to be less.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe, maybe I will, maybe I won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kush was another wave just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could sell every gram of Kush you
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so brokers started going around and
started trying to giving their,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like who fucking ghost,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was people that sold cuts of Kush
for 30 to 50,000, a hundred thousand,
[SPEAKER_04]: $200,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, yeah, because they could,
then they could fill rooms with it and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was like an investment.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was violence over Kush, which is how
the, you know, I mean, I don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't really like to tell that story
too much, but it does seem like the,
[SPEAKER_04]: what I call the 56 day headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Started out named, named something else in
the Kush crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was some stress and some
violence and some whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they fled the, they fled to the bay
and they wanted to call it something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they didn't get in trouble for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they chose the name headband.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then, you know, there's a
lot of people that, Oh, well, what,
[SPEAKER_04]: what cut when we should talk about this
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I firmly believe that the cut that Josh
brought to LA first with Matt,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really hard to figure out the
lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean as far as like what's
actually in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of people that think when
they get ghost, that that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of people that think when
they get 92 OG, that that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of people that think when
they pop Josh D OG seeds that it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: but forget about that one for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying some people think SFB,
some people think Josh, some people think
[SPEAKER_04]: ghost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people think 92, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone mentioned that earlier again,
you know, and our buddy said he doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: think any of those are it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happened in LA is everybody came
up with all these different names.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even like there's one SFB.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few that float around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not just one Tahoe, not one Larry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's multiples.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you consider is like SFB is it,
there might have been one time when,
[SPEAKER_04]: when it was called it, but a lot of what's
currently circulated right now is that
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the people that bought ghost
off ghosts, like 20 years ago for high
[SPEAKER_04]: dollar, they don't think the ghost cut is
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get passed around.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what they got 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the guy that goes around is ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that people talk about is not the same
ghost that had the cut and traded with
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon kid from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people confuse this Kelly guy with
the original guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of the ghost cut right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't the first ghost cut and what
everybody knows is ghost grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't the first ghost that passed the
ghost cut who now lives in the Midwest
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if ghost grows the same
one is the one that was going around
[SPEAKER_02]: calling himself Kelly Cush farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't the Michigan ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Michigan ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to one of his buddies and he
asked to be put back in touch with Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the first time I realized that
the ghost that was kind of hanging around
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon kid, wasn't the same ghost that
passed the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put them back in touch, but I don't
know what happened from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are, people are ripping through
the stories or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's because the first people that the
first people that brought it out,
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes with certain strains,
you lose chain of custody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, there was an issue where
freaking, uh, you know, uh, I don't think
[SPEAKER_04]: Josh will get too mad if I say this,
but like Josh lost the cut in an accident
[SPEAKER_04]: and none of his friends in LA wanted to
give it back to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had another story and he had to go
to a friend in the Bay that he had stashed
[SPEAKER_04]: it with to get it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's typical weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people were like, Oh, it didn't
even matter that he was the guy that they
[SPEAKER_04]: got it from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a lot of these original guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That had it, they lost it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and there's an aspect where it's
like, and I don't mean, I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_04]: that like people have fake ghosts.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm saying is, is that there's four
or five cuts out there that all claim to
[SPEAKER_04]: be the cut that Matt and Josh brought to
LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those cuts, if you grow them side by
side, they're not the same cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't, and I don't mean like not
the same cut that they first brought.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not the same cut to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the same room at the same time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then how do you know, how do you know
what, you know, and nobody called 92,
[SPEAKER_04]: 92.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that's a more recent adaptation to
the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a more recent adaptation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first name, there was no going back to
like, when it was first around for a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of years, no one called it 92.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That came later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, we don't, people don't
know, I don't know if the 92 Hollywood
[SPEAKER_04]: Hills cut is the same as the flow rider.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could the flow rider be the exact same cut
that Josh brought out to California,
[SPEAKER_04]: to LA?
[SPEAKER_04]: It could.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I got that one early,
but I didn't get the Josh cut early and I
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't get it with provenance that I would
know for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people keep asking about the Shug
Knight and the Kushmore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That story is a bag of worms that no one
wants to touch because nobody has any
[SPEAKER_02]: facts really around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's rumors going around that
they might have some relation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one, the one that you think would came
first might not be the one that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: is the first one between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so, so there's a lot,
there's basically, I bet there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of people that have different named OGs
out there that are the same OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one guy's, one guy's Larry could be
another guy's SFB could be another guy's
[SPEAKER_04]: ghost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these names became
interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you start adding names and then
you start getting Lou Louis and fire and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Diablo and, and, and da da da da
da.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's all the pure Kush names and
all those riffs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the master Kush's and two
or three of the master Kush's look like
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubba Kush's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them that I used to have was
tall and lanky and dark and very stringy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think two dogs, I still think two
dog has the f*****g SoCal master.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I see it, it looks exactly like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell's angels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people say that, yeah,
you could, you could probably name and
[SPEAKER_04]: there was probably a 10 year period where
like you could walk into a club and they
[SPEAKER_04]: would have 20, 25 different names on the
menu of Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, some, some collectors out here were
only OGs and that was their s**t.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we only carry OGs and it would be a
f*****g list of like 40 different OGs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's funny is that, you know,
that f*****g dude ghost grow or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: He rages because there's people in LA that
their entire career has just been learning
[SPEAKER_04]: how to grow Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And selling it for high dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had such a long successful popular
run before things changed that some
[SPEAKER_04]: people's entire careers have just been
cropping Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but there's no, like there's,
so there's this aspect where because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the most famous families of weed
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of origin stories and
there's a bunch of claims and probably
[SPEAKER_04]: most of the cuts that came out of LA are
bad seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: One would think, and then sometimes that's
what I always thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then sometimes a different crew would
get it and they'd throw a different name
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just renames and bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, I mean, I like Josh or
whatever, but Josh did the stupid f*****g
[SPEAKER_04]: thing where he took, he took like what H A
O G and something else and something and
[SPEAKER_04]: crossed it all together and then called it
original Josh D.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was Karma who did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Karma's doing not, not Josh D's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well then yeah, Karma can suck it because,
because there's an obvious play to tie it
[SPEAKER_04]: to, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use like triangle Kush and O G and H A O G
and something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we never heard, when was the first
time you even heard the word 90?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you even hear the term 92 O G the
first 10 years you heard about O G?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really hear that until like four
or five years ago, the 92 attachment that
[SPEAKER_02]: specific year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now people are like, oh,
well, is this, this should be the first
[SPEAKER_04]: one, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 92.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the one that started it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like one of the more recent O G
names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, how did the Louie get started?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did the fire get started?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did the, this get started?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's hard to find these stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people don't have a interest in
honesty.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they were trying to do is sell a
different Kush for a high dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature farm has all those old something
and they aren't dutted.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got KNF cures duds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen his movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen his movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got everything you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he doesn't do any like negative
testing or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know, he just knows he's just got
the sense, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, fire O G is rascal SFV or
maybe fire O G to somebody else is
[SPEAKER_04]: something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire O G is a, a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it came out of a tray of clones and it
wasn't, I don't know which specific O G it
[SPEAKER_02]: was, but, and I don't think he was told
anything more than O G and it was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he called it fire O G.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on, um, Swerve made a cross
of fire O G and something else if I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember correctly and called it rascal O
G.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's one of those things that one
of the biggest things about O G is that O
[SPEAKER_04]: G O G and sour, but especially O G are,
is probably one of the first strains that
[SPEAKER_04]: like it just dominated breeding and
hybrids for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and what's interesting is like,
for a long time and maybe we should talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about this for a second, but for a long
time, um, people would work O G's and they
[SPEAKER_04]: would breed with O G's and they would S
one them and kind of the best Fino would
[SPEAKER_04]: be the one that looked like mom.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, you wouldn't find a bunch of
shit and the good ones would be the ones
[SPEAKER_04]: that look exactly like the parent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Caleb, uh, reversed the TK and he
got a much wider variety of cool Finos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he found ghost in there and he found,
he found ones that looked like a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: popular ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's like one of those ways
for a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a breeder to know that you have
like, uh, you have a mother type situation
[SPEAKER_02]: of a bunch of other cuts is when you S one
it, and you're seeing all those sister and
[SPEAKER_02]: brother Finos popping out of what you just
made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you kind of get the idea
that trying to find a good one might be
[SPEAKER_02]: the predecessor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's interesting because if,
if you know, if there was bag seed and
[SPEAKER_04]: there was multiple push strains found in
that bag seed, then the initial bag seed
[SPEAKER_04]: would probably be a hybrid, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and you know, it seems like there's,
there's at least one, maybe the few cush
[SPEAKER_04]: is out there that throw much wider,
Finos than most of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it almost leads it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost leads you to believe that a lot
of these cush is our lucky bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: that people found and named, but because
it's an S1 of Kush already, it kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like itself, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the reasons why Caleb and I
believe that the Chemdog, the 91 itself,
[SPEAKER_04]: might be an S1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it throws such a narrow band of
phenoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Physically, it doesn't look very
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potency-wise, it can bury quite a bit in
some places.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a really narrow band of
physical expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of Kushes are like that,
probably because they're bagsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also interesting, too, that two of
the most famous strains out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Kush and the Sour Diesel, neither one
of them reverse very easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of failure with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of times, things get reversed
onto them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only real OGs I'm seeing people
regularly reverse are OG hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to get lucky and find something
that'll reverse well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of these old OG cuts,
be it bagsy to bagsy, and we're finding
[SPEAKER_02]: that S2s, S3s, shit like that,
doesn't reverse well.
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever reason, it's really hard to
reverse multiple bagsy generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes sense for OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense for a lot of these OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, yeah, they ended up getting
out-crossed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people would reverse some of them
looking for better shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best shit that they would find was
the shit that looked like the shit they
[SPEAKER_04]: already had.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got kind of over OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because while I think it is an amazing
strain, and I'm not here trying to diss it
[SPEAKER_04]: or anything like that, I don't think that
its genetic expression is wide enough that
[SPEAKER_04]: you would need to keep 20 different ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, this one's earthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's lemony.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one has a slight hint of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's more tennis balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's darker.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone wants you to S1 the hog's breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't run it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it started getting past, I dropped
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody asked an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does S2 and S3 and all that get
harder?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what happens is you're selfing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's only one set of genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so every time you self, you increase
the propensity of recessive traits that
[SPEAKER_04]: are negative to be able to pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the deeper you go into selfing,
the more narrower you're putting the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when issues start happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why there's rules against anything
for humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not allowed to bang your sister or
your first cousin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't go well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or your mom or your uncle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you, from personal experience,
this shit sucks, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it took out the whole royal
families of Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: They needed some out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kept selfing, essentially,
almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as things get more narrow,
a lot of times, S3, S4, it starts getting
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot weaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts getting a lot more prone to lack
of vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stress, other aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of regular breeding that
uses selfing successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: In normal agriculture?
[SPEAKER_04]: In normal agriculture, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Selfing is a massively used technique with
great success.
[SPEAKER_04]: In cannabis, it seems to have negative
connotations taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe people have a different idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, at least, what it seems like
selfing, the biggest thing is because most
[SPEAKER_04]: of the things that we have are individual
cuts and not seed lines anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows you to see what else is in the
genetics besides that one expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had 100 seeds of what OG Kush came
out of, and it was males and females,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd have a line.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have a cut, then how do you see
what it is pure and not out-crossed?
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of times, Caleb talks all the
time, if people are looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: consistency in seed, then the way to go is
some of his out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of the feminized hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a lot of the feminized hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're looking for specific phenos,
but you're willing to tolerate more junk,
[SPEAKER_04]: go to the S1s.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the S1s are going to have a certain
amount of recessive stuff in there that's
[SPEAKER_04]: undesirable because it bred with itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the out-crosses, you know, Urkel
reversed onto Kush will be more consistent
[SPEAKER_04]: than Urkel onto Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why, again, when I talk about the
Blue Bonnet and despite what was said
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, that it was a pure blueberry
line, I still think to this day that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a hybrid because all those recessive
traits that blueberry usually carries when
[SPEAKER_02]: you further in-breed it are gone,
completely erased.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I talked before about how I didn't
like the pure blue lines very much at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you out-cross them to different
other amazing things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those kids came out way better than
the parent, in my opinion.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was massive in-breeding
going on in such a small environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: the constant crossing of two distinctly
different expressions, like crossing
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica to Sativa or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't breed like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They breed in this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't keep constantly
in-crossing two different types through
[SPEAKER_02]: generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that caused some weird in-breeding to
go on and not all the best traits to be
[SPEAKER_02]: apparent.
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ is really unusual, dude, because if you
believe him, what he says, he basically
[SPEAKER_04]: took four plants and never added anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything that he has comes from
those four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a Oregon purple tie and a
juicy fruit tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe something else, or that's it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oregon purple tie was chocolate tie,
Oaxacan gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Count those two.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you count those two, it's four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a lot of times, all those things
were only used once, according to him,
[SPEAKER_04]: never back-crossed two again or
reintroduced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just worked within the lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Kamara has talked about how he kind
of used all of DJ's stuff as this big
[SPEAKER_04]: mangled in-bred specific thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least that's cool because you never
mixed anything else into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's really unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything about how he made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent several thousand dollars on those
specific seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to really work to find things
that were good blueberry turps because
[SPEAKER_02]: that just wasn't what I was seeing in the
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you I ran 400 and 450 of four of
his lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wish I was bragging about keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wouldn't have Blue Bonnet without
those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's great potential in those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, like you said, it's in the
hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the hybridization.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like that thing with the
closest thing that we have to an actual
[SPEAKER_04]: IBM.
[SPEAKER_04]: People throw around IBL all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It drives about nine nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: IBL sucks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because an IBL is essentially something
that's been bred so consistently that it
[SPEAKER_04]: just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's looking like clones of each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything looks like clones of each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have some kind of ideal where
you're trying to grow fields of exact
[SPEAKER_04]: replicas, it might be a good tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to breed all of the genetic
diversity out of your shit and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: that you cross with it is going to look
like it, then fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that 88G13 hash plant kind of throws
phenos that are just like it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cross things with a deep chunk,
and it's very deep chunkish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Gene did point out that there are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I refer to IBLs, I do think a deep
chunk, because visually, it is very
[SPEAKER_02]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's two phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like two visually expressive phenos that
look distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you smoke it, some have a much
better high than the others.
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was speaking about it, I was only
speaking visually, when in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: a true IBL would be for all traits across
the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it drives Matt and I nuts,
because there are no IBLs in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so an IBL is basically something that
breeds true for all traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the seeds are going to be very
narrow within that tiny little band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have a true breeding strain that's
only true breeding for one trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the bonnet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true breeding for blueberry turps,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you could have something like skunk one
that's true breeding for improving calyx
[SPEAKER_04]: to leaf ratio or bud structure or this or
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has a variety of turps or things in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So true breeding, an IBL is like the
furthest example of true breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when all the characteristics are
the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And true breeding is just one or more of
the characteristics you can count on
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing in the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when someone the other day,
I can't recall who it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a lady, was saying that
they have an F2 IBL, and people were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that lady was like, no, it makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make sense to have an F2 IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a lot of terms that are
thrown around.
[SPEAKER_04]: IBL is the worst one because you should be
able to buy 100 seeds of an IBL and see
[SPEAKER_04]: less than 2% variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think where the miscommunication is,
is that a line being inbred is not the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing as an inbred line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And line breeding is not the same thing as
an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: IBL is so specific, and line breeding and
breeding in a line didn't denote an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a process to getting towards an IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's where a lot of
confusion lies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a bunch of variation of any
traits at all in your weed, it's not an
[SPEAKER_04]: IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: IBLs is basically a way in agriculture to
grow clones of each other from seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's its goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're going to grow an IBL for
weed, it's like you're going to breed all
[SPEAKER_04]: the cool shit out of it, and it's not
going to be worth breeding with once it's
[SPEAKER_04]: an IBL, for the most part, because it's
going to have such a narrow range.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to make everything look like
itself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you made an IBL, maybe it would
be just if it was something that was just
[SPEAKER_04]: so incredible, but it'd probably be a
bunch of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd probably be a bunch of work,
and it would suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Realistically speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in cannabis, another reason it's very
hard to make IBLs is because males express
[SPEAKER_02]: different than females, even if they are
the same expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they're the same general
phenotype, the male always grows taller
[SPEAKER_02]: than the female, so they don't look
identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to choose the male expression of
a female line that you want to find is
[SPEAKER_02]: very fucking hard to do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's much easier and faster
to do it through selfing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's an aspect, too, where someone
was like, well, what if you just picked a
[SPEAKER_04]: really good plant to IBL?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's assuming that all those traits will
be the dominant trait the more that you
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an aspect there where it's like
someone just said, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed whatever the question was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was trying to look for it just
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Matt, if you can find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing, there is no cubed term.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only motherfucker that ever used the
term cute, like the C99 really cubed,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was a Mr. Soul thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was sort of his own terminology for
repeated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even after this, he still has his
fucking trading wheels.
[SPEAKER_04]: He needs to slow down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there's no, cubing was just like
he found some bag seed and he started
[SPEAKER_04]: inbreeding it to itself, a bunch,
you know, which was already probably
[SPEAKER_04]: inbred.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not only lock in shitty traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, one of the reasons
why they don't want you to bang your
[SPEAKER_04]: sister is because the shit that happens to
you when you start breeding humans too
[SPEAKER_04]: close is a lot of mental issues,
physical issues, various kinds of things
[SPEAKER_04]: start popping up that in normal humans are
never dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you inbreed enough, you can combine
those two not dominant genes and it'll pop
[SPEAKER_04]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said what about this isn't a real
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about recombinant inbred line like
Tony Greenan's GG4RIL?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even answer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like without laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think that's a guy who is
talking shit about Caleb and said he was
[SPEAKER_02]: at like F12 or some fucking.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's there's there's an aspect where
it's like, let's let's let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like there's a lot of there's a lot
of terms that get loosely applied to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not that well understood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not anybody's fault because it's
not like there's seminars on this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of information gets passed
through friendships and a lot of times
[SPEAKER_04]: some of those friendships like aren't
passing the most reliable information
[SPEAKER_04]: about things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people don't know what the term
means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like they've done work if
they put stupid ass terms at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: F12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you really think that some dude
that's been around not that long is it
[SPEAKER_02]: F12, then you do not understand breeding
or how long it takes to make it through
[SPEAKER_02]: generations and to do real breeding to
make sure that generations correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've made an error to go back to
the previous generation, keep working
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're never going to hit it right
12 times in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So implying that he has worked something
like 12 generations is asinine to people
[SPEAKER_02]: who actually do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's friends of ours that are
breeders that are like, dude, I had this
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome line and then I did this thing to
it and I didn't end up keeping enough seed
[SPEAKER_04]: from before I did that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just get rid of to get rid of that seed
and go one to two gens back and go in a
[SPEAKER_04]: different direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't keep the seed and I fucked it
up and it's not as good as it was before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't make it the way it was before
because I didn't keep that gen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically like a misstep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make a misstep if you don't save
if you don't save seed from every single
[SPEAKER_04]: rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and when people say F2,
F3, F4, I mean, what that means is that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're supposed to grow a bunch of seed,
pick males and females that exhibit traits
[SPEAKER_04]: that you want, cross them and then breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, here's a question and I'm going to
address it just because me and me and CSI
[SPEAKER_02]: were talking about like an hour ago or
before we started this anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is crossing an elite to an elite
breeding or pollen chucking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider regular breeding like using a
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider that vacation and taking days
off like that is the easiest shit to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just they they make their seeds
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have you might have to shake it
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding using reversal techniques is a
lot more involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's a lot more unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a lot more errors,
a lot real fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could you could take something
and isolate it and make it more true
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can also make huge errors right
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very rarely does a pollination go
where you can just like get something and
[SPEAKER_02]: shake it in a reversal and the seeds make
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really happen that often.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times you have to get in there
with fucking tweezers, tweeze out each
[SPEAKER_02]: one, shake the fucking pollen out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of that shit won't be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just because that's that's how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an aspect to which I should
mention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the reason why Matt said you're
not going to 12 12 readings that all make
[SPEAKER_04]: sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what he means by that is that let's
say you're at F3 and you grow up a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of F3s and you're ready to make your F4s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you realize that you don't like
that combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to go back one generation
earlier and try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you didn't like that selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're like in order to get to F12.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means 12 times you would have to grow
up seeds like what you see, pick females
[SPEAKER_04]: and males of each one, cross them
together, grow up their children and just
[SPEAKER_04]: keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every single time, every single F gen,
you're like, fuck yeah, I won.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fuck yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get somewhere and be like,
oh, that went in the direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like that nearly as much as the
F4.
[SPEAKER_04]: This F5 sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to go back to F4 again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a green crack BX1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I was one of the early
growers and breeders with green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just nice and mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really beautiful purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sucker for purples.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the BX1, I crossed it to and
actually I've done a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one that I ran with was the
Platinum Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the male from it and out crossed to
that back to the green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I found was a lot of Platinum
Banana OG plants and not many green
[SPEAKER_02]: cracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't expect that because usually
green crack breeds dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was one of those cases where it's
like, okay, even though it's a BX1 and it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like it should be super green
cracky, that's not how it played out in
[SPEAKER_02]: practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only in theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of was an epic fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is why breeding is such a bitch
because you spend all this time in energy
[SPEAKER_04]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, oh, I don't like
that, that choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back, go back, you know, slide back
down and start over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a lot of missteps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of things that you hope
will happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm going to take this and cross it
to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hoping these traits come together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, oh, that's a
horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why so many people just like to
make one one off outcrosses to different
[SPEAKER_04]: things, not testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can test it and just release
it and just move on to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can spend a bunch of time
dicking around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there was there's an aspect where
Bodhi was telling me when when he first
[SPEAKER_04]: got the 88G13 hash plant, right,
from NDN guy seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't realize that they were already
F4.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he kept the first he kept males and
females of the first round.
[SPEAKER_04]: And didn't lose them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then he took it three more gens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got shittier and shittier every
gen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what he ended up using was the very
first seeds that he popped from the
[SPEAKER_04]: initial seeds that he got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what and that's what's in all
those hybrids that people buy from him is
[SPEAKER_04]: because those those moms and dads made way
better crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Than any of the intentional work he did
after because he thought he was getting it
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of raw.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's like, oh, open pollinated a couple
of times and all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you know, and he spent all this
time three doing going three gens.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a lot of time, a lot of effort is
not rewarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, and then he's like,
each one of these gens sucks ass and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm just going to stick with this
first shit I have over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I could have saved myself a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can guarantee you, after being in
this business this long, that what's
[SPEAKER_02]: what's sad and what a lot of people have
noticed that that are in this business is
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're the how quickly things sell
it, how much work you put into it has no
[SPEAKER_02]: reliance on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in the hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no real reward to putting in
all that extra work to then fail and spend
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of money doing it or to then succeed
and still not be able to outsell something
[SPEAKER_02]: else that's being hyped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people when people make comments
about like, I don't see readers doing long
[SPEAKER_02]: work anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason it's just not financially
viable anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as bad as it sucks to hear that,
as bad as it sucks to say it, that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why most readers, if you were
to ask them, like, you know, to like
[SPEAKER_04]: people breed and they put in a bunch of
crosses and then they make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not dissing it by any means,
but I'm just saying that they don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: time to test every round of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't anymore before release.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not it's not it's not
feasible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can you might look through
the things that you're the most interested
[SPEAKER_04]: in always.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, and see and be like,
oh, I really want to see what's in this
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even that is the minimum I can
think of, like seven people that do even
[SPEAKER_02]: that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's an aspect where,
you know, I mean, Matt and I, when we were
[SPEAKER_04]: researching, like, I guess you'd call it
last season's podcast that we were doing
[SPEAKER_04]: and we were doing a bunch of nevel work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could go through the Sensi catalog
from 91 to 95 and it barely changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barely at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just little tiny things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barely changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some some names here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One or two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe in five years, they added three
or four things to the catalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like people come out with 20
or 25 new strains every crop every time
[SPEAKER_04]: they make make a drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when they make another drop six
months later, it's a totally different set
[SPEAKER_04]: of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's become vastly different.
[SPEAKER_04]: People used to be able to get away with
Simon from serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: For 20 years, he sold six things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That don't work no more.
[SPEAKER_04]: White Russian, Chronic, AK, Kali Mist,
Bubblegum, and one more.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more than I'm forgetting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, he sold he sold six lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he made those six lines over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said AK, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we could look it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe I think it was six.
[SPEAKER_04]: I named five off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was six, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was six.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, 15 years of just making,
I'm going to make these same hybrids
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm going to make them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, they didn't have to
change that much since he's catalog.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first five or six years was pretty
consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last three or four years in
the 90s, they added four, five or six more
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it stayed consistent after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like, that's not what
breeders or growers or anyone expects.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be all new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even with me early on,
I would like to do the Clockwork Orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd always keep that in stock and like the
White Russian big ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I said White Russian.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it kept it in stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the years, you realize that's not
even viable to do anymore because people
[SPEAKER_02]: want new and now and new and now at all
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not everyone, obviously, but the
majority of the seed people buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't do that, you it's not a
viable company anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Matt and I laugh because we read
all this stuff about what people think
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders act most.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of breeders are actually doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Versus what they actually do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh, these guys are
testing this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're looking for herms and they're
looking for this and they're doing this
[SPEAKER_04]: and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're making choices and selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not most of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the most profitable way right now
to make seeds is just to like blow off a
[SPEAKER_04]: room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know, collect the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's even worse than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the most profitable way to make
seeds like compound and guys like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: they buy seeds from other people already
made and label them something they're
[SPEAKER_02]: hiking.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of stuff that goes on with
like people would be shocked to know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, how many how many of their like
some of their favorite Cali people got
[SPEAKER_04]: their seeds made in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, or had some dude that they know
that has a tent, make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And act like they're blowing up their
facilities.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a lot of there's a lot of
fakery there, you know, and people eat it
[SPEAKER_04]: up and they've realized that they with IG
and what these things they can control the
[SPEAKER_04]: narrative and hype and people never see
behind the screen door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the amount that they think that
they're yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most aren't even germ testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most aren't even taking 100 or 200 seeds
and spending two or three days and making
[SPEAKER_04]: sure they get a good pop rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what fucks candy rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't pop, you know, and he sold
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold them for like 800 bucks a piece
or 800 bucks a pack or something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but so there's all these things that
they think their breeders are like these
[SPEAKER_04]: mad scientists, like really putting in the
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most and that's how they present
themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the people that do put in work
and but don't show it that much for
[SPEAKER_04]: various reasons, they get called out for
being the big guys that aren't doing the
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, dude, you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero is like paying some kids to do the
work while doing photo ops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, while ordering half of it from Dina
Femme in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think he's been carefully working
on it for the past 12, 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and he's just putting his name
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally a relabel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and and there's not a lot of
pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's just and so what Matt was
basically saying is that there's not
[SPEAKER_04]: incentive or financial survival for most
people to do what the customer base would
[SPEAKER_04]: like them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it used to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of us would rather just
quit and join the stupid shit parade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, think about it for a minute,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about how many people out there can
do what our buddy CSI does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is show pictures of rooms regularly
of what was running and show pictures of
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds that he made, that there's 200
phenos growing in a room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and you can go years and years
and years back of he hasn't he hasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: popped everything he's made.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's constantly popping stuff that
he's made and looking through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of dedication is like Uber
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like him and a few other
and you know, a few other people and some
[SPEAKER_04]: hobbyists who are doing it for love.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the famous people know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, definitely not because it's just not
financially feasible and they don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: the space and they don't really have any
goals either.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to just make much money off
a seed drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Caleb, Caleb, I can guarantee you
will spend every dime doing it right
[SPEAKER_02]: because he's so OCD and autistic about how
he gets it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's very admirable.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also his favorite part of the whole
process is seeing what's in the hybrids he
[SPEAKER_04]: makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually the part that keeps him
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of it is kind of a soul drenching
grind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that he gets excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never met a man more excited about
genetics and seeds than that man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fucking awesome because he's one
of the him and not so and a few of our
[SPEAKER_02]: other friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the only people that I've ever
met that I can sit there and nerd out with
[SPEAKER_02]: like that and dork out for hours on the
phone and just talk about genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and our wives all hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I actually have a buddy who just
mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's I have a buddy who's like as old of a
seed weird breeder interested in the
[SPEAKER_04]: process as you'd ever meet.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are people scattered throughout
Mendo and Humboldt here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've never been a majority anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's definitely a weird offshoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to have I want to have Uranus
come on sometime and talk to you because I
[SPEAKER_02]: know he's a big fucking nerd like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: He he is, you know, so a bunch of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like even fucking Caleb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like there's people that aren't
comfortable talking in public as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a hard thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do believe, you know, because
you're live like in person just sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: around with a couple buddies smoking
joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: And shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could capture that, it's amazingly
conversational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the party is like even even for me to
sit back and watch everyone like talk
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like like even some of the people
like everybody that was involved with O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush except for Big Ricky was at one of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like everybody but him was
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can listen to all of them talk all
at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people should know the guy that's
famous for Irene Rudeboy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he came out with this whole crew
one night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and brought his herb and we had our
you know, we sat around and we saw we shot
[SPEAKER_04]: the shit, you know, and exchanged a bunch
of stories and, you know, confirmed a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of things and, you know,
so yeah, not so does not need to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: mustache.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I mean, the thing is about
mustaches, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, this this is no prejudice whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 46.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was in my 20s and 30s, I would say
the only people that had mustaches were
[SPEAKER_04]: like police, firemen and gays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was no dudes just now it's
back in style and there's a bunch of like
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 somethings or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just rocking massive 70 stashes and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was like it went out of style like
the station wagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looks like he literally looks like
a Tom of Finland character when he has the
[SPEAKER_02]: full staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, do Superdog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do Superdog before we're done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Superdog.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, we are getting close to being done,
but I will people, but we're bugging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will give a brief synopsis of
Superdog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt sent me some stuff that like blew my
head off about Superdog in some forum
[SPEAKER_04]: posts and stuff like that that we won't
get into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But needless to say, I think what happened
is is that there's a there's a few
[SPEAKER_04]: versions and there's a few things that
happened over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my buddy, who I never mentioned,
I just call him Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mostly it's a it's a it's a bunch of
it's it's a bunch of his story,
[SPEAKER_04]: really.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you know, the story starts,
I guess, with he gave the super skunk to a
[SPEAKER_04]: chem dog to Greg.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in ninety three ish, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ninety four ish, Greg calls him up and
he's super excited because the super skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: had permed onto the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he got a bunch of seed and he grew
this seed up and he said, this seed is so
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing this stuff instead of the chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there was this aspect where get
where my buddy Staten Island thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, maybe we could blend these two things
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we didn't know shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't know shit about STS or reversals
or anything like that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so pre pre that it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Homie, three thousand miles away,
just had an accident and got some seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so homie out here thought,
oh, maybe I'll have an accident.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he basically started the project and
he took a Hawaiian plant and crossed it to
[SPEAKER_04]: the super skunk hut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he got he got like a super skunk
line for for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bred that a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he took a he took some males of
that and tossed it on the we tossed it on
[SPEAKER_04]: the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the super dog was born.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was helping him a little bit in the
middle of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then him and I worked together on
hunting through a bunch of super dog
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And doing further outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was some stuff on the East Coast
that might have had a similar name that
[SPEAKER_04]: came about in a very different fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell I'm going to tell one
real quick story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was obsessed with finding that
super dog cut because I was a big fan of
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel and supposedly they were similar
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was chem 91 super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly one was supposedly Chem D super
skunk, according to the Canna Bible at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had already had diesel and I loved
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the super dog really interests me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't sure if maybe they got it
wrong and it's the same cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remember asking Greg back then chem
dog about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of inferred that he had bred
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw another post today where he
again inferred he bred it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that it was the same genetics
as your guys's out in the West Coast and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still no pictures, no provenance,
nothing for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I asked for any info about
it, all I get and with diesel as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: all still all I get is let me check my
notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to do a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like chem dog a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've met his wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's that's as far as I can
get with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think in my opinion, I think they
didn't know much about super dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: They heard about it and that he may have
taken credit for it back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was probably what was going on with
Gabby and you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so we did a bunch of work on it and it
took us a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's like there's a lot of
projects like that where when you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have some specific goal in terms of like
timing or anything, it's like we popped
[SPEAKER_04]: off a rip here and then four months later,
six months later, we did another stage of
[SPEAKER_04]: it over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, it's kind of like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing it along while you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we ended up what happened is what most
people what most people know of is we
[SPEAKER_04]: started picking phenos like the seven,
the three, the 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some pictures of it in the Canna
Bible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I started spreading it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started giving out selected cuttings to
friends and we crossed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a time when we did, you know,
we were trying to do I don't know what you
[SPEAKER_04]: call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not quite open pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, but we basically took out of out of
hundreds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We took like our four or five favorite
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Combined with about seven or eight of our
favorite females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we put them in a room and we bloomed
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we threw in literally every good
cutting that we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actual Chem 91, actual super skunk,
the warlock, my black domino.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a cut, the Maui, the Mendo perps,
the creepy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the creepy.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, we didn't have this was before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have a kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't have a kush quite yet or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but we so we did basically just like
it was like bred amongst itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we bred it to like every fire cut
we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my gosh.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one totally distracted me,
but I.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that herbalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did do that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the what I call the Skunk Spring
Cam line, and that's the only other one
[SPEAKER_02]: besides the early Afghani line that I
consistently can can make skunky shit come
[SPEAKER_02]: out of really easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, you know, he doesn't really
like to chat in public or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but he probably my buddy from Staten
Island is probably should get the most
[SPEAKER_04]: credit for the superdog because he put the
most time into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Him and I did do projects with it
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was the projects that him and
I were doing together that ended up
[SPEAKER_04]: getting spread out and getting
photographed and getting traded to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of I think where it
started popping up on the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people started talking about it and
seeing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave a bunch of superdog hybrids to
Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of the basis of the males
that he started with his emerald emerald
[SPEAKER_04]: mountain seed company and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so it started it got it got mixed into
some other things that are pretty famous,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we won't go into that right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was what we were trying to do is we
were trying to get the density and the
[SPEAKER_04]: potency of the camp 91 combined with the
the color and the crystal content and the
[SPEAKER_04]: nose of the skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted potency and density from over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wanted a little bit better looks
and frost and turps from over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it worked pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and honestly, it probably would
have it probably would have taken off a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch more if the purple and then Kush and
diesel craze hadn't started where everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to grow the exact same strains to
get the dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yes, the superdog would have
been in in disposed in 2001 in the Bay 100
[SPEAKER_04]: percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would definitely be an era that there
would definitely be an era where you could
[SPEAKER_04]: have gotten a lot of superdog went to the
Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole bunch, you know, and, you know,
you know, I've talked before about how we
[SPEAKER_04]: lost it and some of the different things
and been hunting for it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It, you know, it exists in a bunch of
children and, you know, skunk and chem
[SPEAKER_04]: seem to be a great combo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, I know, I know that at least
in 2011 or 12 that Maui superdog was still
[SPEAKER_02]: being grown up north.
[SPEAKER_02]: That weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you know Karnak,
the weirdo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's there's Finos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends from Trinity County that
grew for years and their boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: His favorite strain was a Maui superdog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a Maui superdog hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some of the Maui superdog
Mandelbrot wrote about it a bunch,
[SPEAKER_04]: but he found out of seeds that I gave him
something he ended up calling the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was Maui by superdog.
[SPEAKER_04]: That just a straight Maui by superdog.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think better is still holding that
cut for you, too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's there's a number there's a
number of Finos of that that float around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some other stuff we won't get
into right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's a whole nother movie where
it's in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's it's it's blended into different
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's one of those gigs where it's like
weed reinvents itself every five or 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people only like to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy and popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would probably knock people's socks
off today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it came out at a time when it wasn't
able to get as famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because it was coming out in
2000, 2001, 2002, 2003.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just that was like a
different era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things didn't get like naturally hiked
very easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it just couldn't spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People couldn't communicate as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clones didn't spread as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't clone trading going on very
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't clone mailing, anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so so there's an aspect to that
that someone's asking if you what did you
[SPEAKER_02]: all find out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find a line on anything that you
thought was lost recently?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so that I thought was lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I there's you know, we did get
something that I consider to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: Trinity, or at least, you know,
extremely, extremely close to the right
[SPEAKER_04]: cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and we that was lost for 15 or
18 years to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still not sure if it's the exact
right thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's even the people that seem to
think it might be not think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: incredibly closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an S1 or, you know, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's the real one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now what gets hard is that because old
things are becoming popular again,
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone's coming out of the woodwork with
old things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that goes back to the fucking
question that dude had about a smear
[SPEAKER_02]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely consider diesel chem skunk
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, diesel and sour diesel and all that
is is chem is is chem skunk blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we close it down, I want
someone wants you to talk about Francine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kept they kept mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Francine was an extremely tasty indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, that's the that's the cut
that facilitated the the trade for the
[SPEAKER_04]: super skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my buddy ended up we ended up letting
it go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like a lot of amazing Afghans,
it had horrific rot issues.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could it could grow all these big,
beautiful colas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there'd be gray rot running up
the center stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people had fine had had
issues with breeding a lot of early
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Afghans bred in rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they grew up in a in a dry,
cold Afghan environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they get brought to like moderate
sort of humid California at times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just they just couldn't handle
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was it's one of those things where
it's part of the lore, but it was
[SPEAKER_04]: intentionally dropped for issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was dropped long before any of us
thought that any of this weed that we were
[SPEAKER_04]: growing would matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sure too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so yeah, I mean, we've now been talking
two hours and six minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's probably we try to keep it two
hours every Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe now it's a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Matt, if you want to do any plugs or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to Google, type in radio syndicate,

[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably a it's probably a two or
three part show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, at least at least it needs props
and pictures, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just in general, in general,
two or three parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, two or three parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
