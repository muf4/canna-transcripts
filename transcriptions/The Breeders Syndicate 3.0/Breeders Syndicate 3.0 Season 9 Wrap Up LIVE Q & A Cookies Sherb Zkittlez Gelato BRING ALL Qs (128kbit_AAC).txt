[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_03]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_03]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_03]: seat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_03]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Syndicate is a collection of seed makers
that want to push back against all the
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_03]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put us on.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess we're going to find out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says we're alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we are live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I'm checking the stream,
we are not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, we're not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says waiting for us.
Wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a delay.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Thousandfold and Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I hearing myself in the background?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you probably got the the actual
YouTube thing open.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just mute it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to mute it, but it wouldn't mute.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to look at the YouTube
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the comments in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, today we're going to do
questions, questions and answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to shoot the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of cover, I guess, what season one
through season nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions people have?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try to cover it as best I
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the people we have here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So start tossing in your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thousand, you got anything you want to
throw in from the beginning?
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the people who are doing this
already.
[SPEAKER_07]: But can I get everyone in the live chat to
tell us where you are writing from?
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be general as you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be your country.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be your region.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Baltimore is the home of the wire.
Baltimore.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people do we have?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_07]: 73.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me post.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make an announcement to the server.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Newcastle, Washington.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: New York, SoCal, Long Beach, Sin City,
Upstate New York, South Dakota,
[SPEAKER_03]: H-Townside Houston, the dirty South
Minnesota, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Philly, Virginia, Pennsylvania,
Toronto, Homer, Alaska, Tennessee,
[SPEAKER_03]: Chi-Town.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is quite a festival of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Montana, Alabama, Maryland.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one from Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two people from Australia.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just like you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, your people.
[SPEAKER_07]: British Unite.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just start shooting in any
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're here for, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one to start us off, Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked you the same question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you wanted to know what they were
and maybe what your general feelings were
[SPEAKER_07]: about some of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You gave me the King Louie one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me about that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the Louie cut that Rezin had
that he kept all those years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's just like typical what I
would consider OG Kush, Southern
[SPEAKER_03]: California OG Kush, as we knew it in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that Louie is a good
representation of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think like the same cut got passed as
SFV, as Larry, as Tahoe, as all kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just depending on where you were at.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the Louie cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, when I grow it,
it's really, it's more of the soapy,
[SPEAKER_03]: less sweet, piney, soapy piney territory
or furniture polish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Furniture polish, piney.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that one like super golf ball
structure or did it stack up really well?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it's super golf ball for me,
especially that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, I think it can be grown in
certain like tables and environments where
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get it to stack hard, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just never grew it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always growing in cocoa pots,
drained away on the floor as big as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's see, there was a master list I
had the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember who asked me all the OG
bonnet crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that you, Thousand?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't keep those.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you just wouldn't stop for like
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yeah, like five of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to, I'm going to see if I can
name them.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the SFV bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Louie bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the Earline bonnet, which is the
fake Irene, blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fake Irene came from Cecil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some kind of Bubba OG hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we have in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Kush, the 92 OG, which a lot of people
confuse for the same cut, but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: totally different growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Lumpus headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Motor Breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had, or Motor Breath 15 specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some more in there, isn't there?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like 12 and I'm only up to seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: So did you say Soul Assassin?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Triangle, Soul Assassin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some more.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few more in there and I just
can't remember them all off the top of my
[SPEAKER_03]: head.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the main reason I did it was
because I had, what's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: The resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was the Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main reason I did all those was
because it was one of the first times I
[SPEAKER_03]: had had that many OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and the Pure Kush too, to make it,
to Vangie Canyon Pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you count the Bubbas, which is the
Katsu, Shaw's Bubbit in the pre-98,
[SPEAKER_03]: which Shaw's in the pre-98, I'm pretty
sure the same exact cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Denali said, nice try.
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost got him to come into chat,
sneak him in without him knowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, like the reason I did it was
because I had all the cuts at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: time and I wanted to see how each bread
did the bonnet, especially because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: learning how the bonnet bread at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main differences are going to be like
the Lumpus headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: That does take a more big cola,
almost a sour-like structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there was the, did I do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 56 day headband, that was in there
too, which is another OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: The triangle Giesel, blue bonnet was also
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was just too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did too many, but a lot of them are very
similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to run into similar
expressions from all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, some OGs are just very
different, like the Lumpus headband,
[SPEAKER_03]: the triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people get your triangle and hear
that it's a mom of OG, they'll grow the
[SPEAKER_03]: cut and get a hold of the cut and they'll
be like, damn, this is not what I was
[SPEAKER_03]: expecting for OG because it's like
fucking, for its time, it's kind of midsy,
[SPEAKER_03]: earthy compared to like the very terpy
Kush cut, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people are expecting that
terpy pine-sol stuff when they get
[SPEAKER_03]: triangle, it's just not that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the triangle stuff will definitely take
it in a different direction than the soapy
[SPEAKER_03]: pine-sol stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more earthy, cushy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to explain, but yeah,
it's not what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I cover more of that or less?
[SPEAKER_07]: We have so many questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we take a break.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to, okay, here's a breeding
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you decide which female to reverse
when making feminized seeds with two
[SPEAKER_07]: different females?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't make seeds with two different
females.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't make feminized seeds with two
different females at the same time.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he means like, if you want to do like
a headband to an OG and they're both clone
[SPEAKER_08]: only, how do you decide which one you want
to feminize onto the other?
[SPEAKER_08]: And my answer in short would be you try
and reverse both of them, whichever is
[SPEAKER_08]: better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you can get seed off of doing both
of them and compare, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's always more data, more- It's a
similar question to people asking like,
[SPEAKER_07]: what do males pass versus females?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there isn't really like- Yeah,
a lot of people, when they ask about
[SPEAKER_03]: reversals, they have this thing in their
head where they think, one, if you reverse
[SPEAKER_03]: it, it's going to be the dominant partner
in the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all kinds of, and there's just
no set answer to any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if people are giving you set answers,
then they're just bullshitting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, let's say, I'm going to do a
reversal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say blueberry, random
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have two different Bubba cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say a Katsu Bubba and the pre-98
Shaw's Bubba, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Katsu's Bubba is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows more asymmetrical type bud
structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much more purple passing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get a lot more coffee earthy from
the Katsu than I do the typical Bubba,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I can pull soapy, all kinds of stuff
from it, cushy soapy stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I would choose one over the
other is one possible reverse is well and
[SPEAKER_03]: drops like pollen and we have more
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I want the traits more from the Katsu
Bubba versus the pre-98.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just knowing your clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't reverse any clones that you don't
know essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you don't know about the clone in
the first place, it's not going to do any
[SPEAKER_03]: good to reverse it and hit it to something
unless you're just playing, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're not breeding because you don't
even know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know what traits are going to
pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no predictive measures.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no anything but playing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've actually had the pleasure of
doing both sides of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're like, I'm trying to remember the
specific example.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had to be something with Skittles,
you know, where I like cross Skittles to
[SPEAKER_08]: something and then cross that to reverse
the other parent onto the Skittles,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are very different.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Skittles, probably not the best
example on that front, but like I've seen
[SPEAKER_08]: it to where you get like they're usually
in the same ballpark, but you I've liked
[SPEAKER_08]: one better than the other before,
you know, and like, or like one will have
[SPEAKER_08]: a higher prevalence of herms, something
like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Bubba examples.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just laughing to myself because I'm
like, well, Bubba dumps if you just spit
[SPEAKER_08]: on it and like call it a bad girl,
you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: that plan I've never had any trouble with,
but I didn't know the like expressional
[SPEAKER_08]: differences.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never like had, mine have always just
been Bubba when I've had them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I didn't know the, the coffee side
of things was more leaning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do the Katsu.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to, I need to get me a cut of that
Katsu now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if anybody kept it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it around.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got 98 back, but it was kind of,
you know, me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I passed it to anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody, cause I passed all our OGs to
Bitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he got some Bubba's via someone
else I gave him to, but I don't think the
[SPEAKER_03]: Katsu made it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really wanted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly because dudes are fucking Dippy do
whose names attached to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those things like you don't want to
co-sign someone who kind of sucks,
[SPEAKER_08]: but yeah, those, those really rich coffee
expressions though, were like some of my
[SPEAKER_08]: favorite old school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love Bubba period.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the high, I like everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whenever I grow pre 98, I kind of get more
of like a fruity soapy thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, and I don't really get much color
and I like the color on that more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Purple cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the one that would, they would
both float around in Arcata when I was
[SPEAKER_08]: living up there, but the, the pre 98 and
the green, more green expressions was more
[SPEAKER_08]: common.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, but you can finish your thought,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, but Katsu is probably a hybrid of
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know with what, and I doubt
Katsu has any clue or Oregon kid,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe white rhino.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you would ask Oregon kid would probably
be his first bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just one of those things where
like, if I were choosing to breed with one
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba over the other, I would take that
into consideration too, knowing it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid and get a breed that there's
potential to breed away from Bubba,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if that's what's in that one
dude's coffee line with a K.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Kaia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kaia's coffee.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like a star fight or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a question for Farma Dan from
Buckshot from a bit ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says what?
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of strawberry banana do you
have?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the Crockett cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, I'm not sure if it was their
original selected clone, but they recently
[SPEAKER_08]: got it back in clone form.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw it on their IG and it's like the
spitting image of the exact clone that I
[SPEAKER_08]: recently received.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it at least gives me some tier of
like, well, I mean, like if it's something
[SPEAKER_08]: that they're going to end up working with,
it probably at least has those hash and
[SPEAKER_08]: rosin qualities that that line is kind of
known for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's the reason I took it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was from a, God, I actually don't know
where that came from.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think one of the, one of the people I
work with came back from an event with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: One for Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, you two, you see the,
our comments, the chat thing, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually favorite comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you see questions that you like,
there's a star in the top, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tap.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't, that doesn't like tag them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just shows it for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just pulled up a little tech stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So real quick, Kai's coffee is the alien
OG alien Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's two swerve lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are those swerve?
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought those were, those were odds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just to pay the alien Kush F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be swerve is going to be,
uh, I mean, in fairness of, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the original alien who is not the
alien selling seeds right now are two to
[SPEAKER_03]: different people like, and OBS was
responsible for the alien tech and
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing that to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never really passed it, but there were
people popping up pretending they had the
[SPEAKER_03]: alien tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, I, I would probably say OBS has
more to do with alien tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would avoid any swerve, anything
that comes to me and I'd avoid swerve at
[SPEAKER_03]: all costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a pin devil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've found, I've found his stuff more than
I care to admit in the work that people in
[SPEAKER_08]: my position.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the same company were before me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like look through the documentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, Oh, that's, that's a swerve
line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, Oh, that's another bullshit
artists.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, Oh yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good thing about him though,
as you know, that he probably bought those
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds in bulk from a hopefully respectable
person and just relabeled them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully it was still good,
regardless, you know, I met a dude who,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, uh, where I think it was in LA who
told me that he used to work for him as a
[SPEAKER_08]: packager.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, if we ran out of something
and it was selling hot and he's like,
[SPEAKER_08]: we'd throw anything in those vials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just like, Oh, yeah, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I definitely bought a bunch of his
shit when I was like newer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome local by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, local.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_08]: I added him in, totally forgot.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are those sour Skittles hidden?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't hear him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't hear him yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we had a question for Matt from
Screwston.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is Matt most excited about seeing in
the dark blue dream reversal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me find the reversal list.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me find the list so I can read it off
real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, he's done some killer stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about upfront what he wanted to
put in and, uh, what he was going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thankfully I got some eyes in on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, I would say that my, the one that
I am most curious about is the,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, soul assassin cut one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see how he did with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, uh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have old Betsy green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So assassin one OG, the P 91 S one from
bitter, um, uh, the blue garlic,
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim D the pure Kush shoreline dog shit
Appalachia Bay dream, which I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't originally called that,
but it is Appalachia Bay dream and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, uh, arcade, a train wreck to the blue
dream, which is reversed from the blue
[SPEAKER_03]: dream to the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some blue dream S ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I I'm stoked to see old Betsy green
crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already seen what green crack and
blue dream look like combined,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't remember doing blue dream on
to green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did green crack on a blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really stoked to see those,
uh, the P 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm partial because I love those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, there's a ton of shit here at
the soul assassin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Though I know that's one of his,
he's real stoked about
[SPEAKER_00]: what else do we got here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to put any questions in caps
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it easier for me to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have an old pack of OG or Kush S
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude traded me off IC mag back in 07.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an old pack of regs of the OG or
Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see what we could do with those
next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if they're still poppable,
we will see.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we feel about 2020 Mendo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what else do we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba sour M 10, um, Dr. Blaze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never heard of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Mary kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I'm always down to do fuck Mary kill
on any three people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys throw up three people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll happily do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure that I'm going to start
thinking on that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will not be stoked to have me answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll be happy to answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to give you any good ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I grow outdoor this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the creamy punch and,
uh, ABC stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you see in those creamy punch,
man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, dude, cause I don't know anything
about that cream cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's different than the cream cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cream line we had was the silver is
silver pearl blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it's essentially like silver
pearl looking plants with blueberry mixed
[SPEAKER_03]: with silver pearl turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's one of my favorite out of all
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the creamy punch is that cross to,
um, punchy bluster, which is the banana
[SPEAKER_03]: punch blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I would be seeing a lot of
great sweet tarts, a lot of, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe some berry poking through,
but because purple punch is so dominant,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the silver pearl also dominates
heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really wasn't sure which way it was
going to go, but they all seem to be some
[SPEAKER_03]: version of the silver pearl with very
great smarties, like just down the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all tend to be very resinous,
like the silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they do tend to be leafy outdoor,
but I just haven't grown enough indoor to
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suck it outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of hard to judge on outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just something to run.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think hippie was trying to bait you into
talking about your outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, what did, what did Matt grow
outdoors this year?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an outdoor grow now, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just remember, Matt is now an outdoor
grower.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you do pots or in the ground?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, pots, little tiny ones, like a fucking
dummy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: To go in the ground, you'll like,
it'll be night and day, bro, especially
[SPEAKER_08]: with how hot it is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to do outdoor indoor or
indoor outdoor, um, feeding with bottles
[SPEAKER_03]: and pots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, if you're on the coast and in that
fog band or like just outside it,
[SPEAKER_08]: that shit is like in some ways the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you're, you know,
hunting, you know, and, um, but it's just
[SPEAKER_08]: when it's hot, like even like where I'm
at, cause I'm just like North,
[SPEAKER_08]: but kind of the same like band away from
the coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's just so hard to get away with
anything smaller than like a 35 to 50
[SPEAKER_08]: gallon pot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, mango puff from gauge worth running.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys are fucking trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always going to be trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, bring back the fruit loops.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't called fruit loops.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called tricks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it was kind of weird when,
when I was given those seeds originally by
[SPEAKER_03]: motor rebel, the, um, Colombian gold,
it was Kim D crossed to Columbia gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when motor rebel gave me those,
it was like, Oh nine, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't know who made them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came from Moda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was running them and they were
really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were obviously half Colombian gold,
half Kim D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was a worked Colombian line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm guessing the farmer's choice
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've grown those and it was very
similar to Terps and, and flowering time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, most of them were around 11 to 14
weeks, which was short for a Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, that brought me to a worked
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Lupa later took credit for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just kind of assumed it was his,
but I just never know with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I, I don't know if any of those
seeds still pop anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who's running it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Denali ran it for a long time too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might still have one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I genuinely don't know, but who knows what
else we got?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've started a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Indo wanted to know about the ABC
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, you know, it's only in the F one
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with ABC or stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually growing subterfuge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate giving that guy any credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he's an asshole, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a subterfuge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was growing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pollinated it with creamy punch,
but in the F ones, you're not going to see
[SPEAKER_03]: any ABC type traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's nothing going to be done with
this first round.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to pass them out to some
people if they wanted to run them,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to see what it looks like,
but there's not going to be any of the ABC
[SPEAKER_03]: trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably be like trepidoline,
creepy punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested to take my own shot at
breeding away from those.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's obvious trepidoline only terps
from, uh, ABC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what can you tell me about Afghani
cure?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be a good choice to work some CBD
into a line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but it's only, again, it's only an F
one CBD is a breeding trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it needs to be taken further,
tested, uh, lock in the CBD trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, take it to F four.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you lock in CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's, it's a great place to
start.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's going to be skunky CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard to beat that, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, someone asked this, and I think I've
asked you this before as well,
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt, someone asked whether or not you've
done Urkel bonnet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you were- No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, um, Urkel tray dog bonnet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was the poodle nuts, AKA dog waltz
from Highland Lonesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the closest I got, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the Durbin poison cut all over Colorado
and Cali the Sandy Weinstein cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody can link anything back to
Weinstein.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody can link anything back to
Weinstein.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got my first Durbin cut and it's
not like anything anyone has described it
[SPEAKER_08]: to me as.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, I don't know what the fuck
this is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to send you some pics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd be interested.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's very terpenaline, but like more
Jack terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it might be just Durbin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like a, it's got great resin
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like Durbin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, kind of like odd, like a
asymmetric, or like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, like a non-symmetrical weird
bud shapes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it could be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll send you some, I'll have to take some
pics on like Monday or something and I'll
[SPEAKER_08]: send them to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone asked.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was going to say there was one guy
that, uh, that asked if S1 seeds are
[SPEAKER_08]: better than F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I was just going to too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you answer that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go for that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, I literally have a picture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I can post it on the, the water
cooler, like the general chat on the
[SPEAKER_08]: discord where it's a S1 hybrid side by
side with one of my like male,
[SPEAKER_08]: female, uh, F1s.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the vigor is between like,
it's like, it goes down a step.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like an F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got this nice, beautiful, vigorous
seedling.
[SPEAKER_08]: The, um, feminized hybrid.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing, but like three
quarter size.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you see the S1 of like an OG
specifically.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is the dwarfiest little fuck of all
time growing so slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, even though they were fully
developed seeds, like terrible germ rate,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, you know, like 50%.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, um, yeah, no F1s of regular male
females are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like S1s like anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's different tools for different
purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want something to read more direct
and, and narrow, then yeah, an S1
[SPEAKER_03]: selection would be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, I mean, just there are two
different things, completely different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe, uh, unlike one of Caleb's
interviews, he was just like, S1 suck as
[SPEAKER_08]: far as like their growing capability.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just like, yeah, yeah,
I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they're kind of a pain to work with
sometimes, but like the things you can
[SPEAKER_08]: find in them, you can't find anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so like, I also love them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you still happen to have that,
uh, immaculate photograph of the Skittles
[SPEAKER_07]: plant that you had the very high
definition, um, prop that you had for the
[SPEAKER_07]: last episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there's that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good prop.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you had another prop.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a diagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my drawing, but I can, you know,
you know what I have to do another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very fast at art.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I, while you guys are taking more
questions, I will draw this for you real
[SPEAKER_03]: quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one I saw like really early that
I wrote on my, my notepad was,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, have you worked any CBD lines?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I have had the pleasure of
working a ton of CBD lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, uh, involved in people trying to
make a ton of money on hemp seed and all
[SPEAKER_08]: that in the early days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I collected, I still have just like
multi-pound baggies of so much hemp and
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, I did a ton of stuff with Ringo's
gift, which is an awesome cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you ever have the chance to get hybrids
of that, um, they're, they're really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would kind of, I'm trying to think who
the better sources of that would be
[SPEAKER_08]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but, um, I got to work a bunch of that
Willie G's Lebanese stuff and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_08]: hybrids of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that, that wasn't consistently high
CBD, but there were some really cool
[SPEAKER_08]: plants in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're on my, my IG, uh, Caleb wants to
know about that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think which one, uh, the last time you
talked about the Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the Willie G.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, did I have so much?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have like the pure direct, cause I,
I did some work with those guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so like, I have so much of that if he
ever wants any like absolute fuck tons,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he actually bought a bunch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: They, they would, they would range from
like three to 7% CBD and then an equal
[SPEAKER_08]: amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of instances, there was a lot of
one-to-one stuff in there, which is in my
[SPEAKER_08]: opinion, like more useful than like pure
CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of instances for the end
consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but, um, dead on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even, even this top blood right here,
that's all, where is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That one?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all ugly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: A while back we had a, we had a chat about
like different LEDs on the general chat on
[SPEAKER_08]: the discord.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, I was talking about some lighting
trials with these Gavita.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, I can't ever remember what
the model number is, but it's the ones
[SPEAKER_08]: that look like, yeah, it's like the plasma
style ones where it looks like a Gavita
[SPEAKER_08]: fit, like a standard HBS fixture kind of,
or like the profile of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're way up high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just this little like,
you know, 18 inch by 10 inch little
[SPEAKER_08]: fixture up top.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I recently saw some Skittles in week
eight, um, like a day ago, day and a half
[SPEAKER_08]: ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and the expression of it was,
I'd never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was dark purple, like thoroughly,
thoroughly dark purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it, the nose wasn't really there
either.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was like, Oh man, this is fucking
really weird, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I liked it still.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was still good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just different.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was an interesting little
tidbit I'd share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, showed that there were something
else I just saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I knew what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gavita.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did hit up Gavita to see if they wanted
to work with us on anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually said, no, actually said,
no, we're not interested in working with
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are fucking lame.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of these days we'll get AC infinity
and they can eat 10 dicks.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we need to make an episode about the
sponsorships that we don't get.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing some interesting questions
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't star them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one, um, just recently won an
auction of Mr. Nice for G 13 IBL
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically stabilized, but essentially an
S one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on its authenticity
in general opinion?
[SPEAKER_03]: The only G 13 S one that I know of that
made it over there were the ones that I
[SPEAKER_03]: sent Neville of, um, the airborne G that I
had made the S ones of airborne G 13 S
[SPEAKER_03]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he used those in projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I don't know if he ever gave any of
those to Shanti, but there weren't so many
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds that there's like packs to sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, G 13 died a long time ago,
so I'm not sure how that would work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I have a lot of respect for Shanti a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, a lot of people still do.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been some interesting stuff on
Instagram lately that doesn't quite
[SPEAKER_03]: correlate with what we know in history or
previous claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just don't know if that's like just
being tired after all these years,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting asked a million questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually something's going to,
um, not correlate, but then there's things
[SPEAKER_03]: like showing a picture of Haysi that is
obsolete chosen male of something
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different, you know,
like saying, Hey, this is the Haysi mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, Oh wait, no, we're familiar
with that picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Opsil's mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, things like that, that do confuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while qualifying it with that,
like I've used a lot of, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really love any of the Afghani
based stuff, but with that said,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the main things I chase is the
Afghan T which is Dutch Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, it's, it's a hard,
it's a hard one to answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I just don't think he's as
consistent as he used to be, but I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know if that, as far as with his answers,
um, I just don't know how that represents
[SPEAKER_03]: what he's selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the nicest way I can say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone asked, uh, is it worth trying
AG Seed Co or Scott Blakey, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: Shanti Baba Mr. Nice to bring in older
lying to today's hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would dodge AG Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather, I'm going to get myself in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, that guy's a, uh, turd and a
half.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty evident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even have to comment on that,
that dude, but Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like I know people popping mango
haze from Mr. Nice, you know, last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I'd say that's just as good a
place to start as any.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep hearing there was at least two
different lines, expressions of Durban.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Mel Frank, uh, Durban,
which is supposed to be a more aniseed
[SPEAKER_03]: like black licorice smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's a common trait it passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the Durban clone that
circulates California, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that is very trippinoline.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trippinoline one seems to be the one
that has like spun the world, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: or spun California and what most people
are, are familiar with as far as,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, Durban right now, and which is not
related to the F wonder by any stretch of
[SPEAKER_03]: the imagination.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Matt, we had one on like your most,
uh, humidity resistant bonnet crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bubble berry for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the bubble gum breeds true.
[SPEAKER_03]: For, uh, humidity, like humidity
resistance, mold resistance, all that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's proven itself outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Related question, Matt, but not exactly
the same strains that would work near the
[SPEAKER_07]: equator.
[SPEAKER_07]: So tropics, uh, equatorial strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's where, like if I live by the
equator, that's where I would be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be shopping over at quick seeds,
K W I K seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, the real seed co I'd be running
equity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would be taking advantage of that
grow, grow what works best for your area,
[SPEAKER_03]: not what type.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, if there's anything that we've
tried to push across these episodes,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of people are growing based on
what they've been told is dank and the
[SPEAKER_03]: lines that they've, you know, that certain
brainers like, oh, this is the line,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the clone only.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the dank one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of times those lines suck in
other environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think cookies mainly got popular
because it's fucking easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody looks like a pro growing
cookies because you can throw nitrogen at
[SPEAKER_03]: it all through flour, feed it like a
tomato and it looks fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll smoke like shit, but it looks fine
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how all this shit sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you probably shouldn't try to grow like
bubbles by the equator.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I had this discussion with someone
tonight that was doing the, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: black Friday cell thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had picked up some of the
freebies of the blue resin Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after they grabbed it right before
they paid them like, Hey, this is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: work great outdoors in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, no, no, no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be running Kush outdoor in New York
when it's all, you know, in the humid in
[SPEAKER_03]: upstate New York where it's all humid and
foggy and, or whatever it is, it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's humid as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I ended up sending him the bubble
berry direction because of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: just because it doesn't make any sense to
grow something that is likely going to
[SPEAKER_03]: mold or get botrytis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any information on the F1 derb that CSI
used pictures where he got anything I
[SPEAKER_03]: grabbed quite a few crosses of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I sourced the F1 derb.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, that was my sourcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I had had the cut originally and,
uh, it, none of the crosses really sold of
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tossed it, but over the years,
I had, I'd wanted to do more than just one
[SPEAKER_03]: run with it and make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to check out more of what it was
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, frost boss to Stoney to me is how the
F1 derb, um, made its way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frost boss was a part of the original
cookie crew Stoney no longer with us rest
[SPEAKER_03]: in peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to me, um, or I'm sorry,
Stoney to CSI sourced by me because I
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't growing at the time and I was
moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to go straight over to CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't show pictures on here because
YouTube just screws us anytime we show
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures of weed cause they suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but there are pictures in our,
our codex that you can find to the F1
[SPEAKER_03]: derb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's an entry about it in there,
more info about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go to our codex dot the read codex dot
the reader syndicate.com and type in F1
[SPEAKER_03]: derb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll pop up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see pictures and info.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think video too, maybe not video
pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: The link is in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Links in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I repeated that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can hear you just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which HP 13 did you get sent?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's how you do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which HP 13 did you get?
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent me the Z HP 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you asked someone else, not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, um, the, the most common question
we get about HP 13 is if it's related to G
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 and it is not related to G 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same as G 13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an old Hawaiian cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially the story goes is just a
selection of hash plant number 13,
[SPEAKER_03]: the 13th selection of hash plant and CC
hash plant, which is hash plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: nor the lights one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's supposed to be what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and maybe it is, I think so probably
I have no reason to doubt that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but people see G 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: HP and automatically assume that's the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, they both have hash plan in them,
but G 13 makes HP 13 very different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd be surprised how much in like big
companies, documentation and stuff,
[SPEAKER_08]: how much the original names like HP 13,
like, and those like little short acronyms
[SPEAKER_08]: like that still like persist at our place.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have tons of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So fucking many of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like the names, the,
the real names.
[SPEAKER_08]: The names of what we call like a lot of
like cuts that people would know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, HP 13 too, was one that I hunted for
years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because at the, during the time,
I don't talk about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mean, maybe I do some,
when I was one of the few people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States making fem seeds,
what happened was a lot of other quote
[SPEAKER_03]: unquote breeders and clone traders locked
me out of cuts because they were scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make S ones of every single cut,
which I wasn't doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were very scared of that and they
didn't want to leave that potential there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So HP 13 was one of those cuts that I was
locked out of because they didn't want HP
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 S ones at the time going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tried for years to get that cut and
then eventually we sourced it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was very hyped and it was one of
those cuts that once I got it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, this is what I was
hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I probably wouldn't have hunted
that, you know, I don't really like cash
[SPEAKER_03]: plant myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone said Reeferman is Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone said Reeferman is Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he had a, he had a strain called
Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it wasn't, it wasn't made by him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made by C Ray or scabby from white
Buffalo seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones who actually made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, uh, they were working for
Reeferman and sold it through him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Vietnamese black something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the other half,
but it was dank, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and most of the good stuff that came
from Reeferman was made by him.
[SPEAKER_03]: By other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I got in the, um, when you
sent out old seeds with the GA three.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you sent me Willie Nelson F twos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're the one who got those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to do that whole experiment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just been busy as you guys know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare you, the weed sent so many seeds
out that he doesn't, he doesn't remember
[SPEAKER_07]: who's landed with who.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any cuts are circulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen Willie 13 cuts,
but like, or Willie Nelson, but that's
[SPEAKER_03]: like a Canadian thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure if there are, there's cuts up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check Montreal and all those dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I have starred here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Describe the HP 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming they mean growth
characteristics and turf profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I saw it, it was apples and feet
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows like a short squat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not, I would, I would ask CSI
better because the grow I smoked of it was
[SPEAKER_03]: not very good at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just smelled apples and feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a big fan of those apple aromas.
Honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like apples and feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it just didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the sweet ones like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm out of like the apples and bananas
type shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I'm just an apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all those I've grown once and I've
just been like, Oh, yeah, I can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there was this one that I put up a
running Peaberry and found a killer
[SPEAKER_03]: smelling male blueberry muffins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about your work in blue
bonnet male selection?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone over it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do people want to hear that again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I go over that again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the blue bonnet male was a,
is basically a, for your project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's still kind of going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is not even over, but to get to the
point of where I was actually selling
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, it had been three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went through the process of running
every single blue line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to see every expression of blue,
learn everything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also with the idea of finding a
breeding male and female, um, to select
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it was just that the blue
bonnet, like it already had a renowned
[SPEAKER_03]: reputation, um, of being an amazing blue
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I released my original right,
very stuff, it was the line that was
[SPEAKER_03]: competing with mine and everybody would
say, Oh, you got blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Lone Star's got a good blueberry
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like, fuck him.
[SPEAKER_03]: My blueberry is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, eventually I ran out all that stock,
sold all that stock, stopped working with
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry and then wanted to work with it
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I was able to source old
blue bonnet stock from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had some in his collection and sent it
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mail, the most specific thing I
remember when going through all this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, the mail had the traits in
blueberry that I look for when I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: look for a blue breeding male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which I don't really care to share
because it'll give JD and all those
[SPEAKER_03]: idiots, uh, a major leg up and they should
already know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but the one trait that did stand out
to me was that the, it was praying nonstop
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's not just praying out of health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is like a six foot male from
the top to bottom fan leaf was like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: this angle, all of them from top to
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it almost looked like he was waving,
like raising his hands and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I really wasn't sure even when I
used him up until when he blew pollen that
[SPEAKER_03]: he was going to be who I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very, very convinced I was going to
have to do this round, run through that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not be it go back, select another
male, do another round.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first instance, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like I had gone the right direction
was when the mail was blowing his pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I finally went in, shook him,
hit the fan and I had on a big,
[SPEAKER_03]: like one of those, uh, gas masks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it covers your whole face and a
shield and it's got the big cans,
[SPEAKER_03]: like one of those expensive ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wearing that because I'm super
allergic to pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was all indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through that mask and this mask,
like you're, you can wear it like cleaning
[SPEAKER_03]: up feces and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, the smell doesn't penetrate too
much, but I could smell heavy blueberry
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry jam type smells just by smacking
the mail around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I was like, got this
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one I knew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even then you don't really know,
no, because just because it expresses blue
[SPEAKER_03]: and berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't mean it's going to breed true for
that trait, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it could just show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it could be the one in a
thousand that showed this trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you read with it, it's only going
to show up one in 500, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I got very lucky and that's,
that's pretty much the story of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just the best blueberry
breeder I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't have anything to do with
creating it or making it or no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any responsibility for why it
was such a good line, but it ended up
[SPEAKER_03]: being a great line.
[SPEAKER_07]: Matt, I'm glad you told the story again,
because I was just thinking about,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, if I run some of your blueberry
in cross and kind of have to like blind
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of blind select a male, you know,
this story kind of reminds me about like
[SPEAKER_07]: what I should be looking out for or
thinking about it anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like if you're selecting towards
blueberry, the first trait that I look
[SPEAKER_03]: for, I don't even mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I mean, it's just, it is one of
those things it's, it's purple striped
[SPEAKER_03]: stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want a full purple stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to see stripes in the stock and
it not be, and you have to know how to
[SPEAKER_03]: feed because you can, you can get this
from all kinds of deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it has to be genetic and it has
to look a certain way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the purple stripe stocks, they've just
always been that telltale for me to when I
[SPEAKER_03]: know, okay, that's a berry line.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a berry line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also learned that going towards the
more narrow leaf, berry expressions like
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the old time moonshine, the blue
moonshine, the, uh, banaluna.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, blue satellite to a degree,
um, uh, rocket moonshine, rocket fuel,
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more narrow leaf, the blueberry is in
there, but it's more recessive in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's harder to get to and harder to breed
true.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Afghani in blueberry is what through
the blueberry originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had been chasing blueberry Sativa stuff
to find the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had noticed when I popped the blue
bonnet, it was all Afghani looking and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was really, really thinking, Oh no,
I'm not going to find it in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Except that I just went with my gut and
realized, Oh my God, I should have been
[SPEAKER_03]: chasing Afghani all along.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I like, I like a more narrow
leaf type highs, but in the end it had the
[SPEAKER_03]: high that I wanted regardless of the
taxonomy of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that helps them.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, this whole little tangent has
kind of reminded me of when I was looking
[SPEAKER_08]: through, um, like some of my private
gelato work that I did a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, like, I think I've told you about
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did like an ICC Mac wedding cake and my
idea was to call it end game because I was
[SPEAKER_08]: never going to breed with this shit again.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I got the job that I currently
have.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's funny is I actually recently
popped those at work too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, cause it's like, it's a really
nice, um, like gelato cookie baseline.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, anyway, the whole thing just
reminded me of how I found that mail.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so like a buddy had given me two
packs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like him and another dude,
uh, that we were friends with up in the
[SPEAKER_08]: triangle, uh, made the, the Mac wedding
cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, um, they, my buddy crossed it to
the ICC cut that I gave him, and then he
[SPEAKER_08]: gave me two packs of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm going through it and I find
this, most of the males just look like
[SPEAKER_08]: normal weed plants, but I find this one
thing that's just like this cousin it,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like super notey, just like the shortest
inner node I've ever seen on like any male
[SPEAKER_08]: plant ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like on average, less than one inch,
you know, and it was just like draped with
[SPEAKER_08]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we called it cousin it,
you know, like from the admin family,
[SPEAKER_08]: cause it's just like covered and it would
droop all the time because it was in like
[SPEAKER_08]: a 10 gallon pot and I had to water it like
three times a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just beastly, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, I knew it's just one of those
things, you know, is just like,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so far everything I've crossed it with
has been like pretty fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been getting a lot of feedback
from, uh, I got, especially one,
[SPEAKER_08]: the one that I crossed into my key lime
work was just like this killer super
[SPEAKER_08]: stacked version of key lime, you know,
and this dude down in Houston found it and
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just like, Holy shit, that's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, and so like sometimes with males,
you just know, and then other times you
[SPEAKER_08]: have to like, like I wasn't very intimate
with that line, but it just like,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's that gut instinct of, of the breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you've got to roll with it,
you know, and then other times,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, your line super, super well,
and you're just like, I know this exact
[SPEAKER_08]: trait to look for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's like two sides of that coin,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's, that's a part of like what
we talk about, just learning your,
[SPEAKER_03]: your clones, you know, um, you run them
enough, you'll get to see them expressed
[SPEAKER_03]: differently in the same room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you run them with different
mediums, different nutrients, feed it a
[SPEAKER_03]: little different and being able to see all
those different expressions gives you
[SPEAKER_03]: ideas for how it's going to breed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, just as a little admin note,
uh, I'll just mention that, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: local is having some technical issues with
his microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, hopefully he will be on with us soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: This adobo hit way too hard tonight.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can't figure out his head.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is he trying to talk again?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I do have one note.
[SPEAKER_03]: For everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so a lot of, you know, like I have a
buddy named Natalie, he used to own elite
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis with, uh, some of his other
friends and he did some of the best chem
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as far as regular seed breeding,
I don't know that anybody's done better
[SPEAKER_03]: chem 91 and dog breeding than him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I, it's taken me years to
convince him, but he's going to send in
[SPEAKER_03]: some seeds finally for the site,
um, for the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep your eyes peeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I don't heavily vouch for a lot of
other people's stuff very often anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, main reason Matt doesn't sell seeds is
because he hates seed drama and he would
[SPEAKER_03]: much rather not deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to beg him to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I'm pretty stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got, I've read a lot of the D I
netted by work from other people and I
[SPEAKER_03]: just, he knew the chem so well,
like I sourced a lot of my best cuts for
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, after, after Mooney killed my
whole collection, that was one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: first people to line up and be like,
Hey dude, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I get you back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get you back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Triangle?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get you back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Headband?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get you back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, day wrecker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get, he was where all that second
round of stuff came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I owe Matt a huge debt of gratitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: His sourcing of cuts has always been
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had anything be like,
I don't know if that's the right cut,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's always had it get on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm stoked for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys hear me now by the way?
Welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just had to take my headset.
[SPEAKER_06]: Set off.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you're not getting any background.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good word.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was worried about mainly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, this word does it to me constantly
when I'm trying to game with people and I
[SPEAKER_08]: just have to like reset everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just like, this is so fucking
dumb.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's nothing to fix.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like literally like taking it
off the setting it was on and then putting
[SPEAKER_08]: it back onto the same exact setting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, Oh, it fucking works now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, someone said money, Mike for the win.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, shout out money, Mike for the,
the KMD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the I-95 work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I saw money, Mike the other day on,
um, in a private forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was good to see him back too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he's back fucking hanging out,
shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him in person too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super kind, super, super generous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, not a bad word at all to say
about him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I-95 is some fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: His street fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was just going to be a poly
hybrid mess, but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty excited to see that 56 day,
uh, hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that DI-95 it's looking really nice
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squatter OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: It stacks really nice too, from what it's
seeming.
[SPEAKER_06]: The nodes aren't too space apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you'd expect OG to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty exciting, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, local.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a, we had a specific question for
you from Jebs earlier, uh, wanted to know
[SPEAKER_07]: about your experience with weird
variegation that shows up in super Scott.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lines and how he thinks it's related to
feeding Matt, you probably weigh in as
[SPEAKER_07]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen a few things get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't believe in cow mag,
but I find that bumping your calcium
[SPEAKER_06]: levels a little bit up and your magnesium
up as well, uh, tend to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've also started looking at it in the
way of, uh, what ions are responsible for
[SPEAKER_06]: like chlorophyll production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like that's things like calcium,
I think of magnesium, iron, some other
[SPEAKER_06]: micros.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they kind of seem to like those things
a little more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I mean, it doesn't get rid of it
permanently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, LEDs have made it worse in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but that's really kind of the only
thing is just kind of bump up those
[SPEAKER_06]: secondaries and micros really.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've noticed the same exact thing
and that the, all those kinds of super
[SPEAKER_08]: skunk type lines, like sour hybrids and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, they all are just like pretty
naturally heavy feeders too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're a low and slow guy,
it might be time to bump it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm dealing with it right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some, uh, blue dream work and some
sour gorilla glue in the same tent and
[SPEAKER_08]: they want absolutely different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I have to mix up two different
buckets every single time because the,
[SPEAKER_08]: the, blueberry stuff doesn't want and the
blue dream stuff, it's, it's not like a
[SPEAKER_08]: super high nitro feeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberry hates nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone asked about, hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's cover, let me, let me cover this
real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause this is something I feel like in the
past 10 or nine seasons that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_03]: covered accurately.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll fix that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause every time I talked about it,
I got shut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, headband, uh, as it started,
as best we understand was diesel two in
[SPEAKER_03]: New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's from the sour crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: The our chem bag seeds, um, as it was
originally labeled, you know, became
[SPEAKER_03]: labeled at an S sour cam because they
didn't have the term diesel applied to
[SPEAKER_03]: chem yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That came later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as the cut made its way to California,
as best I understand, or the OG cut made
[SPEAKER_03]: it to New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't remember which way it went.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think OG went to New York and they,
and the person that brought it out there
[SPEAKER_03]: gave the stipulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot call this OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they renamed it headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why there's more than one headband,
but it only got more complicated after
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's been so many seed lines called
headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many posers right now that
have only been growing less than five
[SPEAKER_03]: years with headband and their names stuck
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two types of headbands.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Kemi diesel headband,
and then there's the OG Kush headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a sour OG, it's not headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a later headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a good definition for headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, a sour OG hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't know how to say it any
clearer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the people stacking their names with
headband are all idiots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop following that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of those are headbands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop asking questions about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if it's not a pure OG cut,
it's not the headband, which I,
[SPEAKER_03]: the 56 day headband is a pure OG cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That story stayed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the diesel number two, I don't know
that anybody has that alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say that the OG, the 56 day
headband is probably the best
[SPEAKER_03]: representation of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that anything that is otherwise
doesn't have great stories or provenance
[SPEAKER_03]: leading back to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I'll leave it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I feel like our show helps us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helped push a narrative for a while
that there was one legit sour,
[SPEAKER_03]: one legit headband cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I don't like to undermine people
at the same time, but I, and I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: that that story was necessarily pushed
with that intention, but over time it just
[SPEAKER_03]: seemed to develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the LA Kush headband came from
Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should never been called LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't from LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should never been called headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but that's what Mandelkrotch called
it, cause that's who he is and he's no
[SPEAKER_03]: longer with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can't ask him why he renamed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's an excellent diesel type.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said, there's no provenance to
it being headband, you know, Reserva
[SPEAKER_03]: Provada headband again, much later.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a later seed line, no purpose in
even discussing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with Cali Connections headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all sour OG types or whatever he
was selling as sour OG at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, I mean, I love skunk tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my boys, but yeah,
his headband is not going to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: original headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came in way late for the game to know
what's what there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, you know, it just,
it's just kind of one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: People stick people's names next to stuff
and it's like, Oh, you know, like that's
[SPEAKER_03]: the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people start hyping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, do you hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one, that's the one it's like,
dude, we know what the ones are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they are, it's been all like,
people are still asking like savage
[SPEAKER_03]: headband apothecary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already said it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, none of that shit's headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer is no, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, fucking die in here,
muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to keep asking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mandelbrot also kind of a junkie vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the cops went to his house.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, yeah, I, um, I,
um, I have pretty decent access to a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of cuts through, through my job.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are no decent, or there's
actually just no, any headband cuts
[SPEAKER_08]: floating around the larger scene and the
commercial scene at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like people want them and they're just
not there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's AJ sour and that's as close
as you can get to any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not that close.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, you know, I think there's just
being, being privately held.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's confusing because the same
group that named it headband also got an
[SPEAKER_03]: OG cut and then name that headband too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was distributed more than the
original headband was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it came from that crew,
everybody assumed that that must be the
[SPEAKER_03]: cam headband, whereas it just not the
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think legitimately, if the diesel never
to left that crew, um, or, you know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that, that selection that was called
headband, if it really didn't last the
[SPEAKER_03]: test of time, then legitimately the 56
days, probably it was one of those dudes
[SPEAKER_08]: pop seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once he came out to Cal to LA too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't know who was out in LA.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was, I can't remember what I'm
thinking of, but it was a story I've heard
[SPEAKER_08]: from you on the show, but I was like that
one of those dudes that was originally in
[SPEAKER_08]: there, um, uh, moved out to LA after all
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then pop seeds, but that kind of is
where like the story just like captain and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's, I think that's where it fell down
because, um, the cut came from LA to New
[SPEAKER_03]: York.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is one of the ones that
not so would repeat a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, from LA to New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, it was Mojave that sent the
cut out there or brought it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was in LA and somehow the story got
confabulated to where OG, there was people
[SPEAKER_03]: murdered, all kinds of dumb ass shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it was, it was very confabulated,
but lately, um, within the past month,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've had all of them come out on my
profile during a discussion of headband
[SPEAKER_03]: and lay it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, granted it's not easy to pick apart in
some ways, but we, we kind of get apart.
[SPEAKER_08]: That pre 61 cut pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is the Denali headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the only legit one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that check.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is HSC's headband of faith.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who the fuck is HSC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Humble Seiko like, it doesn't matter how
many times I say like, bro, stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I say, yeah, they're one of the
biggest brands right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're a new marketing and you
probably will.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the main thing is they're one of the
only seeds you can buy in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a huge thing that they did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, I mean, they just like put that
legwork in too.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: To get the state license on a small little
farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess on, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like a game side to all of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like the main thing was, is that most
people's sales were like nationwide,
[SPEAKER_08]: why would they sign up for state
licensing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that limits you to exclusive state
sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides like backdooring and white
labeling stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so like, in some ways I can respect
the hustle, but like, I also have like
[SPEAKER_08]: more intimate knowledge on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still don't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They stole my blueberry muffin name and
slapped it on their bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That dark heart license.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cut the dark heart license.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I've never liked it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I was like around for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as like up there in the community,
like a new people that worked with them
[SPEAKER_08]: and like did work with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, it's just a, I never liked that
specific selection very much at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know why it got circulated so
widely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's just because nothing
blueberry had been really widely
[SPEAKER_08]: circulated for a while, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that it's like that blueberry
muffin because it does smell exactly like
[SPEAKER_08]: baked blueberry muffins or like the
hostess little mini blueberry muffin kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of deals.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's like, that's like C
tier blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's any, I want blueberry scissor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got really mad mostly because we had
spent six years prior to that building up
[SPEAKER_03]: a blueberry muffin cut, like showing
pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the most used picture of blueberry
and stolen picture of blueberry ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they popped up, used the
marketing from that and the steam from
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Took it for themselves, sold the cut to
Dark Heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like, well, there goes
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I, that's really when I
stopped trying to work on advertising and
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing of any one strain or any kind of
effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I realized, oh, the first one to do
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one with the most money in the
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I realized maybe I don't
even get mad about this shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus their marketing is pretty appealing.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the whole thing is that like,
if you can, if you can do decent
[SPEAKER_08]: marketing, you can sell a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
They're a whole new spl darancome into the
seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about just like people knowing
who you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause there's a much wider market for
people that just want to like,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're like, Oh, I do smoke weed,
but like what's up with the seed thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And like bringing new people in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like, especially in like
California, they're in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're like probably the first seed
company that most people first getting
[SPEAKER_08]: into growing in the last five years have
kind of come across.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and they have some decent stuff like
I found some decent stuff in there But
[SPEAKER_08]: that was from like their original stuff
before they made it big, you know Like I
[SPEAKER_08]: used to buy some of their seeds at a yeah
HPRC in Arcata.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the other hard part like yeah
taking because they they popped up I Had
[SPEAKER_03]: no interaction with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't go up to Humboldt and hang out in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not like a mountain, dude When they
popped up on the main scene you are I am
[SPEAKER_03]: trash And they popped up on the main seed
scene like they were nobody to me because
[SPEAKER_03]: they weren't involved in the whole
breeding community worldwide They weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: selling seeds worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't a major seed mover at the
time So I was just like who the hell are
[SPEAKER_03]: these people showing up and just taking
the name I thought they were nobodies from
[SPEAKER_03]: nowhere, you know They had been around for
a long time up in Humboldt and just much
[SPEAKER_03]: more small time that I was but they
quickly became big-time Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: No They're their farm is deep too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking out there, bro They buy a lot
of seeds and repackage them that's that's
[SPEAKER_03]: the name that is exactly what they do now
their see Yeah, that's my seeds Right,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I mean, that's where it ends up white
label seeds You stop making your own seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's probably more money in
that, you know Now the business acumen and
[SPEAKER_08]: the business side is there but it's Like
the more intimate knowledge I have of the
[SPEAKER_08]: practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, ah, nah Just big fat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nah, like that's not how you do it Someone
I need an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can answer this one dad Anybody know
what the longest flower time is being used
[SPEAKER_08]: in the commercial industry I'm hearing
everything it's taken at eight to nine
[SPEAKER_08]: weeks regardless of fully ripe anyone
doing ten to twelve plus week No,
[SPEAKER_08]: so what we do you're like kind of right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't say Eight is standard at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say it's more nine to ten And really
like on average just nine like people pick
[SPEAKER_08]: 56 to 63 day stuff But like skittles and
skittles hybrids are the only thing that I
[SPEAKER_08]: take it eight weeks And what we actually
do is we stagger to where skills goes into
[SPEAKER_08]: the room late So that way it's all getting
harvested at the same time because that's
[SPEAKER_08]: actually way easier to manage Then
harvesting something separate but we do
[SPEAKER_08]: have longer flowering stuff But normally
what you do is you try and cross that to
[SPEAKER_08]: something that's more normal flowering
something usually gelato based Because
[SPEAKER_08]: it'll also bulk it up And so I have some
stuff that started as like 13 14 week
[SPEAKER_08]: flowering stuff and within one or two
breeding cycles We've brought that down to
[SPEAKER_08]: nine to ten weeks and it still throws down
just like 2x yields of sativa size bats
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I have some pictures that would blow
your minds of some sativa type stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: actually, I was just Saw that cornbread
Ricky had posted about his legends of
[SPEAKER_08]: Nigeria that cut his foot that line is
fucking sick like I've worked it and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: really fucking cool and it throws down
just like 30 plus percent THC turpinoline
[SPEAKER_08]: dominant sativa bats and so I've had a lot
of fun with that line and it is a S-tier
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke S-tier was that is that good or bad
best?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no SS is like it's a BC like,
you know, I don't know why that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a gaming thing is where I heard it
first Local Thousand other youths what
[SPEAKER_07]: would know it's like an anime thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think is it an anime thing originally
Like fighting games
[SPEAKER_08]: To be fair, I actually like it just makes
me think of like Harvesting something in a
[SPEAKER_08]: non-average window like seven to eight
weeks even though it is a nine week strain
[SPEAKER_08]: based on hash processing Oil extraction
all of that kind of stuff Yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: or just like bumping up tests.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've recently seen it where a like 29% THC
really like That's like kind of the higher
[SPEAKER_08]: end of what I like usually will expect out
of a commercial hybrid And then you take
[SPEAKER_08]: it at week seven for hash and you test the
flower and it tests at 39% THC And you
[SPEAKER_08]: know and like 40% total cannabinoids and
I'm like, but it's just because the flower
[SPEAKER_08]: mass is not developed and so it's
technically true You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you see the same thing from a
standard poll versus an early poll and
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like it's so much more filled out
like I was just looking at samples today
[SPEAKER_08]: that was like something harvested 14 days
before the other and like the but the same
[SPEAKER_08]: clone and Like the difference of it is
like you wouldn't expect it to be that
[SPEAKER_08]: much mass and size But it's genuinely like
the three-quarter version of the other one
[SPEAKER_08]: and half as dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Here's one here you guys can
answer this one Consider being interviewed
[SPEAKER_08]: on someone else's podcast I mean like
maybe but no like I mean I just like no my
[SPEAKER_08]: boys and no my crew and like know what I
can and can't say and The whole thing with
[SPEAKER_08]: like the cultural norms like I at least
trying to keep it even though it's not
[SPEAKER_08]: like very standard anymore is that it's
just like It's hard to know what you can
[SPEAKER_08]: say around what people And yeah Yeah,
or just like I don't want to like out
[SPEAKER_08]: myself in some stupid way or Like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like I've signed paperwork and
shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So For me it's a no That's gonna be a no
dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding I've done them but
like I'm pretty picky like if someone
[SPEAKER_03]: interviews a bunch of fucking lames and
scammers and then it's like hey you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to come on my pot I won't do it just
because I don't want to be associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: same group of shitheads.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been the biggest problem But you
know, I mean like that's just my anal way
[SPEAKER_03]: that I am You know, I these guys are more
than welcome to you on any podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'd be good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I Don't I don't see any context in which
it would make sense for me to be
[SPEAKER_07]: interviewed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Yeah, I think the same thing with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also make it a safe that I haven't
already said same Yeah, just one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to there aren't many podcasts like
other than like booze podcast Matt booze
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's so few that I would even be
interested in
[SPEAKER_07]: Give you a bit of context.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so he he started one I think they
they have a few episodes But he got really
[SPEAKER_07]: busy and then the idea was that he would
actually join forces with us essentially,
[SPEAKER_07]: but he's still really busy So we're just
kind of waiting for him to like for his
[SPEAKER_08]: life to give him a break Yeah,
I feel you on that booze and we stole him
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't know I mean like I did
the podcast most people know that but I
[SPEAKER_08]: wasn't necessarily super Joe I can tell
you a story about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just peaks my I was I was moving away
from Eugene, Oregon and I'm driving out to
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking Oklahoma and so like I didn't know
a lot of weed podcasts yet, but I like
[SPEAKER_08]: downloaded a fuck ton of episodes of the
podcast and that was the first time I had
[SPEAKER_08]: come across you and so this is 2020 and
Anyway, I just remember listening to it
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm like driving through the Cascade
Mountains on day one and I'm just like
[SPEAKER_08]: listening to you to talk so much fucking
shit about Everyone in the industry and I
[SPEAKER_08]: was like, this is my guy He's saying
everything that I think when I'm scrolling
[SPEAKER_08]: through IG motherfucker, this is my dude
and so like Yeah, that's just funny how it
[SPEAKER_08]: all works around and that in these weird
ways in life You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, but it's just like I hear you on a
podcast I knew we'd be friends and then
[SPEAKER_08]: like years down the line.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like yo, what's up, though?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we ended up fucking him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know what your ass smells like
Yeah, I don't know, you know, like I I
[SPEAKER_03]: never relistened to my podcast episode So
I don't you remember what I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I just know how I am And if people ask
me certain questions, there's no doubt
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm gonna say something Fucked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I listened to I re listened to my
first one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just like I don't want to get fired
So like what did I actually say?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good idea, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to screen myself and it's too late
even if I did, you know Yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's also just like it's hard
because podcasts like for example with the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast he interviewed some like
legitimate people at the beginning and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was okay to be With a part of that but
like after me like, you know interviewing
[SPEAKER_03]: straight-up scammers straight-up liars
tweakers just like and Then people start
[SPEAKER_03]: saying oh you were on that show a same
show you're friends with that guy You must
[SPEAKER_03]: be if he interviewed you you must be
friends with the other people And that
[SPEAKER_03]: people really make those associations and
like I hadn't forethought that I hadn't
[SPEAKER_03]: thought about that in advance and that's
when I started to be more protective about
[SPEAKER_03]: What shows I went on and some people take
it fucking sideways when I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, I'm not gonna do that show You
interviewed too many scammers like and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not what they want to hear,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nobody wants to hear that and
I'm an asshole for it But it just is what
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't want to have my name Yeah,
there's oh yeah Steve long that's my UFO
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the UFO master I'm just like sitting
here reading the chat and like outside the
[SPEAKER_08]: blocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like yeah It sucks that we can't have
real conversations for like fear of
[SPEAKER_08]: consequences and it's a but it's it's
really true like there's some things that
[SPEAKER_08]: I will 100% say to the discord or unlike
certain groupings of people within the
[SPEAKER_08]: discord that I would never say on the show
Or sure, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and then there's other things that
like and it just goes down the line like
[SPEAKER_08]: that It's like what I say on Instagram is
like by far the most like like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know cultivated and marketed way of
saying it, you know possible, but it's
[SPEAKER_08]: just like I don't know join the discord.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll learn some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess I'm more open there Too like
I used to be just all out unfiltered
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever but even on Instagram over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like it alienates me from friends who
happen to not be as stringent with who
[SPEAKER_03]: they let around them like a lot of friends
that I have are friends with shitbags and
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say something publicly that shit
bag goes in bitches to this person,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so It causes a lot of problems
and then then you know, just straight up
[SPEAKER_03]: people will snitch on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll call the cops on you have your
house Do wild shit just because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interfering with their scammy money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah Let's see do any of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here's a good one Any of you
accidentally breed out traits that you
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't want to lose.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you do about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you start over and always keep
your up You keep each generation and some
[SPEAKER_03]: seed from each so you can go back and try
to correct that That's really all you can
[SPEAKER_03]: do if you lose lose lose a trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no going forward to get it back
most of the time It's gone.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the only way to do it is to go
backwards Yeah, yep, and it really sucks
[SPEAKER_08]: because a lot of times it's like
everything in life The things that you
[SPEAKER_08]: really wish you can go back to or like
just out of reach You're like fuck I
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't save that one generation or I
didn't save that oldest one, you know For
[SPEAKER_03]: example my my right Barry that was my
favorite blueberry line But there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of stuff with it that I didn't like
which is why Another reason they didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: just go back ask some friends for old
stock and do work it from that generation
[SPEAKER_03]: It was missing resin production and it was
missing recreational potency and no matter
[SPEAKER_03]: what I did I could not bring up resin
production and I could not Bring up
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational potency without losing the
blueberry turps the extreme berry turps
[SPEAKER_03]: And because I didn't keep all those seeds
for myself for previous generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I could just go I'll just go
back I sold them all, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because people wanted it I was like,
okay someone else can take it further And
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one of those cases where I had to
go do the hard thing and start from
[SPEAKER_08]: scratch again Yeah, my key lime work I
don't have any of the original steps
[SPEAKER_08]: anymore I've popped them all because I've
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean you work something for a year or
two and then you kind of drop it and move
[SPEAKER_08]: on to something else and I just never kept
any of those intermediates I've used up
[SPEAKER_08]: all the other stuff like the back stock
and the BX ones and Things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm just like it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sometimes that's just how it goes,
you know What was the first blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid you tried It's a good question
first the first one to come down that
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't seeded I Want to say it was the
blue aside was the first one I went for
[SPEAKER_03]: which was the fake Irene crossed a blue
bonnet That's gotta be the first one and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was stoked because it was so Barry,
you know Like I was like got it nailed it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know first thing first thing I'm
harvesting But by that time the whole room
[SPEAKER_03]: smelled very starting knew that but that
was the first time I realized that there
[SPEAKER_03]: were that there was recreational potency
And extreme resin production which was
[SPEAKER_03]: missing from the other ones Yeah,
you know with the discord there's always
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be some concerns like this,
you know, like you're in prohibition land,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever I'm hesitant to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Do do my best to keep that in mind
because a lot of people in the discord are
[SPEAKER_03]: from Prohibition places and that's why
there is such heavy safety in there and we
[SPEAKER_03]: try to keep it very very tight Even with
their there are some people in there that
[SPEAKER_03]: seem to be nice But could be a liability
to other people in there with how they
[SPEAKER_03]: behave We make that decision to remove
them and it's just the way it goes because
[SPEAKER_08]: we we give a shit about everybody I'm
sorry bitters comment is just too good
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's a lot of people like you can
still chat and be coy and people
[SPEAKER_08]: understand to on the discord You know a
lot especially when you're first getting
[SPEAKER_08]: acquainted like I think I lurked for about
a year on the discord before I really
[SPEAKER_08]: started DMing and reaching out to people
and I'd been listening to the show for
[SPEAKER_08]: like a year before that, you know,
and so there's no like Oh, this is a good
[SPEAKER_03]: one Yeah, I mean we've done a show on
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually done a show on Ohio weed
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay Yeah, that's right covered a lot
there because he's I don't have any direct
[SPEAKER_03]: He's our boots on the ground Ohio dude,
and he's very very into history.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went over the cuts that he had In I
have I have to say that I have met a fuck
[SPEAKER_08]: ton of people from Ohio and Humboldt there
are so many people from Ohio and New York
[SPEAKER_08]: and Humboldt and Little quick tangent like
we ran a barbershop that someone sold
[SPEAKER_08]: their weed farm and like bought a
barbershop for And it's called the trim
[SPEAKER_08]: scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sick as fuck Here we go Dan you
want this one you take into consideration
[SPEAKER_03]: whether things like weight time and other
factors for production growing or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: having an effect on overall gene pool of
cannabis especially Oh, bro, they're like
[SPEAKER_08]: the number one thing steering the gene
pool like that's what I Was talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think it was the selection episode I
did with booze and local Where I was
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about the process itself being its
own selection pressure Where it's like if
[SPEAKER_08]: it doesn't fit into the commercial
production model Then it's not gonna get
[SPEAKER_08]: selected because like most of the time
like if say it's too slow Like it's a nice
[SPEAKER_08]: little runty plant that if you baby it it
produces just this incredible smoke It'll
[SPEAKER_08]: never even make it into flower because it
didn't grow fast enough to get cloned
[SPEAKER_08]: before the rest of the main batch went
because like I don't have time in our
[SPEAKER_08]: schedule and in our speed of work to Like
wait for any individual plant You know if
[SPEAKER_08]: I pop 600 seeds and a hundred of them
don't make the cut deadline That's a
[SPEAKER_08]: hundred plants that get cut off the roster
Yeah every single time and so and that's
[SPEAKER_08]: just how it works now And I know other
groups depending on their size like
[SPEAKER_08]: there's no actual like standardized model
for a breeding Program within Canada
[SPEAKER_08]: commercial cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still very informal like I would say
the program that I work within is probably
[SPEAKER_08]: like one of the more Stringently like
structured ones, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the time it's still the owner of
the company knows a guy Yeah, and homie
[SPEAKER_08]: makes you know, I mean and maybe they make
good seeds, you know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_08]: but like It's usually how it works and
most people don't even want to allocate
[SPEAKER_08]: the funds to research And development and
they know whatever the nursery has
[SPEAKER_08]: available this year and they're like we
got new cuts We got that trough cherry and
[SPEAKER_08]: you're like cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's got trough cherry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you got that gorilla titties.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got that not orangutan titties Yeah,
but it's just like if if most like when
[SPEAKER_08]: you look across the state like in
California specifically where I work And
[SPEAKER_08]: you see the commercial offerings from the
nurseries You're gonna find the same 20 to
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 cuts usually on a given year and like
It'll rotate out two or three times a
[SPEAKER_08]: year, but like they rotate in the same
cuts, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah And so like what I see is when we get
a new cut I can directly go on IG and
[SPEAKER_08]: someone else like I can find three or four
other people that just got the same exact
[SPEAKER_08]: cut You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's it's like that every single time
and so it's a it's just how it is now,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and so Someone's asking about
PNW breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean there's archive like He's from the
PNW and his specialty is PNW historical
[SPEAKER_03]: strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone mentioned a company in here I've
never heard of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really like to send people to
companies I've never heard of because been
[SPEAKER_03]: around long enough and seen enough
companies come and go that if I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: someone that means they're probably not
that old or haven't been in it that long,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely say archive CSI also
has a large collection of Pacific
[SPEAKER_03]: Northwest heirlooms Stick to stuff that
does well in humidity, you know Fast
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering low or a high humidity strain,
so don't go for cushions, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially I do like recommending a lot
of next generation seed stuff like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadian stuff for Humid environments
whether that's New York Pacific Northwest
[SPEAKER_03]: anything on that parallel Next generation
makes great shit man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really do it's hard to Send anyone else
anywhere for like high humidity or high
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity type conditions because that's
what that stuff spread for us Outdoor high
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity Also, there's hybrids from hell
Espin.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does great work a lot of the Swiss
sativa's Stuff like that do great outdoors
[SPEAKER_03]: mighty might.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all that shit One from Alice It's a
pretty common question I think no no
[SPEAKER_03]: Durban poison itself is not a pure African
heirloom is best I am aware Durban is a
[SPEAKER_03]: place in South Africa that is a large
commercial area for cannabis for
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial so bee sters would be like
Durban and Swazi and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_03]: Durban poison if I remember correctly was
first released by Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be Durban land race skunk one No,
just like you're not gonna run into pure
[SPEAKER_03]: land race Durban poison There's not a
specific strain called urban poison Durban
[SPEAKER_03]: has all sorts of Different expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's an area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a strain So yeah, you're gonna
see all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, but man if you curl and talked
about where everyone Amsterdam got their
[SPEAKER_03]: Durban He said from a coffee shop same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a Durban coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where they got theirs They said
their Durban was different from the one
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel Frank provided Mel Frank's I believe
went to sensei and seed bank, but that's
[SPEAKER_03]: passion or not Dutch fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry SSSC super city works with a
totally different one and that interview
[SPEAKER_03]: was the first time we had ever heard that
and Yeah, like Durban tie high flight was
[SPEAKER_03]: wager finley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that's where this Durban Santa
Cruz rec is not gonna be restocked but we
[SPEAKER_03]: have the new version of it coming out with
higher I'm sorry with with Santa Cruz goat
[SPEAKER_03]: farm and it's gonna be the opposite It's
not it's instead of train wreck reversed
[SPEAKER_03]: on the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be blue dream reversed on the
train wreck So keep your eyes peeled.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna have that probably next week
We're gonna say a high and goat farm high
[SPEAKER_07]: and go far and learn goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's that's what they have sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good lonesome lonesome goats
Lonesome goats Here's it here's what I see
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw What you guys think is better
of the old flavors of the new work
[SPEAKER_03]: creators are doing I Don't give a shit
about any of the new work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are doing the lessons with old
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said don't What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think is better the old
flavors or new work readers are doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like the combos of the stuff like
that's like the work that I get excited
[SPEAKER_08]: about is when I have some New Age cut like
the papaya cut that I always talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: like I love that I cut that goes around
from bloom seed co and Crossing that into
[SPEAKER_08]: all kinds of stuff has me really excited
into like older stuff like oh geez like in
[SPEAKER_08]: the bubba's and A sour cut we have a nice
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: I crossed it to Things like that,
you know, I don't have like actual like
[SPEAKER_08]: old old cuts like my old cuts
quote-unquote are all like mid 2k stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but Yeah, so like I actually really
like trying to introgress the traits that
[SPEAKER_08]: are from the old school into like a modern
frame and production model Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to hear from local here as well
just because he's got a you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's recently I feel had like a really
good
[SPEAKER_06]: Range of range of range of things that he
can look through So Yeah, I kind of know
[SPEAKER_06]: what I know I've seen to kind of stick
with things that are like older on a
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic timeline and You know,
I kind of seem to prefer those over a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of the newer hybrids You know,
like I do fuck with like some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: skittle s1 stuff the sherb, you know That
stuff is nice, but it's not as good I
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't know they're like for example like
that sweet pea stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean that shit's phenomenal Santa Cruz
Rick, I mean I would totally put that and
[SPEAKER_06]: you know and the old flavor realm And I
think that shit's pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: spectacular Yeah You have someone called
Luna in the chat shouting out you Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz Rick, I believe But yeah,
there you go Yeah, I've been smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: locals Santa Cruz retro it's good man,
it's really good and then the the electric
[SPEAKER_03]: boogaloo Appalachia aka dogshit Appalachia
from high and lonesome that shit's fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it smells like traditional old hazy
That's super cool Yeah, I dig it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch that I bookmarked up here
start number one tip for growing OG Cal
[SPEAKER_03]: Magbra, what else do we got?
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out any of you try and like your
stigma tried and true new stuff coming out
[SPEAKER_03]: to any of us have liked You guys go ahead
I Don't have much experience of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you say any new stuff that you've
liked that Like really kicks your boxes
[SPEAKER_08]: like other than the papaya I'm trying to
think I know there's a few we just have
[SPEAKER_08]: like so much stuff that rolls through Man
like nothing's coming to mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like actually new like when I think
new I think like gelato era like 2016
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and so like a lot of stuff that I
see now is just like honestly reworked
[SPEAKER_08]: versions of that and reworked flavors of
that and so I put it into the same exact
[SPEAKER_08]: category like there's a cut called white
peaches that goes around That's like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, it's a little peach estuary
gelato, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: But like my mind just automatically is
like, yeah nice gelato The permanent
[SPEAKER_08]: marker man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually fucking like it and every time
I get another door.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like some good shit For like two days
90 bro, I've been smoking it every night
[SPEAKER_08]: for a few weeks now That's how my first
jar was from that batch that I sent you
[SPEAKER_08]: but some batches from other facilities
that I think hold up a little better and
[SPEAKER_08]: so It's just it's it's funny man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just I love that permanent marker
smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure Yeah, what I do is I flavor it with
other stuff, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: So like I've been doing these mixers of
permanent marker in different zs ones,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is really nice I'll throw some og on
there for some extra potency, you know You
[SPEAKER_03]: find lives Brent lines bread under HBS can
misbehavior not express problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think anything I think the
question is actually just act asked wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's do you find that lines?
[SPEAKER_08]: Selected under HBS can misbehave not
expressed properly under LED and that I
[SPEAKER_08]: will 100% say fuck Yeah, bro, like I I've
been working with LEDs at scale since 2018
[SPEAKER_08]: or 2017 and It's been a non-stop battle
When you get an older cut to try and
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out how to do the settings because
you have like a lot of control and a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of instances and so Dialing in those
settings, especially for older cuts that
[SPEAKER_08]: were guaranteed selected under like
single-ended 600 watt HPS like they don't
[SPEAKER_08]: want to get hit with that, you know 800 to
1800 Micro moles of light, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so yeah Yeah, I don't run LEDs I would
know I You should with how fucking hot it
[SPEAKER_03]: is where you live bro, I know I just don't
he sponsors me with them and I'm a broke
[SPEAKER_08]: folk, you know, I'm or I own CMH and t5
and other CMH is I've run CMH with lower
[SPEAKER_08]: total wattage in hot areas too and I've
gotten really great expressions out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I like as well I haven't moved yet
because it was just as effective for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: but realistically with the heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely Yeah, especially with how
far they've come Someone asked about jaws.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jaws is a bit Mike one three eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you really mix HPS LED and UVB?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guarantee you it is better than
any of the individuals.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean, but let's UVB UVB is
just it's an another spectrum of UV light
[SPEAKER_08]: and so like you have to have special
fixtures for that and then a lot of times
[SPEAKER_08]: they'll have specific diodes like if you
have a if you look on like an LED bar that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're gonna see usually like blue white
and red diodes, but then there's gonna be
[SPEAKER_08]: some that look like there's no light
coming out of them But those are actually
[SPEAKER_08]: the UV diodes because you can't see UV
light That makes sense Yeah, I didn't I
[SPEAKER_03]: just I'm not familiar with lights like
that that's new to me that that's new tech
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what's up man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always wanted to do it I've done CMH
mixed with HPS but never LED mixed with
[SPEAKER_03]: HID lighting Yeah, I just LED was so
expensive when I was first looking into it
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was a part of that wave where when
LED first got it got sold to the community
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really expensive and it was all
that blur pull UFO light And like I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that that put a major dent on a lot of
people that like immediately jumped into
[SPEAKER_03]: it and spent a bunch of money like that
turned a lot of people off It's definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: taken until maybe the past few years for a
lot of people that that experienced that
[SPEAKER_08]: to even try it again Yeah, the blur pulls
not inherently bad though Like you guys
[SPEAKER_08]: have seen some of my pictures from the my
seed production room where they're like
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of pink Blur pull lights in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are like the GE like four foot
They're like giant one giant light bar,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what I mean that sits above a
four by eight and you have two of them
[SPEAKER_08]: over a four by eight and so it's kind of
like the Fluence razors.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like what comes to mind like compare
it to And so I've actually grow really
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking fireweed Like every time pollen
doesn't take I'm like, it would be some
[SPEAKER_08]: alright smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I don't actually find that high
nitrous smoke Coming off of a plant that
[SPEAKER_08]: was meant to be pollinated, but it didn't
take you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I actually haven't found that it's
really that bad if you care it,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like obviously if you put it in the yeah,
like it's not inherently bad and what I've
[SPEAKER_08]: noticed is that in like certain commercial
production methods and like setups You
[SPEAKER_08]: don't get gas is readily you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like gas is actually kind of a hard
expression to nail down in a giant
[SPEAKER_08]: facility And a lot of its genetics but
like I can take something that's like pure
[SPEAKER_08]: gas and make it not gassy by putting it
under our commercial pressure You know
[SPEAKER_08]: what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I bet and so when I grow it under
those with high nitro feed They're like
[SPEAKER_08]: the rankest nastiest most fuel a version
of themselves possible Gas is a hard one
[SPEAKER_03]: to lock down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you don't see a lot of gassy OG
either like people just growing it all
[SPEAKER_08]: midsy commercial Dude, yeah, that's why
I've not even I'm not even joking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have tested out probably like Ten
different og cuts recently under our
[SPEAKER_08]: method and like it's just doesn't it
doesn't do it And then I take every single
[SPEAKER_08]: one of those and if I put it in that that
seed production room, it's fucking Mwah
[SPEAKER_08]: the fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just like that home grow attention
and like maybe a feed difference But
[SPEAKER_08]: there's just so many different variables
between you know, like a hundred light
[SPEAKER_08]: room and a three light room or a four
light room Here's one anything anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: know anything about Pinscher Creek Kush
with the sea possibly the original green
[SPEAKER_03]: crack came out of indoor in southern
Albert.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no Alberta Canada green that's
not That Kush with the sea though,
[SPEAKER_03]: baby Yeah, you know like the first time I
heard that story like the first time I saw
[SPEAKER_03]: the cut of green crack it was called Kush
with the sea green Kush with the sea and
[SPEAKER_03]: during that time Cecil had Somehow told
someone he thought that was his cut and
[SPEAKER_03]: been renamed to green crack Later later
years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked and his cut of push with the sea
He said the skunky and green crack is not
[SPEAKER_03]: stunky at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mango And it was not a part of the
term profile of his coach so Cecil C does
[SPEAKER_00]: not have anything to do with green crack
Nor does like his coach with a C but that
[SPEAKER_03]: story seems to travel with it for a long
way I do know that the cut when it made it
[SPEAKER_03]: to California was because with this and
most people prefer to call it green Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: with the sea because The crack name was
not popular What leads you to believe
[SPEAKER_03]: green crack is a skunk one Mango how it
grows, you know a lot of skunk one skunk
[SPEAKER_07]: one dominant whatever it is Man just want
to point out that you're cutting out in
[SPEAKER_08]: little bits when you turn our head too far
I wanted to talk real quick just the back
[SPEAKER_08]: to the skunk one thing is that that papaya
is really similar to green crack and What
[SPEAKER_08]: it does is the same kind of thing as it's
the mango Sour candy kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it has a very prominent cheesy note to
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's in that background Beyond it's just
like general look too It's very like green
[SPEAKER_03]: crack skunk one is fuck like you have a
lot of experience with skunk one Here's
[SPEAKER_03]: another interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys know anything
about the PPP peona purple Paralyzer,
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's an original name.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't know about my peepee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the best story I've ever heard on it
was from Stacey Stacey Mueller from
[SPEAKER_03]: overgrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: He legit dude and he had some Where the
seeds were from Nederland purple indica
[SPEAKER_03]: And I if I remember correctly and I don't
want to misquote him cuz he's not one
[SPEAKER_03]: person I want to miss quote But I'll ask
him more about the the PPP and see if it
[SPEAKER_03]: has that relation because I don't really
know but I think that the peona peonia
[SPEAKER_03]: purple Paralyzer was somehow related that
nettle and purple if I remember correctly
[SPEAKER_03]: I Really want to get Stacy on for a show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you wear out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome just 250 here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was an older question from LSD about
I've read it's rare for let me put it on
[SPEAKER_07]: the screen I've read it's rare for
something to actually be 30 plus 30% plus
[SPEAKER_07]: THC and this is the biological threshold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can this number be changed in the plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean this has to do with like physical
limitations, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it depends on the parameters that
you put on the thought experiment,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it fully flowered?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the number one thing that I think
because I remember that I saw that
[SPEAKER_08]: question when we were coming through and I
think there's a question that was like
[SPEAKER_08]: just after it to or maybe it was a
different person maybe but Anyway,
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, I don't think there's like a real
threshold for all circumstances you know
[SPEAKER_08]: what I mean, but if you're talking about
like 63 day stuff flowered exactly to 63
[SPEAKER_08]: day I would put it like 30% plus or minus
3% you know what I mean and like a 10%
[SPEAKER_08]: margin of error is like pretty generous,
but that's like what I realistically
[SPEAKER_08]: expect out of like a selected really
bangin modern cut that's been selected for
[SPEAKER_08]: commercial production and also what's
happening right now is Testing labs are
[SPEAKER_08]: also getting a massive shakeup in
California specifically and so we're gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: see a lot of numbers drop right off the
fucking cliff is what I'm expecting in
[SPEAKER_08]: January because we've had to specifically
go to labs and be like Do not give us some
[SPEAKER_08]: bullshit fucking numbers, you know,
and so like when I'm submitting super
[SPEAKER_08]: large samples I'll see everything from 13%
to 37% You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's like well, they weren't lying
on the 13% one You know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_08]: or maybe that was actually 8% So you never
really know and so these really strict
[SPEAKER_08]: testing standards and the state producing
their own like sample testing standards as
[SPEAKER_08]: far as like this one milligram is one
milligram of HLPC to like run into an HLPC
[SPEAKER_08]: machine It's like gonna change the game as
far as like what these labs are allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: do to fudge the numbers, too Oh,
yeah, I mean realistically just look at it
[SPEAKER_03]: from any kind of like economical
perspective Am I too loud now?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay if you pay a place to give you tests
and there's a bunch of places that do this
[SPEAKER_03]: testing and the people that want the
highest number or the highest 50% sells
[SPEAKER_03]: the best at each collective.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna be going to the lab that
gives them the highest That is common
[SPEAKER_03]: sense and that's what's happened to me
like it just obvious I had a different
[SPEAKER_07]: angle into this which was thinking about
it from the point of view of like physical
[SPEAKER_07]: constraints in terms of like cannabinoid
balance from like the plants physiology
[SPEAKER_07]: point of view any thoughts on that like
Maybe local or Dan, can you ask it again?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was reading some comments that are
fucking ignorant as fuck This question
[SPEAKER_07]: about 30% plus THC from the point of view
of like physiological constraints or
[SPEAKER_07]: physical constraints in the plant It's the
max Alan You always find outliers in
[SPEAKER_08]: populations for every single trait and so
like what I think about it is like say
[SPEAKER_08]: that an average my skittles s1s have 2%
Terp expression there are outliers that
[SPEAKER_08]: are three and a half almost four percent
in there and that's just an upregulated
[SPEAKER_08]: gene that expresses more of the exact same
thing and so It's it's all preference that
[SPEAKER_08]: number doesn't mean it's gonna get you
more high, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I hate about THC numbers the
most is people get so caught up in like
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a physiological limit to how high
it can be and I'm like no, I think there's
[SPEAKER_08]: more a physiological limit that THC isn't
the only thing that affects the high,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even a limit It's just like a
condition and so it's like if you have one
[SPEAKER_08]: out of the eight things that get you high
and it's in this super upregulated
[SPEAKER_08]: environment where the plants not producing
any of these secondary cannabinoids and it
[SPEAKER_08]: can all go into THC if it's not producing
any Secondary aroma compounds it can all
[SPEAKER_08]: all that energy can go into just THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that make better weed?
[SPEAKER_08]: I genuinely don't think so, but I think
it's more the statement is faulty More
[SPEAKER_08]: than the premise, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about this comment?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's the one I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew it was Yeah 27% tops.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there's a That's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like chem 91 lays out most people but
it'll test at 18 or less You know what I
[SPEAKER_08]: mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe 20% if you take it at the right time
But you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's not the thing the only thing
that affects and modulates the high that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're feeling and highs are different
forever And so like we've talked about
[SPEAKER_08]: this a million times where like some
things give certain people absolute panic
[SPEAKER_08]: attacks and other people are like that's
what I smoke to chill the fuck out at the
[SPEAKER_08]: end of the day and so brain chemistry I
think is honestly way more important than
[SPEAKER_08]: any of these numbers because like I met a
dude at work who he can eat a thousand
[SPEAKER_08]: milligrams of edibles and Like be fully
functioning and go to the bar and have
[SPEAKER_08]: drinks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just doesn't affect him You know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: If I eat a thousand mil I'd be in the
psych ward for three fucking days Right
[SPEAKER_06]: guaranteed bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah Yeah, I mean I work in that
field like the QA stuff There's a range
[SPEAKER_06]: for sure The most I'll see is like look 31
32 percent, you know And that's rare The
[SPEAKER_06]: quality of the weed though is like fucking
trash that's what I'm saying That's kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of what I'm getting at too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I you know it I bring it back to
like people always talk about like the
[SPEAKER_03]: entourage effect Oh, it's this trip
actually modulating that high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're getting so fucking high
You know, like it gave me an eight
[SPEAKER_03]: percenter, but that turf is what's doing
it I've had weed like the the old Afghan
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush cut that was that coming out of
Michigan it had no scent no taste like
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing, but it would fuck you up and it
wasn't super high testing in THC It was
[SPEAKER_03]: not super terpy that any I could sense it
was Smelled like literally like nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: another plant that I had like this then I
could smell similar was the menthol and I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't get to smoke that but This was a
plant that for sure had really no defining
[SPEAKER_03]: sense it was very much a Like a blanket
cardboard turp, but it was it had such a
[SPEAKER_03]: great high I don't know how you explain
that kind of high using the entourage
[SPEAKER_03]: effect type theory other than maybe it's
different cannabinoids that don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: certain smells or tastes and a lot of
people attribute it to just turps or just
[SPEAKER_03]: flavonoids and I don't even think that's
just the answer I don't even think that
[SPEAKER_08]: we've identified all the psychoactive
compounds that even compose I don't I mean
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, like if we really think about
cannabis It's like working off of these
[SPEAKER_08]: like carbon ring structures and it'll
produce if you look at terpenes if you
[SPEAKER_08]: look at cannabinoids It's literally almost
like it's every single possible iteration
[SPEAKER_08]: of side chains off of this Five-carbon
ring kind of thing or I'm not even I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: a chemist.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like I don't whatever whatever
that is You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And but if you can look at them all and
look at a chart of all the chemical
[SPEAKER_08]: structures and you're like It seems like
it's every single possible iteration,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And this plant has this mechanism or like
it's incentivized to produce every single
[SPEAKER_08]: possible secondary metabolite that it
possibly can because we like it,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and so I just think that the
possibility space is like immense It's
[SPEAKER_08]: immense.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and like terpenes are literally just
like one type of aromatic compound You
[SPEAKER_08]: know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we've heard that on the show a
couple times too, or it's just like You
[SPEAKER_08]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's just I don't think we have any
understanding whatsoever about how this
[SPEAKER_08]: plant affects our mind and our body's
physiology I think that that level of
[SPEAKER_08]: understanding is like literally we've
scratched the surface and we're like,
[SPEAKER_08]: oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah THC gets you high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah CBG is for inflammation and I'm
like if you think about that, that's like
[SPEAKER_08]: how a like Instagram influencer like
momfluencer type like talks about
[SPEAKER_08]: essential oils And like that shit is like
the sketchiest level of Yeah, like sweet
[SPEAKER_08]: pizza said 400 different cannabinoids we
test for five to seven You know what I
[SPEAKER_08]: mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And nobody even looks at anything but THC
and CBD Like I have to go out of my way on
[SPEAKER_08]: a test to click more links to expand View
to even see CBG or CBC.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and so and and those aren't even
psychoactive So like I just think that
[SPEAKER_08]: like when people get hung up on THC
numbers I'm like you've missed the whole
[SPEAKER_08]: picture.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's when in like what local was saying is
like when I see a 35% tester I don't think
[SPEAKER_08]: like I am gonna get fucked up when I smoke
this I'm gonna be like, yeah, it's gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: be some kind of trashy smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, you know what I mean when I see
something mid 20s with a high turf
[SPEAKER_08]: profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like that's gonna be Tasty as fuck,
you know, and even then it's not always
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen stuff with 4% turps that didn't
really smell that good How often do you
[SPEAKER_03]: see THC V never?
[SPEAKER_08]: And my new my new amounts constantly but
never above like a threshold of a tenth of
[SPEAKER_08]: a milligram To like a third of a milligram
per gram sample CBG is much more common
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the most and CBC as well and just
like CBC is kind of in between prevalence,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, but It's They even care about
CBN anymore I don't I don't see CBN ever
[SPEAKER_08]: on tests.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a category on there But it's
almost always nondetect and the the lines
[SPEAKER_08]: that I work And so I have some stuff that
I wish I could work at scale at my job But
[SPEAKER_08]: there's no commercial value to it without
like years of work and like thousands of
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds grown and popped like it's it would
be the way to do that would be on a
[SPEAKER_08]: sun-grown farm like in a Field,
you know because then I could pop 10,000
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds and at the end of the day we're
extracting it all but like I can pull out
[SPEAKER_08]: samples that I want tested and we can do
something like a Mobile HPLC and start
[SPEAKER_08]: getting like a quicker cheaper sample so
we can actually test 10,000 of them and
[SPEAKER_03]: not pay 50 bucks a sample This is what
I've worked in cannabinoid isolation and
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery or can I don't even know how to
pronounce that still I think it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: unlikely that a psychoactive cannabinoid
exists that has such a low EC 50 that we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know About it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not that we don't know about it,
but that we don't test for it and any
[SPEAKER_08]: meaningful way Yeah, and so it basically
doesn't exist to anyone that that would be
[SPEAKER_08]: working it anyway, you know That's kind of
more what I'm getting at is like there's
[SPEAKER_08]: an immense amount of cannabinoids and we
test for five to seven You know and most
[SPEAKER_08]: of those show up in my new trace amounts
in almost the whole working commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: population at large and so There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's kind of what I've heard I've
also heard things from like chimera that
[SPEAKER_08]: like when he looks at lab tests he can
tell when people are misinterpreting
[SPEAKER_08]: results for cannabinoids and kind of like
extenuating or You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean interpreting analysis wrong because
they can't tell the difference between
[SPEAKER_08]: certain cannabinoids And so I just like
don't trust labs at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a marketing tool more than anything I
don't need to have a lab tell me if weed
[SPEAKER_08]: is good or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna smoke them all anyway Yeah,
there was there was a Here's here's the
[SPEAKER_03]: one my head up any of you had experience
with cobs are otherwise fermented in aged
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis Yeah, I fucking not burped a
turkey bag before And from pit and then I
[SPEAKER_03]: got to smoke cob at the last gathering
that we had and It makes nice big dark
[SPEAKER_03]: clouds of smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more fucked up it didn't make me
anything I did frankly it didn't cut
[SPEAKER_08]: through the high of any other shit that I
was I can really smell in like gelato type
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff too when People don't dry and cure
properly because it really does get this
[SPEAKER_08]: very specific I the the the people that
used to buy for me would call it pissy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really piss, but it's this like I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this weird take on It's a weird take
on kind of gelato eat herbs and it's the
[SPEAKER_08]: fermented version and it's from the year
that I did not burp Not at least enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Someone just called themselves out for
being a clown.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool We I reckon we start wrapping
up we're coming to the end of two hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah fuck Maybe just the fun just the
fun everyone in the comments right what
[SPEAKER_07]: you smoking today tonight And also get
your last questions in yeah also like if
[SPEAKER_03]: there's anything we talked about you
disagree with or anything else You wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to add that we didn't get to show your
thing Be sure to go to the video
[SPEAKER_03]: afterwards leave it in the comments there
We always check those and I go back and
[SPEAKER_03]: respond to people there And yeah,
that's always fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like I like the after comments and to
see what people thought of the episode so
[SPEAKER_03]: Please go leave a comment like subscribe
all that fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even point you that out this time
They're like this dude Dan the douche.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a doosher man.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a chat fucking asshole Our dub I love
sour dub dude, that's that's one I would
[SPEAKER_08]: like to see again Early skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that smoke some early pearl skunk
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's silver pearl
[SPEAKER_08]: That image that is a fucked-looking
pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my lord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Anything else that we should cover?
[SPEAKER_07]: Came on the show the last season.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah Yeah, that's right because we
most of our episodes ended up being You
[SPEAKER_07]: know involve people from our crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out To high and lonesome spindle

[SPEAKER_01]: thank you up here did we get go to y'all
What was that sorry Not this season Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: that might have been last time yeah He's
got a much better complete list
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure banger I missed Sure banger here in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you imagine smoking something called
pure mission?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like one of those things,
you know, like if you ever been to
[SPEAKER_08]: Michigan hurts, yeah Wow, I never were
like I never understood that cut it's kind
[SPEAKER_08]: Of like the came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember around the same time as like
the Oreos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think yeah Johnny come lately bullshit
to me like GKB was done in 2012 bro,
[SPEAKER_03]: like all this other bullshit that came out
after late to the table Johnny come
[SPEAKER_03]: lately's there was shit done better
Earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no respect for any of the dudes
that came in like ten years after OG KB
[SPEAKER_03]: showed up and thought they were doing
something no respect It's one of those
[SPEAKER_08]: ones too where I'm like, where'd you get
it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never come across it a single time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never even met anyone that's held it
like Well, I concurrently like while I
[SPEAKER_03]: knew them and so All right, I'm what else
we got you got anything you want to say
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan or look anything No, man, I'm chillin
fucking I don't know everybody smoke some
[SPEAKER_08]: weed for me tonight.
