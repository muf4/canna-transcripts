[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's that handsome man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got done with dinner with the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you spritz your hair?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not spritz?
[SPEAKER_00]: No spritz.
[SPEAKER_00]: No spritz.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shave.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would we consider the topic tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we could chat a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about the changing seed
dynamic and how it's been one way for
[SPEAKER_00]: every 5 or 10 years or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of dramatically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially since in today's world,
there's a ton of stuff now that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out that's old and authentic and this and
that and unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people might not know that even
stuff 10 years ago is hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we could chat about how it
changed, how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take questions on this one pretty
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of years to cover,
so it's not like you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: chronological even or go into tons of
depth on everything, but we can give a
[SPEAKER_00]: general overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already questions about the NL
repro and Hawaiian lights and this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, when you hear skunk 1,
or you hear NL, or you hear this or that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even sour diesel for some people,
it might be a legendary thing of old that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're hearing about, but you might have
come up in an era where it wasn't popular
[SPEAKER_00]: or common.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of information out there
about certain things, but it needs to get
[SPEAKER_00]: taught again and again and again and
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it seems to need to be refreshed
more often now than ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a multitude of people coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always been dishonesty in the seed
game, but there's dishonesty and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: sleight of hand and there's letting people
assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assumptions are a big one where you're not
actually lying necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lying by omission.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just throwing it out there and
being like, oh, well, you assumed that,
[SPEAKER_00]: not me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could just do a super quick
overview of what things were like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your era.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my era.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already done some long podcasts on
this, so I won't touch on it too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the parts that are important for
people to know is that in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was only a few companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversals and all that were years and
years and years away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was not very much
competition, there wasn't very much
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure to change things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies would come out with a lineup and
that lineup would often stay the same
[SPEAKER_00]: within a mission or an addition or two
over a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed bank from Neville changed every
couple of years as he figured out what he
[SPEAKER_00]: had going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first five years of Sensei were
basically the same stuff, unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every year or two, they'd add a new
thing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Simon from Sirius Seeds came out,
he was pretty famous for having,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had the same six things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty common back then where it
was like most of the companies that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could buy from were out of Holland because
that's where it was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all had printed catalogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really internet or internet
was very young.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest difference from today is that
they all used males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look back at that early work,
they typically found males that worked for
[SPEAKER_00]: them and repeatedly used them across
multiple lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them, it might sound crazy today,
but the older breeders would tell you that
[SPEAKER_00]: the males were the most valuable cuts and
they're stable because the females,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could obviously grow the flower and
you could decide whether or not you liked
[SPEAKER_00]: it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males figuring out whether or not they
passed the traits that you wanted was time
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either a roll of the dice and you
got very lucky or extremely time
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to make seeds and grow the seeds
and be like, oh, that's not the male I
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go to a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, breeders, when they figured out
an actual male that was golden for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they hung on to it like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the thing, we were talking in the
beginning about olden strains popping back
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the skunk one and the NL and this
and that and everything else, is that some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the reasons why these strains were so
famous is because unlike today where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a ton of breeders releasing new
names, all the time and they're there and
[SPEAKER_00]: gone, these things had lasting power.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hung around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw their names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, if you bought a seed pack,
usually the following, if you chose to buy
[SPEAKER_03]: another one the next year, it would be a
similar seed pack, the same kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when the Canadians and stuff and
other companies started biting that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial stuff, they still use those
initial names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why some of
those names have such, for lack of a
[SPEAKER_00]: better term, name recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with casual smokers, most smokers
have probably never smoked pure Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights anything, but everybody's heard it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people really haven't, honestly,
probably even haven't smoked skunk one
[SPEAKER_00]: pure, even though it's in lots of things,
but they've heard the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was how it was for a really long time
was that there was different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say for the first 15 years,
it was almost all Holland,
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 85 to 2,000 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty Amsterdam-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the late 90s, early 2000s,
it started shifting over to Canada too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of different groups from
Canada, Federation and- Legends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legends and BZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the cool things about Canada was
that before, when I first started,
[SPEAKER_00]: you either had to fly to Amsterdam or you
had to get mail from Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there was Canadian seed companies
that started opening up in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you could get it from Canada,
which was a lot more mail back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: between our two countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot more lost in the shuffle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Mark Emory, the one that was
famous for a minute was Heaven's Stairway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all tied into the first forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brother, Ron, are you Jim's brother,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronnie God?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing a really good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Jim's sister, and I knew Jim really
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of my mentors, so that's pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never talked to his brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go back to not paying
attention to comments, but I will pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hard to chit chat and read at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lose my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the amazing things about the
Canadian seed companies is that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: individual companies like Sensei or
something in Canada that were making
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, but there was also the first seed
brokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in Amsterdam days, you went to each
individual seed company and got seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mark Emory or Heaven's Seven Stairway,
these groups, you could get all of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: supposedly, plus all this stuff from
Canada.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important about that, too,
is that the Canadian people, it really
[SPEAKER_00]: widened what was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was different people, like Reefer
Man was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was various people that started
throwing out all kinds of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short shifted his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: After not being very happy, I don't think,
with partnering with Dutch guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was at Sag Martha first and
then went to Dutch Passion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he pretty much started mostly selling
his stuff through Canadian companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still all male's era.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened in the late 90s with
Overgrow and with Cannabis World is now
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden, like you talk about IG,
there was the potential for people to get
[SPEAKER_00]: internet famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some people that were on there
early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't dissing them, so don't take it
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because there was only so much
competition and there was only so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people willing to do what they were doing
publicly, they got famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the whole first edition of,
you know, people started posting on
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow threads with Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Blueberry is pretty close to
Matt's heart, you know, and people would
[SPEAKER_00]: freak out because it looked so different
than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wildly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another part of it where it's
like, that's the start of where things
[SPEAKER_00]: started getting internet famous and
everybody started talking about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like one percent of people that were
talking about them had ever seen it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag or smoked it or smelled it or touched
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just online vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just online vision and online talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could get a couple of people
that sounded intelligent talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was gospel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I used to go on there
and people would have grow forums and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, growing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing was like the original
Brothers Grammar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right in that same era.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since Cinderella, 99 Blueberry stuff
with catchy names that was new,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't from Amsterdam, wasn't from the
same group, was different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of got super famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of, you know, as far as like
tonight's discussion or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's kind of important about it is that
in the beginning, it was literally like SS
[SPEAKER_00]: C and Neville selling seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was like 12 Dutch dudes
selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was like 20 Dutch dudes
selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a bunch of Canadians
making seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was like some aggregators
of seed in Canada selling seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Internet comes along and all
of a sudden somebody from Oregon like DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Short or, you know, Brothers Grammar,
these different people could just pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was Breed Bay the first?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it was it like probably like direct
messages in the very beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was the easiest way for people to
communicate and actually get seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more down in the DM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes down in the DM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the forums, the forums was
really the first place where sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the worldwide weed community could start
to chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's where a lot of legends were born.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's also where the people that
are legends started writing down versions
[SPEAKER_00]: of events that we could compare to what
they say and wrote later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the forums is where a lot of the real
story of Skunk One first got told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real and we talked about it with Chem
Dog on the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where people started writing down
thoughts about Chem Dog and the original
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people could find they
could be active on threads and they could
[SPEAKER_00]: find other people and you could start
learning about sort of like the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: weed history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times we'd see people growing
the clone and be like, fuck, I want that
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd go talk to them and you'd make
connections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's that's how it all
worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how the circle started.
[SPEAKER_03]: The clone circles of people, you know,
kind of banding together as crews because
[SPEAKER_03]: they realized, like, I've got to keep
honest people around me to trade with
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm getting fucked all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was people like, you know,
there's people that are Instagram famous
[SPEAKER_00]: right now in weed world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was definitely people that were,
you know, forum famous and their opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: their opinions about seed and their
opinions about all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's where, like a lot of
times for some people, the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: people saw old timers start arguing with
youngsters over what the fuck even was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize some of the personalities
behind some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like Tom Hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Vic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chimera and all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera Chimera, who, you know,
Matt interviewed him and read a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he he's actually really
personable to watch talk, but he was like
[SPEAKER_00]: the most intimidating breeder to read
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because his level of like technical
knowledge and education on how genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: work is pretty deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really hard to argue with him very
hard because he could he could run circles
[SPEAKER_03]: around people's science wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he just he just he's you know,
he just he breeding and genetics and how
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff works.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a you could call it like a
classical education in it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and he got hella famous,
but it's like nobody I never tried any of
[SPEAKER_00]: his weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never tried any of his strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying like, you know,
like I said, some of the stuff like with
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry and stuff like how many people
actually tried the blue velvet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not many.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so expensive back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the more expensive strains
for its time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so a lot of people weren't
buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so people would like live
vicariously through like the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: did buy it and they'd start a grow journal
on some forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like that would drive seed sales
for certain ones like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here's this crazy purple blue like
long before cookies or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the blue family really did look
unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're going to do a whole set
segment for people watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do a whole segment on the
history of purples, because I think
[SPEAKER_03]: nowadays looking around, you see all the
purples and you think, well, this must
[SPEAKER_03]: have been how it always has been.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it just wasn't like purples were rare
as fuck up until 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't seeing a lot of true breeding
purples that you could you could breed
[SPEAKER_03]: with and reliably pass on purple traits or
only a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, in 2008, what Matt's talking
about those purples that started popping
[SPEAKER_00]: were kind of all descendants from half a
dozen purple cuts that got famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them were descendants of Mendo
perps, because Blackberry is probably a
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo perps, you know, and Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority were Blackberry or purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oracle Oracle and Mendo P kind of created
a million hybrids.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I mean, just we're going to
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we will do a whole show on that,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we definitely will.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an aspect to it where,
like, in general, people should still know
[SPEAKER_00]: that, like from, you know, so now
everyone, all those people still had
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roan Dogg.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he will never be on this show because
he's been taught too many lies about his
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking herbal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll fill you in later, Roan Dogg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't let that one slide by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, like, I'm still not,
you know, and so so basically like just
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping it with the seed game or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone still use males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it all of a sudden it was really
it was almost like democracy and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be like an aristocracy of
seed companies that like they they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have very much competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they didn't have very much
new things coming in to like sort of turn
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stuff like NL that gets famous and all
was sold for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, you know, I mean, skunk one,
these, you know, hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These various different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like new things would hit like
we talked about the white family and the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue family a little bit last episode,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things had five or six years of a
run where they didn't have very much else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hype is battling them for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eyes and drool and, you know, oh,
my God, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what the forums did is they introduced
the ability for small scale growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start selling seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, you really had to like,
you know, I mean, even for someone like DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Short to sell his blue line, he basically
had to send it to Dutch companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first started, I had to send it to
at that time, it was mostly British
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that were doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had to send it fucking front it
all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just had to hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: That someone wasn't going to fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so you and so basically then
the Internet allowed some of these seed
[SPEAKER_00]: people to sell direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and to create their own seat,
you know, in a way where that sort of I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to think of like who else was,
you know, Breeder Steve got really famous
[SPEAKER_00]: in that same era because there was a thing
where, you know, once they started
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the laws in Holland in ninety
nine, where they didn't allow seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production, Switzerland opened up big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was these there was these,
you know, there was these forum posts and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff about Swiss grows and people like
Breeder Steve and Shanti Baba and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other people that had made the switch
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, like now it's like,
oh, whatever, I see another huge 20 acre
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Da da da da da.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just scrolling through I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, the jungle boys are building
another fucking warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing like seven greenhouses lined up in
a row that were commercially scaled full
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed in Switzerland, all of a sudden
you were like, whoa, yeah, it's not in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were actually able to breed over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it was kind of like,
can you think of anybody else besides like
[SPEAKER_00]: Brothers Grimm?
[SPEAKER_03]: The DJ Short Breeder Steve, you know what
I was just thinking as you were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: with was that what I really remember was
that nobody from Europe was selling
[SPEAKER_03]: direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were very few.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you were someone that was a
well-known breeder, you weren't able to
[SPEAKER_03]: buy seeds like from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't able to buy from Nirvana
Direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't able to buy from Shanti
Direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would not ship to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's why everybody had to go through
these these other venues of the of the one
[SPEAKER_03]: spot, whether it was Seabay, Heaven
Stairway onto Seed Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Seed Boutique, places like that
before you could even get your hands on
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody was buying direct from the
breeders back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one was doing direct seed sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got sketched by what happened in
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I went out in the 90s when I was
going like you basically most of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to go and get seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to go there and get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were shipping it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Heaven Stairway and Mark Emery and
places like that, they would ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then they and all of a
sudden you could like you'd get Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Culture, which was Mark Emery's magazine
or Hite, you know, and that that thing was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most donors bought it because it
had some cool pictures and a few cool
[SPEAKER_00]: articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it would have pages of his seed
company and what the offerings were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would just read those paragraphs
over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some good copywriting in some of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, Federation or,
you know, Casey Brains or this or that and
[SPEAKER_00]: these new names and with new names came
new claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the the Dutch started
losing their their place of like
[SPEAKER_00]: centrality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that also started to speed
things up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most famous strains had kind of
an arc of I would call it like five to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight years where they were dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think that was true with
like like I said, like with skunk and now
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was true with White Widow and
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was true with, you know,
I mean, you remember all the hype about
[SPEAKER_00]: like like Cindy 99, Cinderella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, well, yeah, I mean, a fast,
fast flowering haze, supposedly haze type
[SPEAKER_03]: high that you could grow outdoors and
finish in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like what DJ used to claim
about flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seven weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the qualities you want in a long
running equatorial situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Cindy 99 was kind of the same
thing, but it was more like eight or nine
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and also we should probably note
that whatever whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way to put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: DMS and the Internet really started people
all of a sudden being able to trade clones
[SPEAKER_00]: with people they didn't know personally in
real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was kind of a revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's when a lot of these Cali
clones that were Cali clone only started
[SPEAKER_00]: to make their way around the nation,
you know, because you really had to be
[SPEAKER_00]: connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really had to be connected in order to
get things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you generally speaking,
like you had to go meet someone to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where all of a sudden,
I mean, it sounds quaint now, but like
[SPEAKER_00]: people could like go make Internet
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do some private DMing and all of a
sudden they got some cuts mails.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that that to me has been lost from
from what's going on today.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the most part, not always,
but for the most part, a lot of people pop
[SPEAKER_03]: in and expect to just be given,
you know, just be given.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pay your dues.
[SPEAKER_03]: You work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You work your way into certain circles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gain trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a several year time thing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the I would say that that
probably is true, like in any like small
[SPEAKER_00]: subculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the the ability for, you know,
for the people that are already in it to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of lay down the law, the rules and
like the the you know what conduct is
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, I could use like I'm a
little young for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of my older deadhead friends told
me the worst thing that ever happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: the dead was when they had a top 10 hit in
1987, because so many that's a prop
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so many people started coming to the
show that like 95 percent of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: going there knew sort of the framework of
the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get two, three, four or five
hundred thousand people that start showing
[SPEAKER_00]: up at all these different spots in
different places and they don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing has happened with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there used to be a thing where I
mean, 20 years ago, there wasn't anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: offering like, hey, I've got all these
rare cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's three hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's five hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's eight hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no one would ever trade with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you made if you made a price list for
clones back then, you would probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: blacklisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every collector would be like,
oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people just look at it like,
oh, it's a perfectly acceptable business
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can just gather up all these clones
and I'm not even making a value judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that back then,
like that would have been crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had to build trust with some and
they would usually extract some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: concession that you would treat it in a
way that they felt was respectful in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they saw that, they probably
wouldn't trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you posted on Overgrow or Cannabis
World or something like or ICMAG later,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you posted some, hey, here's the 20
cuts that I'm selling and here's the price
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be super fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be fucked, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like you people would be jumping
down your throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would be flipping out because it
was it was like a lot of those things were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of considered like family heirlooms
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but what's cool about that is
that that revolutionized breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like one of the things that like,
you know, Neville got so lucky when he did
[SPEAKER_00]: was he got all these American breeders to
just give him their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very lucky in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like he got to cross skunk in
an hour and he got to cross haze in an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour and he got to cross, you know,
all this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, DMS and trading that went on in
the forums that started really like
[SPEAKER_00]: changing up what what growers and breeders
could have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they could use and people mailing
each other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was even more that was way more
common than I think clone trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way, way, way more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like clone trading was still pretty rare
and sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people would be like, oh, I took this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took this sweet tooth and I crossed it
to these eight things that I have and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send them to all my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone mailing is also a huge pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it always has been, you know,
it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just super rare, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think trading seeds was more we were
still like in this in the you pop seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just think I think in general,
sending clones was so much labor,
[SPEAKER_03]: so much more laborious.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were so many there were so few
people that had legit shit and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: easier to track who had what back then
than it is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were there were all kinds of
factors that went into why seeds were much
[SPEAKER_03]: easier to ship and why they were more
traded than clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was more emphasis on seeds back
then anyways than clones market wise,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think before the mid 2000s, there was a
lot less emphasis on like, I have this
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strain and it sells for this
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow a lot of good things and it
would still easily sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were much more they were much
more content with like, oh, send me 30
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and I'll find a winner and then I'm
going to grow it my little group and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have no problem moving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big issue, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is is that as the last the last
15 years, it's gotten more and more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more specific on, do you have this cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I think that era that we're talking
about, it was more people were way more
[SPEAKER_00]: into like finding seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in that era, you are more likely
to get a real cut because the whole fake
[SPEAKER_00]: cut thing hadn't really taken off yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, there was there was no nobody
sold any.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no money in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no reason to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like there was fake cuts getting
traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like anything else, it takes a long
time for that stuff to snowball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, because you have someone has to
grow it out, figure it out that it's fake
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place, go through enough
hands to be caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, it's like, so you got a
fake or two or whatever, like getting
[SPEAKER_00]: traded back and forth here and there to
one or two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fast forward 10 years and the
game changes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's 30 people trading that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just get into way more hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always honestly like that's more
Matt's era than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that I was way more of a
lurker because I didn't trust technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a like to I didn't trust technology
to DM people and to give out my address
[SPEAKER_00]: and to send me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was I was in the era where people still
weren't selling direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, why the fuck are people
selling direct?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to sell direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was probably a very, very risky
idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't realize it at the time how
indeed risky it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured more people would do it than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a risky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I just like I just didn't
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I thought like with the push of a
button, the FBI could just find my VPN and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're also male phobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I would do things like I would
go to Amsterdam, you know, and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like put seeds, sew them in the hem of my
jeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like twice a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like and I would make these like tiny
little notes with like like prison notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the smallest lettering, like the
little guys and NL five skunk one,
[SPEAKER_00]: this tiny little note.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd slip that in the hem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd push the 30 seeds in there
and sew it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's like actual like
smuggling in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was just thinking how bad it
would suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you got home and you forgot to
tell your mom not to wash your jeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your jeans with your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was buying, I moved out soon,
you know, early on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't there wasn't any like come
home with illegal seeds to my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was your male significant
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to get really annoyed at how like
the last day you were in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would like take you would get a new
hotel room and you would take everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in your bag out one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would look for like weed leafs or
a small or a small chunk of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would make sure you wandered all your
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I have a buddy,
you know, I've talked about him before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, he had a he had a wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wallet had a Velcro seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the tiniest flake of weed was
sticking to the Velcro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he went through customs,
they looked through his shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like the tiniest tiniest flake
of, you know, it was like a sweet leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: that was stuck to the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it stuck to the Velcro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was like we had a two hour
delay because then they ripped apart
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in his life and they like
looked at the soles of your shoes and they
[SPEAKER_00]: like image the bottom of his suitcase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like they were they were on
him like white on rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet from one little flake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then back then we were
sketched enough because you were flying
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we would do this thing where we
would go to Holland, but we would fly home
[SPEAKER_00]: from like Germany or Belgium or France.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it was like a direct flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily straight from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going to be looked at way
more heavy coming out of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's like, yeah, it's like
you're flying home from like a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like it's like in the 80s,
you're flying home from Bogota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're exactly sunglasses,
you know, like you might get looked at for
[SPEAKER_00]: a minute, you know, because it's Bogota,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it basically like it took a lot
of effort then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I think the forum is really sort
of like democratized and made the effort
[SPEAKER_00]: easier because you could like hunt shit
from your living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and unlike today, I mean,
I like we I've made some comments before
[SPEAKER_00]: about like IG being irritating me because,
you know, people curate their page so hard
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of good information gets lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people will just block you or
delete your comment or even just take down
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole post.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the you know, it goes off, it goes off
kilter for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even my my catalog posts have
been flagged and taken down just pictures
[SPEAKER_03]: of cat pages from catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people have access to see what was in
the catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even those get reported and taken down,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early days, the only way that
you could get something taken down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: forum is if the moderator you knew the
moderator and they were willing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something shady and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, the worst thing that used
to happen on the forums was if people got
[SPEAKER_00]: too mean to each other, they would just
lock comments, lock the threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just lock the thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thread, the information itself
would stay up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there was like a generation of
people that grew up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I mean, I talked I've talked a few
times about like those harvest festivals
[SPEAKER_00]: that I went to a whole bunch of people,
you know, from from Ron and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those people met from the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was like groups of friends
from different regions, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, I mean, that's the first
place I met CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by Ron, you mean NCGA for everybody
watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: NCGA, North Cal Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to they used to throw in Sonoma
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to rent out a house for three
days and basically have a harvest festival
[SPEAKER_00]: that was catered where everybody would
bring down seeds and weed and hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: their stuff and shoot the shit,
eat and talk about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's where a lot a whole
bunch of us, even though like CSI and I
[SPEAKER_00]: only lived a couple hours apart,
that's where we met.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was people like like Chip
who started the cocoa that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, he started a co-soil
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mendo Royal Royal Gold from Royal
Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a podcast now and I think he's in
Colorado or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, like, you know, I met Chip
there and he, you know, he was just back
[SPEAKER_00]: from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a bunch of, you know,
pictures of all these greenhouses full of
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like those kind of things
brought together a bunch of breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what really started like the
poly hybrid era where people started being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to trade their stuff back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start crossing things to different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, I've got this little bit because
most of the time back then you got two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three cuts that your friends grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all you had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe, you know, it's like,
yeah, like if Matt was if Matt was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in San Diego or some shit, then he could
get things in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wasn't going to get things that
were famous in New York or Florida or it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not during that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not during that era at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, Matt made the point now
where people like want access to all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't realize how many years of
just being around and being trusted it
[SPEAKER_00]: took before someone would start to let you
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take I compare it a lot to like if
people are familiar with tattoo shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: how when you want to be a tattoo artist,
the first place you start is with the
[SPEAKER_03]: broom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start with the broom and you sweep the
tattoo parlor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can do this for six months to
fucking 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's all based on when you gain the
trust for someone to take an interest in
[SPEAKER_03]: you and be like, I'm going to show you a
trade because I think you're worth worth
[SPEAKER_03]: showing this to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to invest time in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to return that by helping
me, you know, apprentice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was a much more of like an
apprentice situation in a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: things when it came to trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, too, that was how seeds were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you go back, you know,
why did you know after Neville left
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei, for instance, why did he partner
with Shanti?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanti was probably younger and more
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he kind of took him under his
wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of that that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of people that trained
people coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you learn from someone above
you and, you know, I mean, Simon and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's this fuck Adam, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tony, you know, so Adam from TH seeds,
Simon from serious seeds and Tony from Sag
[SPEAKER_00]: Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they all worked under Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they learned enough and they
learned what the fuck they were doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: they learned how to breed and they worked
for him for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they started their own company
called Cerebral.
[SPEAKER_03]: And me, I like I was talking about earlier
with Ronnie Dogg, I learned from Jimbo,
[SPEAKER_03]: who he was referred to as his brother,
but was like his uncle or cousin or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned under him, you know,
like and he was not it was not an easy
[SPEAKER_03]: person to learn under.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I learned a lot, you know,
and later on learned a little bit under
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get lucky sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still learn a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even even this far in my career,
I'm learning a ton under CSI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just it's it's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 20 years, 20 years ago when I was
in my early 20s or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could go on the Breeder forums of
Overgrow, for instance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, Sam Skunkman's on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tom Hill's on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chimera is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like guys that are like real good at
what they're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And know a lot and are opinionated and,
you know, are fighting amongst each other
[SPEAKER_00]: over who's what now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Battling over this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in those battles, you get to see like,
well, here's why I believe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you could read that stuff
and you could get a lot more educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, yeah, you learn from you
learn from observation, you learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone teaching you, you learn from
reading and various sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, someone asked me earlier today,
like, you know, what's the what's the go
[SPEAKER_00]: to how if I wanted to start breeding,
where would I want to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you to go to marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's what I always tell you when
it comes in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana botany, first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a primer, Rob Clark did a real
good job of laying out all the basics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think anything's come close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even remote, like there's Greg Green's
Breeders Bible, all that and respect to
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think anything's come close to
Robert Clark's marijuana botany,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it's outdated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It still has so much info that is never
going to be outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it really is a true Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the basics and you want the
terminology and you want how the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, yeah, obviously it was
written a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things have advanced in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it's still a really good core,
core thing to learn there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's and that's, you know,
that, you know, so the other part of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: like people should probably realize that
when people bred, which did you call it
[SPEAKER_00]: with with red and camera, the shotgunning
method, Matt?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shotgun scatter method, the mail
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take some males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, these males look good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw them on these plants
and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you use one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you use five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd have to grow up a bunch of
seed and be like, which ones have the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits in them that I want to do for the
next round?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so it was kind of more,
I think, 20 years ago, it was a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were forced.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take multi-stage breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and so, you know,
you know, someone mentioned sub cool or
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsy nirvana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, the general point is that
more and more people started being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer seeds to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they were making their own seeds,
whether they were middlemanning seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: other people, you know, there started to
be a wider variety of places where you
[SPEAKER_00]: could actually get them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it started off with two,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brin's doing a dance for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went from, you used to have to go to
Amsterdam and, and that's part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why like SSSC and Neville met all
those important people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they were the only people doing what
they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these interested parties,
whether it's Seattle Greg or Sam Skunkman
[SPEAKER_00]: or Rob Clark or Jim Ortega, they all met
the same dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's two of them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was 10 and then there was
20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sub cool was a lot of people's
first breeder disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a, there's a phrase
that's used a lot, not, not in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just in general, which is don't get to
know your heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it applies to music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It applies to art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It applies to a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your heroes, the more you get to
know them, the more you're impressed by
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's, you're like, Oh my God,
how did, why do people think this way
[SPEAKER_00]: about this person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, and, and,
and so, you know, cause seed seeds have
[SPEAKER_00]: always been shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look like some, you know,
I mean, they don't have that much
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are tire strikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are pale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are small, but it's like,
you know, you buy these things and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what you get for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was all prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you going to, like,
there's no, like, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave a bad Yelp review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jumping online on Amazon and being like
this shit bag fucking, I suppose,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you didn't, you were just
like, you told your friends and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: bunk, but like there wasn't, you know,
like the forums, where the first place
[SPEAKER_00]: that people started to talk back and forth
amongst, like, what'd you find?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you find?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's always been, it's always been
a little bit rough because, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I, I talked about it on a show
earlier too, where people like Shanti and
[SPEAKER_00]: others, all those people in the second
generation, they decided to start hiding
[SPEAKER_00]: the lineage of what they used because they
didn't want all their competitors to just
[SPEAKER_00]: copy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been trying to figure out what the
exact parents are of AK 47 since AK 47
[SPEAKER_00]: popped up in the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I did invite, uh,
Simon on to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and Luke from paradise,
Simon said he would, but Luke from
[SPEAKER_03]: paradise is another one where you just
don't know what the genetics are in any of
[SPEAKER_03]: his lines, but he's made some really
awesome lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensei star.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows who fucking knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's theories about it being a
big star, holy weed cross, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of theories and they,
they, you know, because Neville and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Corel from SSSC didn't have any
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just like, this is this and
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I did with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from a guy in New York in a bad
seat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought these two cuts in Oregon and
that's how I got the G 13 and this hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the second wave, they all
obscured most of what they were using and
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they did it for competitive
reasons, but for like historians or people
[SPEAKER_00]: really wanting to know the lineage,
uh, I don't know how many hours Matt and
[SPEAKER_00]: I, and a group of our friends have spent
trying to figure out what's we've scoured
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere looking for lineage on some of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get hints here and there,
but it's never anything you can go off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you can track down the original,
quote unquote breeder or person who
[SPEAKER_03]: relates release the seeds nine times out
of 10, you're still not going to know at
[SPEAKER_03]: the very end, just because of the nature
of how people say cherry AK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, AK was a very, it had a
great name for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon only sold six things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, probably four of them
were pretty fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, you know, and it's,
um, you know, there was a sandalwood AK
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, in Colorado, uh, Matt's done a
bunch of work with the cherry AK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I had a lemon AK for quite a while
too, that we did work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an RC Cola AK back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, I mean, even like,
uh, who doesn't like Nebu or someone like
[SPEAKER_00]: that get all upset and say, no one else
could have a cherry AK, but him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is preposterous because if he found
it in seeds of AK 47, it obviously can
[SPEAKER_00]: pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, he says technically,
he says he owns, he owns cherry liqueur AK
[SPEAKER_03]: 47, but he owns also all of cherry AK 47
that no one else has right to use the name
[SPEAKER_03]: is what he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's just the flavor profile
that pops up in that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like pretty hard to like,
be like, I'm, I'm trademarking this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this turk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even his strain, but yeah,
like I'm the first one that came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, and so,
you know, he had, but what's in Kali
[SPEAKER_00]: missed what's in the only one I think he
actually said that you knew something was
[SPEAKER_00]: he had white Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you knew half of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was white widow by AK 47.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, but AK and Kali and some,
a lot of these different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: like people started obscuring what's
actually in stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or they started taking famous
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember when who was, who was the,
who was the group, uh, um, that claimed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have NL nine in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember NL six from Kenny from trichome
technologies that wasn't related to NL
[SPEAKER_03]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so, and you know, that's the
thing now is that, you know, we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about Todd a little bit or whatever,
but there's people that are popping up
[SPEAKER_00]: with these eighties and nineties seed
lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the names are so famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville did say, uh, Kali missed his NL
five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but then Neville was bitter and very,
I liked Neville or I liked Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's a Neville Stan is what we
call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Neville was famous for being bitter
and saying, everybody in Holland,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all ripped me off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that happened when he came back about
nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody had anything original.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to his credit, I will say,
um, you know, Adam and Simon and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and Tony left his company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started their own seed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden had a bunch of lines
really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little sus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's probably right that his stuff is
in a lot of what's around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean, it doesn't mean that it
doesn't mean that like all the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: they used was from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they probably took some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably even some breed, probably even
some breeding males.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what was always interesting to
me about the whole, um, hidden lineage
[SPEAKER_03]: type thing was that if these guys were
super, super well schooled breeders,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would have known that even if the
people had, had the recipe, let's say they
[SPEAKER_03]: just had the generic recipe of white widow
across the blueberry for blue widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, ha, we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could never remake it the same unless
they had the exact same clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just didn't make any sense to me that
they would ever hide the lineage,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that yet it did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pot of gold is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the comments, um, pot of gold
and, uh, and the real McCoy were my two
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite lines from the flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was Hawaiian by skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one was a Hindu Kush by
skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of the real McCoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the Hawaiian one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Hawaiian one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and so, yeah, they,
uh, um, they were like the reason why,
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason people, someone just asked how
come a bunch of the other NL numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's because after three or four years
of breeding with them, Neville decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: use the one, the two, and the female cut
he found to the five basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three, four, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10, 11, um, they just weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they weren't sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and Greg only Seattle, Greg,
he really, he only sent them to what he
[SPEAKER_00]: told.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did he tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, he sent them to Neville and the
drunkers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was basically only Neville and
then Sensi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sensi just ran with what Neville had
already discovered at the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, um, you know, and so that's
kind of where they went is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes sense because if you think
about it from Neville's perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he always used to joke that he
could be like, I'm going to release the
[SPEAKER_00]: most fire line ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone's like, oh, I found two
bananas and it didn't yield as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucks ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even back then the people felt
pressure from consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, people like to breed
with stuff that makes happy customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, NL's six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, 11 or whatever that were all
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like messes of Afghan and Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably were a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that he was using a lot of
Indians, Mexicans, Colombians mixed up in
[SPEAKER_03]: that, in that bid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's going to be some wild shit that
just wasn't good that they crossed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even today, most people don't want
to grow something that's longer than nine
[SPEAKER_00]: or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some NL 10 or whatever and you
grow it and it takes 13 weeks and you shit
[SPEAKER_00]: can it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most people would still do that
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's like it, it,
you know, and so that, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then maybe we should, we should
talk about something for a minute where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like the real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for, let's say from like 85 to 2005,
it was, it was all traditional breeding as
[SPEAKER_00]: the Lord intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just, you let a few males go
in a room full of ladies and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional types of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding were applied for the most part,
cause that's all anybody knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then around, you know, I don't know,
Matt knows better than me, but probably
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere around say 06 to 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A revolution happened in that,
and I'll shut up here in a minute and let
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt talk, but certain people started on
the forums and doing research and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figuring out that you could, you could
induce a female plant to produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could make feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that information was rare and tightly
held and how to do it was basically
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first, Matt knows better than I do,
but it was kind of like, who was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was you and.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, if you, if you start back
with the feminine stuff, you had Dutch
[SPEAKER_03]: passion, really starting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing some work on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, the skunk man had covered a little
bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fet from Spice Brothers had talked about
it a bit and he was over in, I think New
[SPEAKER_03]: Zealand, but as far as the American stuff,
it really didn't kick on into the American
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff till like OG Rascal, I, me,
CSI, and there were a few others,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, um, Soma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mentioned Soma.
[SPEAKER_03]: His, his rhodolization method was
notorious, which was basically the torture
[SPEAKER_03]: method, the herm torture method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small pop, the extreme drought,
the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get it to think it's dying multiple
times to the point where it freaks out and
[SPEAKER_00]: panics and throws some nanners that you
can use.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and during, during that period,
probably, I mean, I want to say all the
[SPEAKER_03]: way up to like 2013, 2014, fem seeds were
just looked down upon, or at least the
[SPEAKER_03]: general consensus was all fems herm,
all fem seeds herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all produce poor fucking progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all, it's all riddled with shit and
mutants and, you know, and, and it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and even though that wasn't the case and
people weren't finding that, it didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a common, a common theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you were cheating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a huge, there was a huge issue
with, with feminized seed where most
[SPEAKER_00]: customers felt like you were cheating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were cheating and destroying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Destroying the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were fucking up lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were selling out for profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were getting rid of males and getting
rid of traditional breeding so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could, you could skip steps and profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were looked down on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should make the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I said, you know,
that era was because all the first people
[SPEAKER_00]: that Matt mentioned, they were not sharing
how they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you couldn't find out from Dutch
passion, how they were making feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you couldn't find out from FET.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't find out from any of these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did it exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it hidden knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first people I did actually see
say how to do it was FET.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he released someone else's info that
was around, but FET put it out there
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the first recipe on how to make
STS mixture that I saw.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Caleb remembers better than me on who
was the original person that wrote it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my first introduction to it was when
FET published it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, yeah, that stuff was,
someone said collodial silver was hidden
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people want to say that like all
the knowledge that people have right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: even with breeders like Matt or like CSI
or people that have been doing feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for the last 10 to 12, 14 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still an art form with a lot of
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of failure in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just like, oh, I'm going to
spray collodial silver or I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray some STS and now I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I was doing a bunch of
breeding, you don't really fail with
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had a male failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never like was like, oh, I failed that
whole seed run and now I'm growing like 18
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains, one or two of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have one or two or three males and
they would produce an enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen for your whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people first started experimenting,
and let's be clear, we're not done
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and CSI and I and Matt and CSI and
other various friends, we talk all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time about improving methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limiting failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone fails.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to trying to find the consist.
[SPEAKER_03]: What what brings consistency in reversals
is it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, me, I talk about this with CSI
three or four times a week, just our
[SPEAKER_03]: different findings and and comparing our
notes and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just we no one's found a
consistent way to guarantee that every
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, every expression of every plant,
meaning not just you know, but it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: expressions of the same clone two feet
apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why one reverses and drops pollen and the
other reverses and doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no answers to this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's always experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done, you know, they've done
things where it's like Matt or him have
[SPEAKER_00]: have reversed something and it's worked
like a charm and they've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable results and it's dumped
pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go back and they use those
same plants to reverse them again and they
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same thing to the plant and it
fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or or drops 10 percent of the amount of
pollen it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I see I see our buddy
PIPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and failure is really frustrating
for a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you might only get if you're
nonstop breeding, you might only get three
[SPEAKER_00]: or four cracks at breeding a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to buy the SDS spray,
it's on right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seatco.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got our reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone asked about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm saying reversal spray up at right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seatco.com where you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just just read the read the directions
because I'm very, very transparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you're going to have to try
three or four times not to get it to
[SPEAKER_03]: reverse, but to drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reversing doesn't mean success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showing balls doesn't mean success.
[SPEAKER_03]: You only have success when it drops pollen
and makes seeds and makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, even just on the forums
and all the learning of like how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: what of each to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I use colloidal silver?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I use STS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I use this other thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I tried this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need less concentration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need more concentration?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I combine them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I apply it once strong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I apply it 15 times week?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do all that and get success and
try to repeat it the next time,
[SPEAKER_03]: the exact same way with all the same
inputs, it may not perform in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's so it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forums slowly, slowly pushing
feminized seed was like a sea change in
[SPEAKER_00]: how people bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because before everyone had to have
males and everyone had to keep those males
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody traded seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then people were like,
oh, I can take this elite and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse it and cross it to these other
elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now most readers honestly don't
even have males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lot don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most most it's it's completely
shifted in the last 10 to 14 years from
[SPEAKER_00]: like a few people getting shit on for
daring to reverse plants and cheating to
[SPEAKER_00]: being the way everyone does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made I made a backwards switch where
I did almost all exclusively feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding for a long time and went back to
doing mostly male breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite selling the spray just because it
is costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is super costly to make them seeds
because of the failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like our buddy Pip commented,
but we've had a bunch of really good
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that have tried to reverse sour
and and failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or, you know, I remember you
know, you know, Pip reversed it once and
[SPEAKER_00]: got like 30 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you're like,
oh, I have a little handful for myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't actually sell them to the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have enough to give to my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think CSI the first two or three times
he tried to reverse TK failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was real bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept trying different methods to
even get the thing to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he finally got it to reverse and it
gave him about 10 or 15 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds he would normally get from something
that reversed well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it it's completely shifted
how people breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely shifted what they're
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely shifted like what,
you know, what what customers expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I was talking about in the
beginning, a lot of these seed lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would be available for like five or
10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seed products today are one offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that same breeder will go back and
redo the line again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most seeds exist from however many
seeds that dude got or that lady got until
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone's asking me about red pollen
on Fem plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of a lot of today's cloning the
lines that are being hit are Fem's.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just made with bag seed herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's it's so common that it's
in moot point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you could have things that you
don't realize are a Fem plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do have some thoughts on why
things don't reverse well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a show in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people people should think about,
you know, because one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders get hated on the most,
which I'm actually supportive of,
[SPEAKER_00]: is herms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got to think about for.
[SPEAKER_00]: For forever of cannabis history,
herms were a survival tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allowed female plants to pollinate
themselves and continue the species if for
[SPEAKER_00]: some reason the males got killed or the
pollen failed or they weren't around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lots of strains hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the beginning, all the weed
was seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you care if it hurt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're selling seeded weed, all the tie,
all the Colombian, all the Mexican,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it was all it was all seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only really herms started only
really becoming an issue for people in
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the 90s, late 80s, early 90s when
people were growing indoor and they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: very small amount of weed they were trying
to grow for them and their friends or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't want to get a seeded room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those herms had been bred in as a
survival mechanism for cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: millennia, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've and there's only been about 30
years of pressure to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now the cookies is the abundance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's back in full form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happens to is somebody
mentioned S1s, you know, and stuff and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, S1s I'll be the maybe I'm not
the first to tell you, but S1s kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: suck.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, obviously I have friends
that sell S1s so I'm not dissing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even they will tell you that like the
primary goal of an S1 is to find the look
[SPEAKER_00]: in that exact strain without an outcross
and see what's in its genetics or for
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for preservation, you know,
and you're more likely to try to find an
[SPEAKER_00]: elite or two or something you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are to get any kind of
consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want consistency and you
want phenols to pop at some rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: an outcross is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or S2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a lot of cases, there might only be
one cutting left of an entire line for you
[SPEAKER_00]: to work through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might not be a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people don't keep males either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you get a male of Trinity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you how do you get a male of dog
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get a male of corn?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get a male of of, you know,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in a lot of cases, you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You used to be able to get males by you'd
buy the seed line and it was a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that it's almost all femme,
you can't even get a male if you wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take some a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, why are some S1s uniform and
some aren't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have a bunch of uniform
S1s, it means that there's not very much
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic variation in that cut whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a bunch of crazy stuff all over
the place, it means that you have a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: wide genetic lineage in there that it's
going to express in all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to dumb it down, it just means if you
have a bunch of variation, you have a line
[SPEAKER_03]: that would probably wasn't worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a uniform line, it was
probably whatever that clone was came from
[SPEAKER_03]: a line that was either worked or already
uniform to begin with by nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, and so males have
become super rare, you know, and and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that and everyone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so breeding has gone from almost a
guaranteed success.
[SPEAKER_00]: To very dicey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, yeah, and in natural
agriculture or like agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: normal agriculture, most most breeding
work is done with selfing and feminizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's not a lot of male work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Candidates is just catching up to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just catching up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it and that's the other
part of it is like real, real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say real breeding because
I don't want to insult anyone,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural breeding, they are breeding
with very specific goals in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, mostly reading is goals most.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, in cannabis breeding,
I don't know if it's goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: No seed making seed making in cannabis is
not goals, but actual breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, for instance, if you're breeding
something like I'll just throw it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there like corn, you might be going for
ear size and disease resistance and pest
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it finishes and you have certain
traits you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to sell for you're
going to like breed on that level,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're finding plants that match all those
characteristics and you're trying to lock
[SPEAKER_00]: them in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way we breed now,
most people are just most people aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: growing rooms of seed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just feno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's not a lot of breeders
that are like, I need to be able to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: this super consistent oracle by snow
because people are going to plant acres of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the qualities they're
looking for when they plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like crossing things and then
hoping, you know, hoping something pops
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, our buddy bitter just
said breeding should be goal oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, be goal oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more goals you add to what you
want, the harder you made your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you start adding to it,
finding what you want in one plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more things you put on that plant that
you have to have is tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so a lot of times now,
maybe we should talk about this for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second, because this is totally your era
where it's like when breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding became, I'm going to reverse this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an elite that most people can't
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to cross it to these 10 or
15 things that you also probably can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to sell seeds and you
probably can't get either parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've already gotten excited about
both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe there's something cool in the
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tested it, but there's a lot of
breeders out there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That don't test their own work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be like, you know,
and I'm, I'm not calling anybody out
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, but it's like, I'm going to
take gelato this and I'm going to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: it onto the 12 most popular cuts I know of
that are getting decent, decent ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to add packaging and
I'm going to make a special name for each
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to hope somebody finds
something bomb and it helps my sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do, you don't, yeah, you do lose,
you do lose hybrid vigor with S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're breathing with your, you can lose
vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: With S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, depending on it, it's,
it's, it depends on how you compare it
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's lines that are old clones
that are slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you, if you make S1s of it,
it'll make it look like you've given the
[SPEAKER_03]: line new vigor, but it's just because you
were growing an old, slow clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it depends on how people look at it,
but hybrid vigor it like, like not so
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, it implies hybrid hybridizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's an S1, it's selfing,
not hybridizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I look at maybe this is a bad
definition too, because we could talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about how misused names are in,
in, you know, people get breeding terms
[SPEAKER_00]: from other areas and try to apply them to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't, it's not exactly a
straight, because we don't have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, hybrid vigor is
when you take two P1 parents and cross
[SPEAKER_00]: them and in the hybrid, all of the
dominant genes pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just two P1 parents though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two specifically different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has, it's not, they can't be similar in
order to get, it has to be two totally
[SPEAKER_03]: different to get the hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a famous one would be,
you know, I don't know, an L5 haze or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would be one, a very, a very indica with a
very sativa, very different lineages pops,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and that's another thing too,
is people don't like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, this is what's like,
if you look on some of the lineage stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, I'm going to cross kushments by
apples and banana by this and that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's so much incestuous stuff
that's gone on because people have
[SPEAKER_00]: overused the same clones over and over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the most successful crosses are by
crossing vastly different things from one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading today is a lot more, of I wonder
if I can find my own slight variation on
[SPEAKER_00]: this already popular theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't you agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the majority is looking for,
this is already popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can get, maybe the name and maybe
the look and maybe the pictures will catch
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get one famous thing,
you know, I'm not going to call them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, um, look at what finding Mac one
did for, for cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, somebody finds a, uh,
what they consider to be a killer Fino in
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden the next power,
however many seed drops you have sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's hype around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people don't find their own stuff
because they're not, um, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: growing their own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, like, uh, our buddy Caleb is one
of the few people where you can just see
[SPEAKER_00]: years and years and years of him popping
his own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to answer this question real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because it's one I see a lot and,
and it's, there's no steadfast answer to
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was from Nigel, no friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much phenotypic genotypic variation do
you experience from S ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read a lot of contradicting
information and the answer is it really
[SPEAKER_03]: depends on how worked one parent was.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's, if it's a self, how, how worked
that clone was and how not worked the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the pollen donor is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if, if it's a worked line,
let's say it's a, a, a deep chunk,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's go deep jump.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a deep chunk and you S one deep
chunk, you're not going to have very much
[SPEAKER_03]: variation at all because it's a worked
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's already very few phenotypes in the
line that you selected the clone from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you choose like Cushman's you S
one, a phenotype of Cushman's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's all kinds of bullshit in
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's going to be variant to
any degree, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's why there's no specific
answer to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To how much variation is in an S one,
it just really depends on the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another way to put it and,
uh, uh, Caleb talked about this before
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like, let's say you were to S
one deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were to give out a bunch of those
seeds and let people make their own
[SPEAKER_00]: selections because there's not much
variation in that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people's own selections, they're
probably going to look a lot like deep
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's, he's talked about like how the
Mendo P that I, that I found has very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very wide variation in, in the S ones,
which leads us to believe that it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: an actual land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you could, he's like, you know,
you could give 50 or a hundred seeds to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: people and tell them, pick what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you had them two years later,
I'll gather and bring the weed that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had created, it would look vastly
different because people would be making
[SPEAKER_00]: their own choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually some of the stuff even
early on, like people like Mel Frank that
[SPEAKER_00]: sent Durbin to Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders will tell you, well, it was this
way when I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I gave it to these guys and they
made different choices than I would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's not even remotely like what I
preferred.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they made different choices than I
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it anise and they made it all red
hair and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or bite or this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, it, uh, so as one S S
one is just a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these are all just, these are all
just tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's no like better way
than another necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're all just like based on what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, are you looking for,
you know, it's never really happened
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but like, are you looking for
like, I want to plant 10 acres and I want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to be uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like as uniform as deep chunk
would be very valuable for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something like, you know,
but there's other, there's other lines
[SPEAKER_00]: that are all over the place that wouldn't
be very good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that line that's all over the place,
it might be amazing to find a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: expression that you can then clone and
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden it becomes an elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and to add to that, a lot of people
don't understand that when you select a
[SPEAKER_03]: clone, uh, from a, from a wide varied
line, let's say it's you pop a thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and it's the only clone like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you select that clone to breed,
it may not, it may not be breeding true to
[SPEAKER_03]: the type that it is because it was an
outlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may only show up one in 500 times in
the F2 round.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't necessarily mean because you
pick that clone, it's always going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: like that clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that clone is an outlier, you are not
going to run into that clone very often.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be more often than you did in the
F1.
[SPEAKER_03]: But however, it'll still not be very
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be an odd combination of
recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because it popped in that
particular theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male doesn't mean it'll pop and it's
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, people, there was a guy up
there saying, get rid of all the anus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, you know, everybody has
strong opinions about various flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we should get rid of any
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because everyone has different
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, there was, yeah,
don't say that here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause then Gene's going to think that I'm
fucking shit talking him and fucking all
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, there was a time, there was a
time when, uh, when, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Terpeneleon in, uh, in, uh,
watching my fuck, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Jack or train wreck was loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was certainly loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it bred so true for itself that
people got burnt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Terpeneleon.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People fucking a man, people like Cali O
and all this citrus stuff came out and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was hella popular for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like moderate potency and
kind of one note.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sort of faded from, it sort of
faded from the world a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the dab revolution
happened, you know, with, and nails
[SPEAKER_00]: started coming out and all these
accoutrements to be able to like smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: hash in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fucking DNA comes out with tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most blown out Terp that nobody
wanted was new again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were like, Oh, this citrus is
just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stoked on this citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where 10 years before people would be
like, Ooh, citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want no fucking citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call that shit headache weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always, I was not a fan of, uh,
Cali O or, uh, any kind of tangy or any of
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting about that kind of
stuff is when tangy came out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, because it came out in the first few
years of sort of like the modern,
[SPEAKER_00]: like hash dab revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it didn't matter as flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get bored of it pretty quickly,
but you turn it into BHO or you turn it
[SPEAKER_00]: like there wasn't rosin really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you turn it into some kind of extract
and now it goes from like 13% THC to 80.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets you hot at that point,
you know, and there was an, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: another aspect too, where it's like a lot
of times with extractions, not all those
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps come through strong, but those
citrus Terps popped strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden they had, it's like
bell bottoms coming back or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, you, you couldn't give
them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden the next
generation is like, this citrus is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get more lemon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get more orange?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get more tangerine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of fatal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had a, our, our buddy,
uh, our buddy Pip rocked that lemon G cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, you know, and so things go in and
out of things go in and out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: in and out of flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was talking about that with
Panda the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was smoking some Georgia pie and I had
no, no fucking clue what it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what was in it, but lemon G has this
certain specific fucking flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That runs through all of its progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's this thing, like for me,
I could not scrape that flavor off my
[SPEAKER_03]: tongue hard or fast enough, but I smoked
that Georgia pie and you can immediately
[SPEAKER_03]: sense it in there, but it's not listed in
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope those people who have it out
there, give it, give it a, give it a
[SPEAKER_03]: little flavor puff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have some lemon G to compare it
to, uh, uh, tell me if I'm right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and someone, someone was
talking about just, just now, like they
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about how, uh, um,
you know, uh, train wreck train wreck was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of unique because it was like,
it was one of the first named clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt yielded really big people were
all of a sudden going indoors and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting big yields out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, Jack Herrera becoming so
popular, burned people out on the turp for
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And train wreck being just fucking
everywhere for awhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train wrecking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, it just gets burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so, you know, flavors and
turf profiles come and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, I don't really like,
like for me, like, like that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus, isn't that popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think it's too one dimensional for
me, but I do like the sweet citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some of it where it's,
it, it, it tastes like I opened my mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: and sprayed orange cleaner on directly on
my tongue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a stringent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I feel about lemon G is it's
just like having a lemon grow a Dick and
[SPEAKER_03]: piss in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so like, if you like sushi
or whatever, like a citrus could be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good, like, like pickled ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be like a really good palate
cleanser before you smoke something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people can't rock citrus all day
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they get burned out on it,
but some people love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tends to like, you know,
I mean, that's, that's kind of the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: where, um, I can't remember who commented
on it, but we were talking a bunch about
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one in a previous episode and there
was an era where like they gypsy Nirvana
[SPEAKER_00]: and those different guys, they all gave
away skunk one as freebies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they had, because they had a shit
ton of it and nobody wanted to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wanted skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody, nobody, you couldn't sell it for
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, God, I got thousands of
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll at least just give them out as
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or remember when they were, everyone was
giving out skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or high skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, now all of a sudden
people are like, Oh, what old,
[SPEAKER_00]: rare skunk one can you find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some of that old, rare skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people from 15 years ago,
they're giving, you mean the shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were giving out for free and nobody
wanted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even dissing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just what, how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just people, things go in
and out of fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, I mean,
uh, the blue flavor, does it taste like
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smoked weed that tasted like
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good blueberry should taste like
blueberries.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, you know, um, super skunk is
not still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Oh, you mean from sensei?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean like, like there aren't what
we know of for sure as pure super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe diesel is a, is, is there's a
lot of stuff that's derived from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think diesel is probably one of the
closest, but yeah, we don't know if it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid of super skunk technically,
like we can't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at it and be like,
man, it really has a lot of super skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely skunkoid in the way that it
grows and the way that it this and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that that, but maybe that's, maybe that's
something that we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Matt and I talked about it when we
were kind of like mapping out what we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to chat is that every five or 10
years, uh, what you can get from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: reinvents itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all these distinct errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned it before on, on,
on another thing, but we were,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt and I were looking through a
friend's, um, freezer that he was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had an enormous amount of seeds
from like, oh, wait to, to 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say 99% of them, if you wanted
to buy a pack of it today, you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, there was stuff from Mr.
Knight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a, there was a few things here
and there that you could get from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: company, but for the most part,
it was all like, but that stuff at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time was hella popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was everywhere back then, but now it
was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hella popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, he talked about OG
rascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG rascal for three or four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he had a bunch of good cuts and
he was one of the first guys doing
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed and he made a bunch of
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He even had a super scunk cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a 56 day super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say something like that,
but you, you, you couldn't, you can't find
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so what happens is seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk since he's since he still
exists, but you, you can't get anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like you would get from 90 centsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get, you can't get 90s serious
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of these people might get mad
at me for saying it, but it's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not the way shit works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they had to reconstitute the line
from seeds, you know, maybe they outsource
[SPEAKER_00]: it to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most, most seeding, most seeds are,
they're there until they're not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you know, 10 years or
something like that, the only thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: exists might be a cut or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're about almost at a hundred
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll start turning this down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going in far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, anything else you wanted to get
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, this is a big topic,
you know, I just thought that it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: good for people to chat about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of misconceptions about what
breeders are up to and what they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and what their methods are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and, you know, all that and
like breeding has evolved a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding also evolves based on competition
and based on what the customers want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The customers drive it fully now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because, because the prices are so
low on wheat currently, I don't think that
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a, a, an option for breeders to
try to drive a market as much based on
[SPEAKER_03]: their own height, their own, you know,
like building a brand, building the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there was a, when I was doing
most of my breeding, there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: there wasn't really American breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really an outlet for those
kinds of seeds that I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were, we, we wanted to be, but this
was, it was too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was kind of, I would say there's
probably like 10 year explosion of
[SPEAKER_00]: American breeders and all kinds of people
being able to jump in and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make crosses with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of, I think we're coming
to the tail end of that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we definitely are.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are having to figure out whole
different ways of reinventing their
[SPEAKER_03]: companies themselves, how seeds are sold,
how they're marketed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and just, you know, and on top
of that, it's like, it was profitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the profit is, is, you know,
profit is defined, you know, most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: seed companies were all supported by a
bunch of small and medium sized growers
[SPEAKER_00]: with extra money in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it becomes more centralized and it
becomes more legalized, then there's less
[SPEAKER_00]: money going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less desire to hunt through
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even, and even then too, it's like
people today, if you want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding today, you're going to get a
hodgepodge of plants that are a mix of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's been popular in the last
15 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big worm was the high watermark was we're
holding his dick picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, that was the highest, that was the
highest point we ever got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, a lot of these,
a lot of these people got famous for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certain circles, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lucky dog, lucky dog is our,
is our buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he, he uses a lot of real cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the best ways to be a good
breeder as Neville would say is to have
[SPEAKER_00]: good, good plants to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be, he knows good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been around good weed forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a major advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing good weed, knowing good weed and,
and honestly, um, maybe, uh, I always,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get weirded out when I talk about
this, but maybe we could finish a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on this is that what's happened a lot
with IG as we're on IG is, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's, it's become very visualized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, breeding and people's desire for stuff
has become extremely visual and extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: testing based and extremely named based
where 20 years ago, 15 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was mostly effect based.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things became popular because they had a
great flavor, a great effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because most people couldn't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people bred for effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a, there's a corollary here
where in, uh, I don't know, most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if people know this or not,
but pit bulls and like Staffordshire
[SPEAKER_00]: terriers are basically the same breed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Staffordshire terriers are bred for looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, when, when actual dog
fighting was still allowed, pit bulls were
[SPEAKER_00]: bred for what was called game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And game was basically a, uh, I don't
approve dog breeding by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Game was basically, um, uh, a complete
disregard for its own health and a
[SPEAKER_00]: willingness to just get crazy and fight to
the death.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you couldn't like, but much like with
cannabis and smoking it, you can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Game isn't shoulder structure and chin and
jaw and color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't tell if weed's going to knock
your head off by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you sure can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of ugly weed that
hits me way, way harder than some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: prettiest weed I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tests it like 8% and it will knock
your head off harder than pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like a lot of good sours or whatever
they test in the low twenties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get some purple punch that
tested 30% and I can't even tell I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of, uh, as people
have bred for looks and bed for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've lost that invisible effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People call it the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think, Oh, it's some combination of
THC and terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this and that and the alls or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know what it's all there
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, but we know that,
but people used to breed for effect and
[SPEAKER_00]: people used to hold onto things that had
unique effects and cookies and these,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these types of things started ushering
in a wave and IG is super to blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for, you know, for looks, it looks
gorgeous, you know, Oh, this amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it doesn't get me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like fucking tangy mother fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, you know, who wants a
girlfriend that's like a true 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she's mean to you, you know,
I mean, like, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's no fun either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, Oh yeah, she looks
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Oh no, not when the door
closes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's totally rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's every dude's dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She cheats on me and she treats,
and she's hella mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of bland weed right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of very attractive,
very bland weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Blackberry Kush out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of bland weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, uh, you know,
smoking for effect effect is invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, you don't know it till you try
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing, there's no testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe we get Chimera on here and
he totally disagreed with me and make me
[SPEAKER_00]: look foolish, but I still think that the
best test is the smoke test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robots can't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go to, I'll go to bat for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end result, what matters is
how it affects me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of us, you know, yeah,
it's like, it's, it's whole, it's our
[SPEAKER_00]: whole desire for it is for it to,
I want it to work good and taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the top two things for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Affecting flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I can get great yield and I can get
great looks, I can get all this other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it's not, I'd rather have it
taste, taste and work phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause in a joint, you know, it looks like
a white piece, a white or a tan piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bong rip and a, you know,
I mean, what is, you know, you extract it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't even know what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's goo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All, all, all extractions look the same to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's different types or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in general, it's all a fucking
extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking at goo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all different types of goo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you know, at that,
at that point, uh, what did, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what did chimera call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're a resin farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're farming resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower content and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm big on effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but effect doesn't come through IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot harder to build rep off effect
because you actually have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not something test results can
tell you by looking at the test results,
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we can't, you know, but tomorrow
burner and, and Chris compound could come
[SPEAKER_00]: out with the new, new, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be all glistening and perfect
lighting and professional camera work and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone would ooh and ah,
and this and that nobody even knows if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's any good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's effect is boring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a specific example that I won't
say, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I just wanted to throw that
out there at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to talk about all that is
that, you know, breed for what's
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing is effect,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what you're, that's how it
affects you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't affect everyone the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, try to smoke it with a
decent variety of friends and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: they think too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you find winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you find real keepers in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, and that, and to be honest,
that's the reason why, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: stop some, like a lot of these things from
20 years ago are going to have their day
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sun again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, because we'll look at all the
people right now coming out with,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have real sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, look at how many people still
breed with Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at how many, you know, it's like,
look at how many people on these got like
[SPEAKER_00]: some friends, you know, are breeding with
NL five hazes and stuff like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: she has lasting power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where will purple punch be in 10
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we're, I, you know, you're going
to plug anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check out the website, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: See co.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got our breeders packs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the spray up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check out speakeasy.com speakeasy.com
and breeder syndicate has a bunch of new
[SPEAKER_03]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been dropping up some of its old
content, but newer episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them kind of fallen in the,
in the unhearable range, meaning like they
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go listen to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go support.

[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That outlet behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a, I don't know why there's
some interesting design choices in this
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an Alex gray canvas behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's an improvement from the,
from the wall that I had before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, we're going to throw these up on
podcasts too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to do them every Friday
and just talk about random stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can always hit up me or Matt with
subject matter or ideas that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get talked about at length.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and join the, join the, the Patreon
breeder syndicate, Patreon, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: you asking for not so to a preview is his
approval list is fucking miles long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best way to talk to not so is on
the breeder syndicate, Patreon,
[SPEAKER_03]: go join.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we're trying to do this
thing where we talk about stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly isn't about us and we're not trying
to like self promote or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to get a wide variety of
weed information out there and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: people like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people didn't use it, learn it,
learn for themselves how to be critical
[SPEAKER_00]: thinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a, we had a too long of a break,
but we're back at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to be pumping this
stuff out.
Absolutely.
Yep.
