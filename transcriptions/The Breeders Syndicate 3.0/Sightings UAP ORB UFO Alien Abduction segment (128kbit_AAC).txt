[SPEAKER_02]: Regression therapy is an extremely
controversial method in which abductees
[SPEAKER_02]: relive their UFO encounters under
hypnosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some scientists suggest that what they're
actually reliving might be repressed
[SPEAKER_02]: emotional trauma or subconscious fears
from childhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the abductee, the alien encounter
is very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: In abduction cases, many times the person
will remember consciously that something
[SPEAKER_00]: strange or bizarre happened to them,
something out of the ordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They desire to go into hypnosis to
retrieve the hidden memories.
[SPEAKER_03]: During some abductions, I'm aware of them,
of their taking sperm samples in many
[SPEAKER_03]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've done it many different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: With tubes, with light catheters.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one way I have not been able to
deal with emotionally or under regression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one where there's a being on

[SPEAKER_00]: As incredible as it sounds, these people
are actually reliving these terrifying
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.

scars but real physical scars as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even more disturbing are stories from
women who believe they were abducted for
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As incredible as this may sound,
we have come across in the research cases
[SPEAKER_00]: having to do with missing fetuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember they numbed me from the waist
down and they took something that looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like an umbilical cord attached to
placenta and they levitated it into some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later abduction scenarios, she's actually
shown a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this baby is not like a human baby
that, as we know it, it's a cross between
[SPEAKER_00]: an alien and a human.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the central question of UFO research
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are they manufacturing these
offspring, these babies?
[SPEAKER_04]: If we knew the answer to that,
I think we would have a large part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: UFO mystery finally in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every reported encounter with an alien
