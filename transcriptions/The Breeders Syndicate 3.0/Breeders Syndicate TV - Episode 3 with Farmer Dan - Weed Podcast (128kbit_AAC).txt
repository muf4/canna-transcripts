know, whatever we want to talk about but I
[SPEAKER_00]: try to streamline it to a certain degree
with you know Try to do do interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, but a lot of it is just simple
shit You know, like I said, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: chill podcast about whatever you want to
talk about this pertain the weed But I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to kind of start them off to kind of
getting to know stuff about the guest or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe if people haven't watched your
episodes on the main show before Maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they can kind of get you to know you Do
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't mind, I'd like to start
off at the beginning bro What when was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time you smoked or maybe it wasn't
the first time you heard about weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old were you were if you can share
where you were if not, that's fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: too But kind of give us something like the
intro to you to cannabis for you Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to school like right outside a
little town called Davis and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really know anyone that smoked weed it was
like one friend had an older sibling that
[SPEAKER_01]: like got us our first bag and Or like
maybe one dude bought a baggie off these
[SPEAKER_01]: other guys we knew something like that,
you know what I mean, but like We used to
[SPEAKER_01]: just like smoke pipes like we had metal
pipes and shitty little glass pipes and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit None of it had any names because
we're like 13 year old kids Just like
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking behind the trailer so these place,
you know But uh and then late a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: later probably on like 15 or 16 like my
buddy's dad was a deadhead dude and so he
[SPEAKER_01]: showed us just like tons of good music
showed us what like actual good weed was
[SPEAKER_01]: and He was the first dude that showed me
like growing plants like he was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: some white widow in his garage and Had a
few little outdoor plants of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was cool, man Got us our first bag
of mushrooms, you know all that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit So he was like the real like
introduction of just like oh you can like
[SPEAKER_01]: this is how it all works Because before it
was just buying bags and smoking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just like total cussing vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But um, yeah Maybe maybe you can talk
about the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean cuz like growing up where I'm from
in Kentucky It was like fucking Reggie
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie shit weed bro brick we for a long
time So did you I mean was your first
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with like was it brick weed or
was it actual?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said eventually you got into
like a white widow With that older you
[SPEAKER_00]: with your buddy's dad, but like was that
it was brickweed even a thing around where
[SPEAKER_00]: you were at in Cali?
[SPEAKER_01]: No in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen before Wow, the closest
thing I ever saw some Jamaican weed so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the famous skateboarder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep So I grew up right down the street
from his mom and his little brothers and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit His dad like came and went to Jamaica
I think like I don't know their whole
[SPEAKER_01]: story, but that was the closest thing I
ever saw Was I bought some Jamaican shit
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie I remember at one point like when I
first started buying Reggie at one point
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, it was a hundred dollars From this
Mexican dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fucking with I mean the price is
fluctuated but I was when I when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: buying my first zips You know there were
Reggie and they like a hundred bucks bro
[SPEAKER_00]: for a Zip of CDS what can Reggie that's
crazy that you didn't see any any brick
[SPEAKER_00]: weed at all, bro Cuz that was all we had
for fucking years Yeah, no, like I still
[SPEAKER_01]: to this day not never seen like proper
Mexican No, she never won.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you ain't missing missing much It's
like low grade outdoor from Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: because I later Met the dude and like we
had common friends and shit that was like
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in most of those for like people
my age in the in the area and Like it was
[SPEAKER_01]: all like, okay, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: None of it was like crap at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes It was more likely to get like ripped
off in some other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like someone gives you like a foil It was
a little nuggle weed in there still
[SPEAKER_01]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like Most of the time when you
got weed growing up, it was either pinch,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro Or you would find weird shit like
pebbles string hair a lot a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: in it a lot of like weave hair,
bro I find weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting hood packs, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finding weave hair in my in my packs,
but uh, yeah, they're just Terrible shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know There was something maybe it
was just cuz we were so isolated and we
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't get weed On a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I still remember droughts at times
even for like Reggie stuff, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall and later but but Yeah,
before I forget did you have was there
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in that shit you're getting from
Humboldt then or was it all pretty much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really the occasional one because I do
remember popping like one little seed Like
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 in my window still and I grew like this
big I was like My parents were not cool
[SPEAKER_00]: with that and so Yeah, no never really I'm
so jealous of Not really jealous,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just wish I could have taken apart
took him took him Part of like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like all culture but just like that
growing up in a place like Cali where you
[SPEAKER_00]: would find like your homie's dad that was
growing weed cuz like I mean In Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just so Looked down upon that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't really tell motherfuckers what
that shit if you were fucking with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro Cuz I swear to God everybody I knew
that did or every grow that I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually got Raided or most of the time
Rob, bro and Rob by like people they knew
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was like 99% of the time is by like
And speaking of speaking of which did you
[SPEAKER_00]: ever get into and maybe you don't want to
share them and that's fine last episode
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about getting held up but Is there
been any sketchy situations as you've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown up, you know in your younger days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting me, you know pinched or or robbed
or or or ripped off or maybe just sketchy
[SPEAKER_00]: situations I mean I I hung out in a lot of
fucking parking lots for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting hours to get like a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just wondering like did you ever
have any any sketchy shit going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we were My buddy's dad gave us
some money to go buy him an ounce and we
[SPEAKER_01]: hit up the dude Which is the dude like
that kind of supplied the whole area and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit I actually later worked with this to
my like corporate job He was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other growers of a facility And so yes,
I have not forgotten We gave him the money
[SPEAKER_01]: he was supposed to go to his older
brother's place grab the bag and come back
[SPEAKER_01]: like to fucking out Hours goes by and it's
starting to get dark and shit and like
[SPEAKER_01]: this one dude that is friends with them
kind of like did a pass around us on his
[SPEAKER_01]: DMX and that dips he's like, oh it's
coming, you know, like it comes and we get
[SPEAKER_01]: like halfway home and uh that one dude
like tackled me off my fucking bike and
[SPEAKER_01]: then like the other dude like tries to
grab my buddy who has the bag and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm like on the ground like face down
with a dude's like fucking elbow in my
[SPEAKER_01]: neck and Like he's like trying to fight my
buddy for the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know someone came outside
It's like right in front of a junior high
[SPEAKER_01]: and like people I'll do the right across
the road and so like people started coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out and ended up dipping Did you get your
weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got our weed for sure Just like
the dude that we bought the weed from it
[SPEAKER_01]: was him that fucking jumped us And so it's
just like Dude that that reminds me of we
[SPEAKER_00]: did the episode on the main show with Matt
With Madjag and was talking about I asked
[SPEAKER_00]: him the same question basically sketchy
like if he ever been sketchy situations
[SPEAKER_00]: shit He talked about a little bit,
but he was talking about how he carried a
[SPEAKER_00]: like a big fucking hunting knife with him
And I laughed I didn't bring it up to him
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day that I don't know if
you watched the last episode But I did get
[SPEAKER_00]: robbed one time in my life when I was
really young over like an ounce of Reggie
[SPEAKER_00]: and At the time I did carry a big-ass
fucking my dad had this okay bar that he
[SPEAKER_00]: had in the service and I carried that with
me bro, and when I got robbed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah, I always I always thought
it was a possibility I'd have that knife
[SPEAKER_00]: on me and you always have these ideas of
the way the shit's coming down going down
[SPEAKER_00]: like a movie But it was it's never like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean my situation in particular I was
surrounded by like four dudes that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: see at night in the middle of a parking
lot by myself And they had a 45 on me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't like everybody I talked to
you was like I would have grabbed the gun
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like dude the dude didn't even
get in the way The dude didn't even get in
[SPEAKER_00]: the whip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in an old Monte Carlo, you know big
This dude he's clear across on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no power steering, bro It's snowing
outside parking lot full they robbed me
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily thank God there was snow in
that parking lot, dude Cuz I did my best
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to run these fuckers over,
bro and Luckily for them there it was
[SPEAKER_00]: snowy and they just jumped over the curb
and the park line jumped a fence dude but
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove up over that fucking curb trying
to get these guys bro and Our town is so
[SPEAKER_00]: small bro that by the next day I knew who
it was because they were bragging about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh ounce of Reggie, bro You know I'm
saying this is the shit back then I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's like, you know 70 bucks 100
bucks for Ford or whatever But it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: silly bro looking back but that Changed
the way I did shit, you know dealing and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff or sure moving on from from them
Anyways, not to get the focus on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But uh, so so you're you're you're growing
up from Cali, bro You're you're you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbling in weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your homie's dad teaching you how
to grow and stuff like that or the basics
[SPEAKER_00]: at what point do you Decide I know you
said you popped a few little seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff But at what point do you attempt to
like, you know, do your first growing was
[SPEAKER_00]: it an outdoor grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor grow maybe you could talk about
that a little bit yeah, yeah, so Another
[SPEAKER_01]: friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an older guy like three or four years
older than me something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah He has a few plants in his backyard
and I just got to kind of see the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: process from start to finish, you know And
like he went on vacation or some shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: I watered him for a week for him And that
was like the first time that I ever like
[SPEAKER_01]: even had my hand in it really,
you know other than that it was just Like
[SPEAKER_01]: peek into the grow room see somebody doing
something That's cool, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was just a handful of times And I
saw a few other people's little tent grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit, you know in their apartment they
were just like little Trap grow kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you know back when weed was worth
like four thousand a pound But I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really grow myself until I think I was
like 25 when I moved up to Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: because that was like the first time I had
my own place and I lived on this big old
[SPEAKER_01]: lot and Boy, I had plenty of power and a
bedroom and I started slow I just got like
[SPEAKER_01]: a more like a four-bulb t5 like one of
those VHS t5s and I bought some clones and
[SPEAKER_01]: my girlfriend is now my wife was just like
what the fuck You know and then like one
[SPEAKER_01]: day Got like a little I think it was like
a 250 Watt HPS Because it's just so hot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I didn't have any of that shit
figured out yet I just had this like bacon
[SPEAKER_01]: hot room with some clones and I was like
just slowly figuring it out But my buddy's
[SPEAKER_01]: dad had given me the Jorge Cervantes like
grow Bible or whatever And I still have it
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like the back covers like gone
from ripping it off for crutches and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was my buddy's dad's coffee and
that kind of got me through the first like
[SPEAKER_01]: year or two of like trying to figure it
out and like trying to build a grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't go to a hundred degrees
during the day, you know And so What at
[SPEAKER_01]: one point I just took my student loan
money That was like all the money I needed
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat for a few months and I just went
bought like a tent But like a 600 watt HPS
[SPEAKER_01]: like air-cooled and like the full setup
And I got some public clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first time I had like a real
clone, you know that I knew what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro, hey, we're real growers doing
real shit in real houses No, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a tiny house to audio audio quality
is something I've learned over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple episodes That's just going to go up
and down stream yard that we're using is
[SPEAKER_00]: just not something The best shit and more
growers, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not fucking technical wizards So
guys gals we do it watching and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: stand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize You know, just I don't know
what to tell them, you know, it is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But uh, I'm just thankful to have guests
Yeah, yeah, well that was telling somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: in the discord the other day the average
do that there were average people that
[SPEAKER_00]: watch her show or like 35 plus uh,
so Most of them are gonna have kids and
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs and shit So I do apologize,
but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But uh, so on your first day, did you
really?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you you watch all these people do these
gross things grows and stuff as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up and you finally get your Your
crib and when you turn 25 and you do your
[SPEAKER_00]: first row like a lot of got a lot of
people the few guests I've had on so far
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said, you know, they didn't really
make it through their first grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff Were you at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you kind of know enough that you were
able to kind of make it through your first
[SPEAKER_00]: few grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: These like, you know, or was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just didn't take it long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like way too easy I was like man
like I didn't understand the whole like
[SPEAKER_01]: days to harvest and how it Like I didn't
know that much about like strings stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and like how they all differ like that I
just knew that they smoke them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like each one gave you a
different effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I like that like this I like
that but um, it I was like a I'm a late
[SPEAKER_01]: bloomer in like I always just feel like
it's like every ten years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, holy shit retarded for like But
yeah like that bubble grow came out like
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just super light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the thing I was struggling with was
like everyone I knew was getting like a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound of light was like good, you know
What you should be getting is more than
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know and anything over that's
acceptable, you know, but I was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: like What am I doing but little I was
harvesting public like 49 days That 45
[SPEAKER_00]: days I think you know between over
watering and pulling early and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's some of the biggest thing
with new growers because I did the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and because they swell so much in
those last few weeks grow like if you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pulling like You're eager beaver,
especially in your first fucking few grows
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is like exciting, bro I mean,
I want to say my first few grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably definitely hell even Grows now
sometimes if I'm in a pinch bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I need some weed I'll pull a couple
plants early just just to get it going
[SPEAKER_00]: just I told told you before the podcast I
ran out of weed like a month ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: so sometimes You know when you grow that's
the thing when people don't talk about I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like Growing your own pot is really
cool and shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah But the biggest thing for me is
like, you know Obviously once you find
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that you really enjoy and shit like
that, bro You can get a perpetual harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: going but where I pop pop a lot of seeds
and I want to try new shit and I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more Exploratorial shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't keep a lot of cuts of stuff a lot
of times I'll lean in Things easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the same thing and pop hella shit and
I keep a clone of fucking everything Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like my veg turnover is like a burden
I do I do now though, bro It took me
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking two days because I haven't cloned
the whole lot So I didn't rub a good
[SPEAKER_00]: system down, but I literally cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say a lot of fucking clones,
dude Iraq for but my point is Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting hot now getting lost They're
on train of thought but oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but but normally I'll lean into like
re-veg a lot But this I fucked up last
[SPEAKER_00]: time with the skank dog my favorite plant
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Irene s1 from CSI and a skank dog
And bro, I got thrips and like normally I
[SPEAKER_00]: have no problem re-vegging but but dude
like the the thrips just ate up the last
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of Vegetation that was there
and I just it fucked me bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just ended up I just was Like,
you know if I found this in one pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, I'll find something better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's you know You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I thought that maybe but I
Popped another pack this run and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one structurally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously that doesn't mean shit But
something I'm more excited about and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping the bullets came out come out the
same Structure cuz like last time the
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps and like the smoke and the high was
all pretty consistent like the everything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that was all consistent But the
structure of the actual plant and the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure was the main differences on each
plant But something I'm excited about this
[SPEAKER_00]: run, bro Is I'm I'm doing full can of
terror run dude full full pumpin dude And
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one in this tent here bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is literally it's it's in it's
stretch right now It's like ten days in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower bro and that motherfucker off
the top of the pot Is almost five foot
[SPEAKER_00]: tall bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm The last one I grew that really
liked it was only two foot when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and end up about three foot or
so a couple of the other ones I got going
[SPEAKER_00]: are that similar structure with this one
here is a monster and it's got really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: Internotal spacing bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping it stacks like the last one
They all stacked really nice bro from top
[SPEAKER_00]: to bottom and I've trained this one a
little bit So I'm kind of I'm hyped for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I brought you gotta be careful with
me on these cuz I get high and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk forever about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you're up in humble, bro You're
getting you got your little crib.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking growing You know,
are you just doing this for yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I ever asked you something you
don't want to answer bro, feel free not to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer it But at one at some point do you
try to make some money off this shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you just fucking are you just in it
for the experience or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking or a little bit of all I feel like
I was like most people where it's like you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't afford to smoke as much weed as you
would like to and so you got to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something like as far as either selling a
few extra baggies or Mainly just yeah for
[SPEAKER_01]: personal smoke, you know Cuz I found after
that bubba run and maybe like one or two
[SPEAKER_01]: other ones I don't remember like I got
some of these like Mendocino clones that
[SPEAKER_01]: was just like Red and blue with like a
number after them and I remember looking
[SPEAKER_01]: it up at the time and there was
information but I can't remember what the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking numbers were anymore and so Like I
kind of wish I remember what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: just to like even Look back at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I somewhat in Mendocino But I found the
blue drink A PRC it's like a It's closed
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it was like the coolest
dispenser for the longest time but But I
[SPEAKER_01]: got the blue dream cut and I just started
cropping shit Like I just kept growing
[SPEAKER_01]: only that because it yielded so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was such an easy to grow plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was Even taking it to 77 and it's still
yielded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I would think I would only
take it to like 63 60, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still in that like trying to figure
that part out That's one of those ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of people fucking fucking rand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't it out there for today By the
time I was growing this was like 2015
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really cared about it even when you
grew it like triple-a gorgeous unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: love to smoke It like nobody gave us a
fuck right now I would bring like a pound
[SPEAKER_01]: of it to somewhere and they'd be like,
yo If you look 1200 bucks for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like pounds were gone for like 24,
you know, yeah, so it's like nothing What
[SPEAKER_00]: what would that have been about Would that
been what year would that have been when
[SPEAKER_00]: people were fucking with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know because it seems like it was
coming to Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working at this factory around I
want to say it was like Said graduating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh seven start working at factory like
four years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have been what like 2010
2011 I was hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was like I think it was late
2000s early 20 teams Even but it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still knew people that crafted outdoors,
but they were like really big scale Like
[SPEAKER_01]: just like gnarly outdoor dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like Hell's Angels bikers shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably we were getting bro
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the guys in our discord pop
goat farm He's got a blue dream s1 that he
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's made and I find that pretty easy
to grow I can definitely you know Say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to grow and a lot of the people in
the discord do really well with it So if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested in any kind of blue
dream type of vibes, it's up on that site
[SPEAKER_00]: over at riot seeds Dot com or I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually I think he sold out of the s
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're sold out but In my
opinion like the wet dream the green crack
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dream cross was like I'd almost
prefer that Yeah But it just has that
[SPEAKER_01]: sweeter vibe to it instead of like the
straight dryer sheets, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that I had dryer sheets I I really
liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the I Liked everything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't one that I wanted to keep
only I mean I ran that One in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: contest and I think we only got like two
or three seeds of it So, I mean obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't I mean I need to be running
numbers even like getting kind of real Dad
[SPEAKER_00]: on that that particular cross,
but I would say I'm more I liked it a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: something I talked about all the time with
that particular cross was How like three
[SPEAKER_00]: months down the road in my dry out tent I
had a tent at the other crib I had when I
[SPEAKER_00]: ran it I had cleaned it out even after I
had cured and dried to the or dried the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dryer sheets in that tent and that fucking
tent still smelled like dryer sheets like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dank as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I think I don't think I'm just not
a big Fruity turd guy no matter what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like some of the blue stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the blue dreams cool I like some of
Matt's blueberry work and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really like She makes fun of me cuz
I like raunchy nasty shit like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know gassy skunky rank like oniony
garlicky any kind of in that range,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like Bubba's Coffee kind of obs
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it all but The Z King can you talk
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I don't know if you can't even talk
about some of this shit But at a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point I think you do get a job in the
industry and I don't know if you can even
[SPEAKER_00]: talk About any of that shit, but uh if you
can at what point did that happen and
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspired you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean obviously probably Financial
reasons, but is there something what led
[SPEAKER_00]: up to that if you can't even if you can't
talk about it Maybe you can talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what led up to getting into the industry I
guess basically yeah, so like after The
[SPEAKER_01]: market crashed out like you know we didn't
we paid our expenses for that year,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we made like a small Little amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I didn't have enough money to
like Replant like five first like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just like and I didn't want to go I
was just like yeah This is like some
[SPEAKER_01]: killer greenhouse and like you want it for
400 bucks a pound you know like fuck that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know and and it didn't recover I was
like maybe it's just like a phase I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know wave of it, and it didn't at
all and so like I'm glad I did get out but
[SPEAKER_01]: I came back and I went back up into the
mountains of my Hometown in northern Napa
[SPEAKER_01]: County, and I was working on this
vegetable farm And like I just couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: find a place to live out there because
I've been tons of fires glass like five
[SPEAKER_01]: ten years Then it just like displaced like
so many people no rentals to find all like
[SPEAKER_01]: three grand and the ten grand a month you
know It's too much, and I was making like
[SPEAKER_01]: normal vegetable farmer money You know and
so that job was sick, but I needed to find
[SPEAKER_01]: something better And so I was just looking
for a job and like I applied for it I
[SPEAKER_01]: found one that was just like a plant
breeder job and It was for a big
[SPEAKER_01]: California company, and I was just like
fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good money And like I've always
wanted to do this like for real because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like played around making seeds and
like tried to like Half-ass start like a
[SPEAKER_01]: little seed company, but like never really
put the time into it, so I was like You
[SPEAKER_01]: know like you're fucking busy And so I
just never put enough time into that side
[SPEAKER_01]: of it and so I just had the opportunity to
get the job and They kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that that company wanted it's like
asking for like a unicorn because they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted someone with like a full plant
science like Ground with a bachelor's
[SPEAKER_01]: degree minimum preferably a master's
degree Ain't that fucking phrase you see
[SPEAKER_01]: it all the time of plant science and Then
but also with like a full black market
[SPEAKER_01]: weed grower skill set right now and like
know the market know the culture know
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that you want to know about
like seed lines and people and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, so I managed to get the job like
pretty immediately My day one No,
[SPEAKER_01]: like within the first like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I just kind of realized that like
they designed a job that Guaranteed that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone you worked with kind of hated And
all I did was make work for people when
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're doing a new seed pop grow is
gonna get inundated with like hundreds and
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of new plants that all have to be
individually packed and Like doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: metric for all that shit's a pain in the
ass because you're literally weighing out
[SPEAKER_01]: every fucking phenotype It's just a
nightmare, and then they all have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmed separately So it's like a specials
trim scene for it, too And then it all has
[SPEAKER_01]: to be packaged and jarred for like people
to evaluate it and all that so like you
[SPEAKER_01]: just like There's no way around it That
person is gonna be like maybe they like
[SPEAKER_01]: you as a person, but they hate that you
exist at that company And then they they
[SPEAKER_01]: had kind of like a corporate like Like it
was like a Selection based by committee
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean and like everyone's
like was weighted differently on like what
[SPEAKER_01]: their vote was and shit and obviously like
the owners are way up here all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: down to me it was like on the But doesn't
count at all right and so like there was
[SPEAKER_01]: just never any opportunity to do real
plant breeding Which just like cross this
[SPEAKER_01]: and that together pick out the one that
they think smells the best Looks the best
[SPEAKER_01]: and then like keep testing it and
eventually it may become a commercial you
[SPEAKER_01]: know But it was just like it was just like
there was no you couldn't do multi-step
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and if you do it was
[SPEAKER_01]: They would just sort through it Are you
are you are you working with cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you working with the seed pops
specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah constantly acquiring every clone
you can find and Also, they acquired their
[SPEAKER_01]: own seeds from like events that people
would give them Stuff that they would buy
[SPEAKER_01]: that was super hyped up, but everything
that was super hype Just like oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like mom like it was straight trash
And these are from like the biggest some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the biggest companies with the biggest
names that charge 300 bucks per pack of 10
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds You know and it was just fucking
trash do So I mean you get this job right
[SPEAKER_00]: and you say with it pretty quickly you
realize you don't Like it I mean how long
[SPEAKER_00]: do you end up staying there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you I guess yeah, like how
long did you end up staying there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe like what after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you end up get getting into did
you continue to look for other work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry or did you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang up the towel or maybe you could talk
about to the the end of it I guess Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I was there for a year and two or three
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stuck it out I was just like it's
paying my bills and I got to do a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that they never asked me to do But
like because it's research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like totally cool because if it leads
somewhere cool, then they can be like
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we totally wanted you to do that,
you know, and I was like figuring things
[SPEAKER_01]: out about reversals and Pollen quality and
reversals doing some microscopy with that
[SPEAKER_01]: helping them out mildly with a tissue
culture just like looking through their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and throwing ideas in their brain
and shit, but um It uh, I was just so
[SPEAKER_01]: unhappy there and I apparently rubbed
someone the wrong way Because he went to
[SPEAKER_01]: HR and was just like this dude hates his
job We don't like him like get him the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck out of here and I was gone like
immediately then Yeah, it's funny cuz that
[SPEAKER_01]: dude talked more shit than fucking anyone
about everyone at the company the owners
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone involved that the dude that
ratted me out was like The biggest hater
[SPEAKER_00]: of all time He sucked it growing Oh,
he probably wanted your job bro or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, you know Yeah, I was just
bringing the vibe down and I knew it too,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it was like it was Whether I
left or they like didn't like me anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: But I knew my boss hated me pretty
immediately to like my direct manager He
[SPEAKER_01]: knew that he couldn't like manage me,
you know, because it's like how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: manage someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like He didn't have any real
industry experience before this he was
[SPEAKER_01]: just a science speaker playing scientists,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like there was nothing he could tell
me about my job Besides like the politics
[SPEAKER_01]: of the people in the company that like I
didn't already know more, you know And he
[SPEAKER_01]: never wanted to even collab on anything I
was always trying to get him to help me
[SPEAKER_01]: like do my stats and shit and get my like
data collection like really finds me and
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he just never gave a fuck and he
never wanted to invest any time in it So I
[SPEAKER_01]: was just like if he doesn't want to manage
me he thinks I'm a pain in the fucking ass
[SPEAKER_01]: like I have all these fucking ideas and
shit So it's just like it's funny that
[SPEAKER_01]: because I actually wanted to do the real
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It eventually led to me Getting booted out
You know, well, it's a couple things I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to make a point on was I can
totally relate to you when you're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that your job basically was making people
hate you because you're making work for
[SPEAKER_00]: them when I used to mow for a long time
for a living bro cut grass and shit and I
[SPEAKER_00]: got hired on obviously the bottom just a
weed eater guy and then within a year I
[SPEAKER_00]: was the manager of the whole crew and all
that shit and that was my job,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I loved it I love making a
motherfucker hate me dude because these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys fuck with me for like a year working
there because I had no experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: mowing and so this shit I don't mean
because like I didn't that's where all
[SPEAKER_00]: these weird jokes come from and shit
because they would do that shit to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck with me shit, right and Ended up I
became their boss eventually bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: and and I loved it at that point cuz I was
fucking you know But but and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something else like you were saying the
morale that's something when you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a physical fucking job You need everybody
on point It's just like playing a sport or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like if your your heads not in
the game if you're partying out at late at
[SPEAKER_00]: night and you're coming in drunk and
hungover next day and nobody else is and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not doing the same level of work
it's it sets a bad tone because You know
[SPEAKER_00]: in Kentucky bro when it's 98 degrees and
88 percent humidity and we're out there
[SPEAKER_00]: doing these horse farm fences for fucking
20 miles, bro And you're over here hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: on the fence and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't respect you anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, it's the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my other thing I wanted to say it
sounds like you kind of wanted to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: sound you sounded like you were wanting to
more get into like Get into it to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like yours you were talking about it was
experiment and play and breed and learn
[SPEAKER_00]: and really they kind of just want you to
come in and do what the fuck they want you
[SPEAKER_00]: to do and make money and that was it and
kind of soul-sucking at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cuz you're you're literally just
working for the check and like I mean we
[SPEAKER_00]: all need to make money because we all have
families and bills, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with the three or four thousand
dollars fucking rent you guys got out
[SPEAKER_00]: there but But there I think especially
when you talk about something like this
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a hobby or passion project or
passion Hobby for a lot of people I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be very soul-sucking because I
talked about this before On other podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: is like for me even there's a limit and
it's usually like four or five six lights
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point anything after that I start
to get not into it now I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: from the standpoint of like in my house
like a normal ass house with the setup in
[SPEAKER_00]: a room or a couple rooms You know,
that's not I'm not talking about like a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility where it's like, you know stream
on to do large shit But I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: just putting up some tents in your crib I
could say after After about five six
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, dude, I'm it's not that I can't
maintain all that work It's just not as
[SPEAKER_00]: fun as it as it is for me because we're
talking about Cloning and shit earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: like stuff like that If I got to do too
much that shit it is work at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as it's not as fun for me So
but that being said I fucking sucked it up
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz ain't no little sissy and I cloned
everything out this fucking run cuz I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned my lesson but but so You leave
this job and you and I wanted to ask one
[SPEAKER_00]: more question about that in it in it You
probably are answered it for me But did
[SPEAKER_00]: you learn anything at all other than not
to deal with certain types of people
[SPEAKER_00]: again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess or not probably nothing from the
growing aspect of it or do you pick up
[SPEAKER_01]: from the growing side?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of stupid shit on the growing
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I learned how to grab From the
nursery manager he was a really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he had more of a background Science
degree he was a really cool But I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what I mainly learned I suck at playing
politics, you know, you can't be up front
[SPEAKER_01]: and like say what's on your mind
Everybody's playing the long game and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I'm just not a slimy piece of shit
like that I've got to see a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_01]: plants like I got to see so much shit as
far as like all the modern stuff I know So
[SPEAKER_01]: many cuts that I'll never work with and I
know exactly why I'll never work with them
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like there's nothing to find
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's literally nothing like you will
never find something Going different even
[SPEAKER_01]: without crossing, you know, it's just like
it's just too much of the same and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to learn a lot more about reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's one thing I've got to like
really fine-tune and play around with Like
[SPEAKER_01]: so many different commercial sprays and
then like started developing my own and
[SPEAKER_01]: like it works for me But like we've been
trying it out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know still got some pickups
to go through and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe it's just like For me it's
like I can When you know your plants like
[SPEAKER_01]: you can read it and like no one did just
like do a little less here Maybe lower the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's hard to put that in
instructions for someone else,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know And so I guess that's more what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we're trying it out and I'm
like, here's some blanket instructions and
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't work And so it's like alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, that's where we need to
find tune It's just like is it
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it number of applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just be flexible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just not a viable product because
you have to be like in the moment
[SPEAKER_01]: flexible?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can I can I can relate because I know
the guys will all joke on autoflowers but
[SPEAKER_00]: like trying to tell somebody how to grow
an auto flower the right way is so
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult because I feel like to get a I
mean, I personally don't think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: good for new beginner people I think they
would be good for a new beginner if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have experience with plants in general And
you understand like how to properly water
[SPEAKER_00]: How to properly feed a plant how to look
for signs of deficiencies or pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all kinds of things I
think a lot of people get fucked up on
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers is they come into it from a
The way they would treat a traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as far as like how much light how
much nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sauce pots they're putting in and how
close to lights are to them shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, especially with these modern Autos
if you know what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very easy to grow but I think that
They can have their pitfalls for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower in particular but I can totally
relate and Trying to explain to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a new grower or even someone
that's not and just hasn't fucked with
[SPEAKER_00]: them and it's a tail son whenever I see
somebody It's like yeah, I'm fucked with
[SPEAKER_00]: some autos and they they you know,
they show me a picture and it's this
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking auto That's like this tall and I'm
sitting here like literally right now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking across the room at like fucking
eight autos and they're all as tall as the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking traditional plants right next to
them and they're Half the age so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know for me when I see shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay Well, you probably pumped
them a little bit too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably there's something you've
probably done wrong But uh not to go off
[SPEAKER_00]: on a tangent about auto flowers,
but that's something I have a hard time
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining to people you have to Dial it
down a lot and speaking of it since we're
[SPEAKER_00]: already on the topic You said you fucked
with autos a little bit back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you and you were talking about low
rotters and shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about anything on auto
flowers at all your experience with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was working Growing some like it was
after my I moved up to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working with these guys doing some
outdoor projects It was like during the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp rush and shit, you know It was like,
you know kind of free to do as you will
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so much weed plants around
everywhere You know, it's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of off the radar If you just
have this like small little farm because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like, you know, multi hundred acre
farms a week now Yeah, so I needed auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers We needed oil so I bought some
pretty well down the seed company Ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking I was like we paid like a
home brand, you know for like 10,000 seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: a dollar a piece You know, and I was just
like fucking talking about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I didn't realize easy reversals
aren't So Ended up in like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: 120 of them and separated them out by like
flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: Reversed a handful of them just made them
let them all hit They were killers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I found really nice plants in
there even in the original stock and then
[SPEAKER_01]: my buddy and I both grew those the next
year for the outdoor season and they
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking crushed everything that he He had
like nine other varieties from other
[SPEAKER_01]: people and like the shit that I made was
just like Massive yielding super resonance
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was just like cool man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's all just going to biomass,
you know, it's all just uh turning into
[SPEAKER_01]: carts and shit, so But uh, that was it was
a fun project it taught me just like it
[SPEAKER_01]: got me organized You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean where I'm like, alright,
you know, like it got me to start like
[SPEAKER_01]: doing real like notes on stuff and like
starting to separate plants by
[SPEAKER_01]: Characteristics and traits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think autos are really good way to get
into breeding honestly because you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn a lot of fundamentals and like start
looking at like Recessive versus dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: genes if you're like making a new auto and
stuff like that so And you can also just
[SPEAKER_01]: like shorten flower time or make things so
sorry not short flower times like turn
[SPEAKER_01]: things into like early trigger plants
Where it's just like maybe you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: an auto plant, but it's gonna start
flowering like mid-july instead of Where
[SPEAKER_01]: you first see it like early to mid-august?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, so I'm just a lot of stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely a cool experience I
didn't ever get back into it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I made a ton of those I grew
them for what I needed them for ever since
[SPEAKER_01]: then they've just been collecting dust in
my fridge, but I probably have like I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know 20,000 auto seeds of like a
couple dozen or like maybe a dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties and they're all like lowrider
Like you see a lowrider pop up wearing
[SPEAKER_01]: every single line just like kind of midsy
But resinous fruity, you know purple
[SPEAKER_01]: trees, you know, I guess exactly what you
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh it's in everything Yeah, you still see
so I've spent the last couple years
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting basically the best and see this
is this is something that the reason why I
[SPEAKER_00]: started making auto season on the side
because The selection of what you have on
[SPEAKER_00]: the modern-day market is and probably back
then too is horrible Like you can't find
[SPEAKER_00]: regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very few people with regs There's
like two or three breeders that will drop
[SPEAKER_00]: some and they have dropped some or they
carry them in So I got into it because
[SPEAKER_00]: when I first started growing again They're
just a way I was able to have a perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest of some kind when I only had a
couple tents And people people get it
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think I started with daughters,
but I actually started with Just
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional plants one of my first seeds
what seed bank was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: From it was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at Seasman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Seasman in Europe Seasman,
I think Seasman was one of the first place
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually ordered and I didn't order any
autos my first first run some of the plate
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I picked up was from like a seeds
and like I still remember that's the one
[SPEAKER_00]: one One of the packs I remember was a
little fucking tin can bro the round tin
[SPEAKER_00]: can said a seeds on you push it down to
pop open all the shit and I got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit from there, but to keep it on autos
something I find it really interesting is
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn learning about breeding and
something else that I found a My goal of
[SPEAKER_00]: recent with him at least is to find a more
of a og or a key Kim leaning or just a
[SPEAKER_00]: rank smelling auto flower because you're
right a lot of profiles are more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity profiles or I know that Matt has
said this stuff like grape or Other
[SPEAKER_00]: certain profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know specifically with grape will carry
over into other plants pretty easily So I
[SPEAKER_00]: have seen a lot of that type of shit But
then he last few fucking runs,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude and it's really interesting because I
had a huge amount of my auto seeds were
[SPEAKER_00]: from about two or three years ago and I
ran a bunch of those last run and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: ran a bunch of the more literally the most
modern audience you can get like from all
[SPEAKER_00]: the most recent drops and the last like
three or four months and I've ran a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of them a few times before but anyways my
point is as I found a few that are
[SPEAKER_00]: insanely Resonance dude, and I'm fucking
hyped for them And what's fucking funny is
[SPEAKER_00]: we make fun of hype shit all the time,
but I think the answer to increase you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Some of these autos at least the way
they look and and the their frost appeal
[SPEAKER_00]: or their appeal and things like that
especially because I'll be honest There
[SPEAKER_00]: are some that pop up that look like dog
shit that like when you look at them there
[SPEAKER_00]: But but that being said when you're
running 20 or 30 of them at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be three or four of them out of
them that will pop out and I got some now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've crossed I made a few crosses And
stuff and I'm getting stuff like funk I am
[SPEAKER_00]: getting still some berry and banana and
strawberry like funky plants and pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: shit I do like those but I'm leaning away
from the more grapey floral Type of auto
[SPEAKER_00]: like traditional kind of vibes you get and
some of these these leaves on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these more modern ones, bro I've shown
them and test them on people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: discord They can't tell fucking difference
one bro and some of the frost on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the the fucking like fan leaves in the
water They're all the just the frost on
[SPEAKER_00]: them is awesome and the smells bro,
bro Some of them are day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dank though, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are this last run that did with some
of these in particular I took them down
[SPEAKER_00]: with me to Kentucky when my dad was going
through shit and I was smoking on a bro
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were I wouldn't say they hold up
to like a the top-tier H&L See,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but they are better than a lot
of rec weed that I've had They are better
[SPEAKER_00]: than like I say this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often the best auto Those are
always as good as some of the worst seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find in like a pack sometimes like
if you pop a pack of you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, your average traditional plant not
the best one in the pack It's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: on that level a lot of times but for the
speed and what you're bringing back into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding I thought was interesting is you
know your male My whole goal is to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of reg auto so I could fuck around and
learn more about breeding and the
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing about the males they're
jumping melon They're starting to dump
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen at week three and four so you can
do these really quick turnaround So like
[SPEAKER_00]: for example when I broke everything down
from my last run where I went back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky for a while to visit dad and The
thrips I came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm starting everything from seeds so I
literally just started flipping two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ago on all the stuff that I popped and All
the autos I popped at the same time are
[SPEAKER_00]: about two weeks out from finishing flower
So they're they're great for utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: them like that if you are You know,
you're restarting you have no flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they gonna fucking rip your head off
every time you smoking fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but if you Enjoy growing weed and like
to look at plants and and we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about that unknowns earlier Something that
it tickles my fancy and it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: something about running a lot of a pack a
lot of the same pack It's great for
[SPEAKER_00]: finding obviously great expressions and
keepers and outlier Plants and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but it's sometimes if they're all
really it's like skin dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great plant But because it is so
consistent, it's not that exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got ADHD, bro So I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see random color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see all kinds of different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So The autos I think they're they're here
to stay in my garden at least dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they have their purpose,
man That's why I like I'm done on rants on
[SPEAKER_01]: this on the fucking server and shit where
it's just like dude y'all so much of
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking haters like everybody wants to
hate on Everyone wants to hate on auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like dude that shit's just like even
That is like a cultural thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking old news.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not the cool guy Yeah, like there's
good cookies cuts You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've had some that are like maybe
they're not gonna get you like high Every
[SPEAKER_01]: single day and like to blast you off in
outer space over and over and over again
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of these older cuts like I build
up a tolerance to the older cuts,
[SPEAKER_01]: too There's only a few that like always
cut through you know, but it's just like I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like smoking the same kind of We'd
more than like a few days in a row,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I'm always switching it up by
time of day like I like having all of it
[SPEAKER_01]: all the fucking time My old-school shit
depending on who's coming over I may roll
[SPEAKER_01]: something up different just to like keep
them comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I've said it before It's like
you get like a person who wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: casually smoke like a few times a year at
like a dinner party or some shit Like you
[SPEAKER_01]: give them some fucking I don't know like
56 day or some shit like they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking die
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people may think that's me or
whatever it's like no man like I want
[SPEAKER_01]: people to smoke more shit Oh, and so it's
just like if you need some old lady weed
[SPEAKER_01]: like I got some old lady weed for you
because I keep it around because it's good
[SPEAKER_00]: like At least taste good, you know,
my wife she she you know, she doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke As much as I do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I can relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I give her some like The fucking
something from H&L dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's too much and she's asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm if she's asleep How am I
gonna cash in my fucking tokens?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm saying no, but another thing
bro since I started doing these fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcasts and like tonight where we're
recording it later Like by the time the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day comes bro, if I've been
smoking heady shit all day, bro I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: just I'm not I'm getting tongue-tied Last
episode I got real fucked up and by the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of it I said like every five seconds
like like like sounding like somebody we
[SPEAKER_00]: know 20 years ago or whatever,
but But yeah, I mean sorry about the auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all the guys in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be But yeah, no, you're right
about that hate on everything has its
[SPEAKER_00]: place man You're right about that because
at the party brother remember I pulled out
[SPEAKER_00]: some rec we rolled it up for him and
nobody knew nobody knows like it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: band-aid he's one blunt or joint and then
like a Thing of runs and then like back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking H&L's like some you know,
we're there's a bunch of mango crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so it's just like, you know,
like I didn't But like I once again smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a hater, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am super stoked on that mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got the A.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haze and it's like Three or four weeks out
and it just looks amazing No smells coming
[SPEAKER_01]: to really like fucking killing And I only
grew two fucking seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ours probably like five and I got
three males You know, but out of two
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, they're both fucking look like
they're gonna be killer smug, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially one one looks crazy like H&L
was like that one looks like it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: hurt Yeah, yeah, yeah that's probably a
little closer because the peas not long
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, you know, I think I got three
that are like the shorter flowering ones
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe like I'm at 10 weeks now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they'll go like 11 maybe 12 on
a few of them and then I got one that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go like 14 or 15, but P Haze is P Haze is
a sweet pea times band-aid haze number
[SPEAKER_00]: seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is and it was sweet PG from
Local of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I looked up his grow log.
[SPEAKER_01]: He posted some photos of like finished
flower and like them it's like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bittersweet channel and the grow logs and
Those plants are like the spitting image
[SPEAKER_01]: of the peel eners like it's a dominant
fucking plant even as the reversal like
[SPEAKER_01]: the pollen over I like the I only got one
that's I got the worst luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got mostly satina Lee leaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I mean, I'm taking a guess,
you know here I guess that's what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were right now I'd have smoked sweet pea
so I could pick up on the pea leaners
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two that stood out on like the
eight or nine that were they came up there
[SPEAKER_00]: were or whatever that I finished and I
smoked on that sweet pea or I smoked on
[SPEAKER_00]: the P Haze for a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the last shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to smoke up because I smoked up the
two expressions that I wrote I really
[SPEAKER_00]: liked for like way before that and ended
up smoking the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but yeah, man I'm not a big,
you know, I think H&L he told me I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: like SSH There's certain hazes bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's that I've tried so far and then
you're right like on the mango hazes from
[SPEAKER_00]: H &L I really like the electric mango
There's and that we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier about smoking out people with
certain shit I wouldn't smoke people out
[SPEAKER_00]: with any of that fucking shit for the
first time if they don't smoke cuz
[SPEAKER_00]: remember at the fucking party I know I
talked about this fucking party All the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but you were there with me and we
got to share a whole day on a boat
[SPEAKER_00]: actually which was awesome and we have
fucking baked but uh, but but that That
[SPEAKER_00]: whole trip we were smoking a lot of the H
&L crosses of the mango hazes and that one
[SPEAKER_00]: night dude I think it was the first time
we were there Rob Clark and myself and a
[SPEAKER_00]: few other I was trying to go lay down
because we had to get up and what like six
[SPEAKER_00]: to go fish and Man, I'm laying in bed And
I'm fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I closed my eyes and I feel like see shit
like racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm race.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind's racing like Rob Clark said he
tried to lay down and he got back up to
[SPEAKER_00]: and Back up like five times He said I saw
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say eyelid movies or something
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I wouldn't recommend smoking that
sleep at all on that shit We were smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: band-aid haze until like fucking three in
the morning every night You're not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking sleep for those two hours that you
go Yeah, I was kind of just like huh,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was sleeping on the couch so like I
had to like wait till everyone went Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jump into the next segment and
kind of get I wanted to ask you a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: things about some of the more modern
Modern varieties that maybe you might have
[SPEAKER_00]: some information on The first the first
one and this confused me at first cuz I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really fuck with a lot of modern
shit other than like some auto stuff Can
[SPEAKER_00]: you explain the different shirbs or
sunset?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunset shirbs and stuff like that and
there were maybe the green shirb in any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of way because that that confused the
fuck out of me and I'm sure it is for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of new growers and people that might
be watching too Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when sherbet came out The first one I
saw was this and it was the green shirt
[SPEAKER_01]: and I thought it was a nice little plant
like outside I never had any issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: it Like herming or anything and I saw like
I used to run some trim scenes when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: in college then too And like I saw plenty
of it like it wasn't loaded with seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit But I guess it was kind of common on
indoor I'm actually growing a hybrid of it
[SPEAKER_01]: right now that I made back then and it
hermed fucking Everywhere and not just
[SPEAKER_01]: like once early in flower late in flower
like the whole time fucking through top to
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom Yeah, just like on the tip of every
single like bud site Yeah, just like one
[SPEAKER_01]: or two bananas sticking out And like one
of them seeded itself super heavy But
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, it's besides the point like and
then a little bit later the sunset was
[SPEAKER_01]: released I think they were kind of holding
that one a little more tight and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just purple and it had a little bit of
like like Creamy gas where the other one
[SPEAKER_01]: was like creamies like lime, you know,
like like kind of citrus but not tangy at
[SPEAKER_01]: all You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's definitely more like a key
lime pie kind of thing got you or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just like and that's what people think the
green sure been the key lime or the same
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know Like I drew the key lime
a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like super long inner nodes and
like the green sure of stack, you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks kind of like just Sunset sure
with no purple, you know It had that
[SPEAKER_01]: modern gelato look where I don't feel like
the the key lime did it kind of had like
[SPEAKER_01]: This rounded top and shit, but nobody has
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met one dude on Instagram and said he
still has it I don't know man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they they say that it's Girl Scout
cookies across the pink panties Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, you know, I never saw pink panties
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would
[SPEAKER_01]: really like Sunset Sunset was shit had a
cut until like two years ago when all my
[SPEAKER_01]: mom's Like 115 degree heat wave lasted for
two weeks And so like my plants were just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting baked and they were dark and you
know, it was right Everything succumbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like 20 clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically like every cookies cut like
all the original Like I had four of them
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had fucking Sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have I never got a whole line and
lost them all but Yeah Sunset was fired I
[SPEAKER_01]: still want to cut back Like it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is is like even the guys on
the big companies that are like connected
[SPEAKER_01]: to those people Originally and like grew
for them like they came You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in someone's garden someone You know,
but uh, so yeah, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the s1 that Caleb has on his
website?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that gonna is that gonna be the the
green chirp?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess That's the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he did do the green service one And
when I think Sean and local both group And
[SPEAKER_01]: all he's buying is more green shirt You
know, like there's no like clues to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like it's just all more green and
so I like those curbs, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're yeah, I had uh, I had a
couple of the sweet pea I think it was it
[SPEAKER_00]: was I think it was a sweet his local sweet
meat times the one of the s ones I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it was of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure but I had a pack I had
a pack of my random and actually did I
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking The ones that came out fruity or
kind of they came out kind of candy almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like a pixie stick kind of Kind of Bob
those weren't a super super potent that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're cool like the flavor and the
smells were really cool when you open the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar But the peeling or ones dude,
they had this like that mouse savory
[SPEAKER_00]: raunchiness tone a little bit of
fruitiness tone but not like like more
[SPEAKER_00]: what in my tone with what I like,
you know, but They were cool Like we said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, you know, I'm younger and you're
younger as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in our mid and early 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, I grew up flipping some of
the stuff and there are some stuff that is
[SPEAKER_00]: modern that I actually enjoy myself I
think I think we you know, maybe we could
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of summit the modern conversation up
with it's not that I think that people
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you know this better than I do
It's it's what it all stands for right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it would if it didn't go the
way it did with it all maybe You know
[SPEAKER_00]: without shitting on a bunch of people and
getting drama You know if it didn't go the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it all did it maybe it wouldn't have
been the way but I agree With you being
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've tested out extensively all the
fucking rec stores or stores I could find
[SPEAKER_00]: in Michigan bro that are in my general
area it would suffer still like 20
[SPEAKER_00]: something now and made multiple visits to
them and shit and Man, there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: in that store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what you're looking for I
wouldn't go in there asking the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that work there What what it is because
they're just out the street for looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for a job But it it's one of those deals
where you're gonna have to spend money and
[SPEAKER_00]: find something that you like there I'm not
saying go out And buy a little
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-packaged eights, but like up here
where we're at You can go into still deli
[SPEAKER_00]: styles and then you can actually get like
bulk flour still I know you were saying
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't even get bulk fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all pre-packaged ace issue So that's
not even rules that make it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they just wanted Like because we
had deli style for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even into the beginning of rec
maybe they passed a lot of it at all I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know but um, yeah, it's fucking
wacky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want an ounce?
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta buy
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is stuff a lot of that stuff
you can actually get in the bulk stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: too It'll either have a different name or
just be an older harvest basically So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like yeah, it's not the dankest freshest
shit But like for 40 bucks, you can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of walk out with like a half ounce of
something Pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like compared to compared to from
what you gotta spin Maybe that's part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem with a lot of guys is a lot of
you guys for our own Cali And if it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: bad out there at the rec stores like that
sucks cuz uh I'm not saying we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed or nothing like that in here in
Michigan But I gotta say I can't shit on
[SPEAKER_00]: every single place cuz there are there I
found I found some stuff that was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: decent now given that opportunity or the
choice would I take a bag of homegrown
[SPEAKER_00]: over that of course You know any day I
think at the end of the day like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know when we were talking about
earlier I don't work for a big company and
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have like the space to really pump
stuff so sometimes I do run out of weed so
[SPEAKER_00]: I do got to go get by weed sometimes and
You know over the last year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some stuff that I like what's
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can never say it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got like a third grade reading label the
Dolce de uva I Like that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that reading Yeah, there's a whole
like modern wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like even past my knowledge,
you know, like I know like the origin
[SPEAKER_01]: story now But like where we're at now,
like when people go what's blue sushi
[SPEAKER_01]: about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No interest But I just don't care like all
that shit's like Really one note.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the same high with a little bit
of a flavor modification to the last one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I had a recently I had some stuff
or saw some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's heard of motor breath I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had motor breath before so I
don't know if it's the actual motor breath
[SPEAKER_00]: school But it was actually really nice to
raunchy gassy kind of Yeah, it was fire
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it reminded me bro of a toned down
version of Death Star kind of like not
[SPEAKER_00]: tone way down we just like a kind of
almost like that's I Thought I got burnt
[SPEAKER_00]: pop Corn smells kind of from the Death
Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know but kind of in that range
They do it was the hub and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be the grow of it or whatever the
how was cool It was definitely on the
[SPEAKER_00]: better end of things I would like the more
of the smells and the flavors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: church just that raunchiness bro,
but uh, the last question I had about Some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the more modern shit was you're a Z
man, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is Z?
[SPEAKER_01]: Z is Gittles the originals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, it's a it's some sort of like a
like my personal theory is like a green
[SPEAKER_01]: sure Sweet tooth kind of thing But it's
like it's it's just got this depth to the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit on it You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like you smell so tiny small for
doing it's like strawberry or like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, yeah, that's berry or like that's
great Yeah, this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like it's like when you smell it
like you keep going back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just like Okay, like that's cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's grapefruit You know, like it just
kind of has that depth to it and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what sucks about it Is it when you cross
it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you get some of that like
candiness But you don't get that depth of
[SPEAKER_01]: flavoring aroma to it anymore So like
that's the only thing that I really and it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't do what you want it to So like
it's kind of like my obsession with it is
[SPEAKER_01]: like that it just like making it good I
mean, I don't think it'll ever be coat but
[SPEAKER_01]: like how do you work with it in a way that
like preserves that debt?
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and Other people have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I heard the original ZQ had some
bangers in it, you know and that people
[SPEAKER_01]: have like stabilized that through more
like line breeding in it and so like For
[SPEAKER_01]: me, I'm just trying to find something now
that I like to smoke and it'll just be a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone That maybe I hit other stuff too
when I find cool plants You know just to
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, all right there that's my one
that I throw some pipe and some candy on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know So I'm growing some like
permanent marker cross and And all this
[SPEAKER_01]: one stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to find some cool place Not
like I don't think I'm really gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: continue live breathing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this one I think I've done it and
It's now it's just finding the plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: that line you know, that's like Like
exemplary example of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, yeah, I you know and I like
asking you these kind of questions because
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'll be able to some of
the other people could we even have a Be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to comment on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you shit more modern
leaning questions, too but maybe we could
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about like I know we were kind of
dragging on here a little bit and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: shit you got to do so maybe we can Maybe
we could talk about how?
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point did you kind of get online?
[SPEAKER_00]: And were you like involved with the
forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you watch YouTube videos?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe once you kind of get into
that at what point did you find the mat in
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder syndicate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I didn't really do anything on
them like the forums I didn't know about
[SPEAKER_01]: the good ones and even with forums what
nobody really like says is that you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: just fucking scroll Forever through
endless pages to find what the information
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for or you have to be like
active in the community That's the
[SPEAKER_01]: question but even then like a lot of those
guys are fucking assholes It's gonna like
[SPEAKER_01]: shit on you, you know, and so like I never
had anything to do with the forums I still
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you know, I'm just on the discord
But I think I was driving from Oregon to
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma in my 20 the 2019
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just talking so much shit on
everybody like I knew some of those points
[SPEAKER_01]: just for my White word of mouth from other
people in the industry and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like finally somebody's Not
full of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean this layers guy says exactly what
he's fucking thinking So many of these
[SPEAKER_01]: people are douchebags and nobody fucking
says it And from then I think they plugged
[SPEAKER_01]: his show that it just started I think they
were in the first season and Started
[SPEAKER_01]: migrating over that way because the
podcast got like there was a few good
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews on there And then it got kind
of weird, you know, I mean with the
[SPEAKER_01]: caliber people coming out and shit I
really hate when a weed growing show is
[SPEAKER_01]: just like It always just feels like a plug
for someone's company, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm not there for that You know,
I want to like know like learn something
[SPEAKER_01]: about you your work You're doing like what
you're like working with right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit but like it always just seems like a
softball questions to like plug the
[SPEAKER_00]: company Nowadays bro me my old lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll watch something on YouTube I used to
love watching YouTube and I get on there I
[SPEAKER_00]: say is anything even fucking real anymore
these mother I said the end of this
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking video.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna sell us something watch
there's gonna be a link to something but
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that being said dude,
there is a fine line though because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced this recently and I don't
think you everybody needs to be out here
[SPEAKER_00]: making money off of doing shit but like
when you Do when you are doing shit for
[SPEAKER_00]: people like a podcast or show you you are
creating like value for people so like I
[SPEAKER_00]: do understand when some of these shows do
bring in like sponsors or a brand or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, but I think it's the way they
approach it and it is like you were saying
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like Though everything is like a
question leading up to it whereas like if
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the video You are like five
seconds at the beginning or five seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end to say hey like, you know You
know that were sponsored by these people I
[SPEAKER_00]: check these products out here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you got to do But it's like you
said when it's a constant like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you know, like every five fucking
seconds They're like making a plug about
[SPEAKER_00]: their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah, it's too much cuz like there,
you know, it is a lot of work for some For
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these people to do shit I'd
imagine but like I think that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: great about like what like Matt does in
the patreon It's like it's cool cuz like
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to buy like products or
nothing You can just support like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like five bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just Join it's you know,
five bucks ain't shit a month for in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion and it does filter out a lot of
people that are there just to start the
[SPEAKER_01]: drama and stuff, you know, so Well,
it's like a dream to get sponsored by like
[SPEAKER_01]: good products you actually use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's anything wrong with
that It's just like just don't be plugging
[SPEAKER_01]: me some shit that has nothing to do You
know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like or it's like a new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Like fertilizer is like it's such an
easy one or I'm just like Like god damn
[SPEAKER_01]: man, like most of these companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like yeah, I'm gonna grow some
fine weed with it But like when you do
[SPEAKER_01]: like get on something like some Kana,
you're just like dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes me look good It's fucking easy
to use and just like it's a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you know And it has been for a
long period of time, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're not sponsored by Kana,
but yo Kana
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if I think if you know people
don't want to talk about that kind of shit
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is very a lot of people We've
talked about this before people want to
[SPEAKER_00]: join a discord or a community just to talk
about weed They don't get plugged stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: every five minutes Yeah, but I do think
like if the if it makes sense and the
[SPEAKER_00]: person in charge is has their shit
together financially already it could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be pretty beneficial to The
community too because like yeah like like
[SPEAKER_00]: for example with like we do the grow-offs
the competitions and shit Like to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to put more prizes in shell like if you're
actually doing that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's awesome I think I think too,
you know, if you're actually creating real
[SPEAKER_00]: value for people and they're willing to do
some patreon stuff for you That's really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool But I also think like you were saying
if it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh if we're gonna talk about some plug-in
Mars Hydra I'll be rocking with you for
[SPEAKER_00]: five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Hook a brother up there No more
hydras got like the fucking Market
[SPEAKER_01]: cornered for like the more affordable shit
and then like all the way to AC infinity
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is like a little more bougie,
but they make good products to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's just like You know, it's just
like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's just it's especially if you're
new to all this you even just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to the companies Right,
you know, I think I wish there was more
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that being said since we'll
probably have some new people watching,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know guys gals I should say The
products aren't what it's gonna make your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the best it can be it can help in
certain Degrees like there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: variables to grow in fucking weed I mean,
I don't think you really ever have a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect run that being said a lot of the
guys including Myself and gals have used
[SPEAKER_00]: Equipment from and I do today in my garden
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I have products from all the
companies really and really now nowadays
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays is a great time for a new grower
because the products and the Competition
[SPEAKER_00]: is so fierce amongst these companies that
they're all pretty consistent You're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get pretty decent results from most of
them I would say I mean I go from using I
[SPEAKER_00]: use Mars Hydro and I use H&R H&L I use
Mars Hydro lights and I use H&L HLG lights
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think anyone's even any better?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that H&L G I've had better
runs more consistent H&L G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, see this is the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about smoking too much I do have
more consistent better runs with the HLG
[SPEAKER_00]: light but I have also had runs where the
runs in the Mars Hydro lights tents have
[SPEAKER_00]: came out better than the HLG so it's like
you know, that's a For a four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a two hundred and fifty dollar
light versus I think the Blackbird the one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the black is like seven I think it's
like seven on that seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're worth it It's just like if
you don't got the money, you don't got the
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh like But it was a game changer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was rocking some like old first gen LEDs
kind of shit I Switched to an HLG and was
[SPEAKER_01]: like immediately back where I needed to
be, you know, I just like oh, thank god It
[SPEAKER_01]: was just the fucking line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I sucked at this but I'm not
amazing You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh the cash profits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like I'm not like like bittersweet is
like to the T You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that man knows his shit and was good
at what he does Like I do not claim to be
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but at the same time for a hundred
bucks I could probably grow you like five
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of weed outside, you know,
and so it's just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah Yeah, yeah, that's being said I try
to do this on the intros, but any myself
[SPEAKER_00]: included anybody We have on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't claim to be expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't Dan and we're just speaking
from our own experience I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely graduated fucking third grade
Yeah, so all this shit Liz I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: best thing we can do is try to help new
growers by just speaking from our own
[SPEAKER_00]: experience And that being said it's not
about the equipment y'all I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as far as I'm not a light guy
bittersweet shout out You're the guy that
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said join the discord if you want
some real actual factual information But
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking from experience, I don't know if
LEDs have improved so dramatically over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last five years that like I mean I
still am literally to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at one right now I have a
fucking five-year-old Mars Hydro 100 Watt
[SPEAKER_00]: light running on my autos and it's working
just as good as the one I bought six
[SPEAKER_00]: months ago for the other little tent that
I have so like I think that's the main
[SPEAKER_01]: thing you want with LEDs is longevity
Yeah, you know does it do its job and does
[SPEAKER_01]: it stick around because a lot of They all
went out Well, you say that but nowadays
[SPEAKER_00]: that still happens so for example the ions
the four-foot ion of our lights I forget
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like 35 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I forget what the wattage is on
bittersweet put them on to me for my cone
[SPEAKER_00]: racks and my ceilings They had a recall or
I guess you call it a recall some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever malfunction I got went to the
Hydro store and I guess a big bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: them were basically coming out like
Fucking purple light and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have they gave me a Mine wouldn't
even do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I first one space loses They gave me a
free light that preset so I took it But
[SPEAKER_00]: that being said You know, I do use
products from everybody and like you were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that the longevity For me that
think that's why I do fuck with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe a cheaper product You know like
say Mars Hydro because I have had lights
[SPEAKER_00]: for five years that have you know a
hundred watt light bro Come on and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like the skate dog the best one of the
best plants ever had was the skank dog and
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking started flowering that
motherfucker Under that same little
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's in the guys in the
discord will sell Tom H&L says some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed he grows is the ones that are in
the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like So, I don't know if that
means anything but bro science basically
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like basically I have one HLG over
like a four by eight space and I put it up
[SPEAKER_01]: a little higher Because like I have a
bunch of plants right now that need not be
[SPEAKER_01]: in that direct light, especially not when
they're Finishing it's like it went from I
[SPEAKER_01]: was looking at pics and it was like two
weeks ago I had like dark like nice green
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and within two weeks flat of being
just like a little too light stress I
[SPEAKER_01]: probably I think I went a little too heavy
on the calcium and lost some shit up
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitter got me back on track with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just like You know,
it's little things like that where you
[SPEAKER_01]: just live and learn with your plants,
you know Am hazes and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say the AMS when they're
finishing They don't want that direct
[SPEAKER_01]: light and the AM haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they want it ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't They want low and slow for like
14 weeks Bunch I noticed that I've said
[SPEAKER_00]: this before in the last episode or the one
before that when I grew the AMS Matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: fact under that same 100 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there about you know this tall
and bro Yeah, the ones directly under the
[SPEAKER_00]: light They just didn't fucking like it and
it blew my mind because growing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know You hear about these hazes or
these equatorial fucking varieties and you
[SPEAKER_00]: think like Surely they're like they like
light bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like come on They're like my past bro,
they get some Yeah, yeah, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so You gotta be you gotta stay
flexible with that kind of thing or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you see something happening with
your plants that they don't like usually
[SPEAKER_01]: Adding something is not the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's where people always go It's
like well what am I what am I deficient in
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm like, well, you're probably gave
an excess of something that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Locked up what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you need to like Get rid of some of
that somehow or like rebalance your
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios, you know It's not really that
something's missing or you needed to do
[SPEAKER_01]: him your fucking light Because everyone
wants to like crank their LEDs all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: up But with like the HLG even like for a
while like up above the the canopy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know more than a foot They finish a
lot closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have all ceilings, but they I
don't think I think I started like 30% and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I only get up to 70% Anything past
that and I'm cooking even you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the the P haze in the beginning loved
the light You know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it started cooking them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just Monday to bro I don't care at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a par value is and what the DLI is
Well, you know the Mars hydro 450 it even
[SPEAKER_00]: burnt the P haze on like fucking 60% bro,
like yeah, I didn't know that's what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing at the time Until you said
something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was just like love nutrients,
bro Cuz like I I had went out of town and
[SPEAKER_00]: she re up on it and I wanted her to put
them into bigger pots But they put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: two pots and they were in like a gallon
basically So it didn't they and at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time I wasn't really leaning into bottles
I was doing mainly just leaning into my
[SPEAKER_00]: media or my soil and stuff and my My I
wasn't really in dry amendments a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit here there and like in flower
basically in Flower I would lean into
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah this run I've been so proud of
myself dude and happy with and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: plugging canna because you could get way
cheaper nutrients canna is not the Best
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient line in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just easy to use basically for me and
Yeah, it's great results dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I went from happy, you know
starting to have trouble with a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: an ocean Fox farm like, you know Three
four weeks in if I didn't start doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same as it used to be Bro, I'm talking I
got plants in little fucking cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them in solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them in point five gallon Half
gallons, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I gotta pull some shit next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be ready cuz Matt Let me show plants
last episode nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time I'll be ready, but I got a
little I like it just have like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: changed a whole way of looking and growing
and I think this is important for New
[SPEAKER_00]: people watching to never really get set in
their ways because you might think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing the best and I didn't really think
that because I think here's always room
[SPEAKER_00]: for improvement Especially when you hang
around with the caliber of guys that we
[SPEAKER_00]: hang around and girls With the experience
and the knowledge and stuff that rubs off
[SPEAKER_00]: on you But yeah, dude, like this run is
probably gonna be my best run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went around and every fucking light I
own I went and looked up the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got every because for years,
bro I kind of just there's been times
[SPEAKER_00]: where I've like Ramped up my inputs into
my grows, of course, like trying new shit
[SPEAKER_00]: or like really stay on top of them pH and
all the stuff I've always stayed on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: pH and but like never really measuring
nutrients and things like that I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on visuals and or like preventative
things in trying to be ahead of it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit but And especially when you
work in the same environment for four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five years You kind of understand your you
know, your water is coming out the same pH
[SPEAKER_00]: just about every time So like you get set
into these rhythms And you're growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same plants the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of becomes easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Yeah, man, this can of shit has really
stepped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed the way I've grown So now
I've been going keeping shit in solo cups
[SPEAKER_00]: or fucking point five gallons I like the
point five because a little bit bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: root ball to start with and then I just
straight up I've been using those AC you
[SPEAKER_00]: said you don't care for much because you
had to do hundreds of them at a time But
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using those fucking AC fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like a like a Fabric bag
with a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots can and bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them, bro Set them right down into
the fucking three or three I've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: three three gallons, but I said I'm right
down in the three gallon and Dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: I give them a week or so just chilling and
yeah, man And then I flip bro and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not show you shit It's giving me
better plants like I used to up pot like a
[SPEAKER_00]: at least once sometimes twice And it's
giving me bigger play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean this game don't bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kid you not I'm gonna show some
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting dog is fucking huge,
bro It's that local tech man, but fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: six-foot plant in a one gallon pot because
watered three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I I actually got some one gallons to
bro and they're fucking bigger than Plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used to grow in three gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just threw some new plants in the
perpetual That's like a pino hunt of
[SPEAKER_01]: clones that I took off some little seed
moths that I keep And when I do stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that I literally like pot it into the one
gallon directly and I just send it just
[SPEAKER_01]: put it right into the perpetual and then
you'll end up with like a little plant
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, you know, like yeah 18 inches
or two feet tall and Sometimes you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: blown away because like you can do that
still end up with a four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: Right Yeah, it's that's one thing I've
learned that's helped me a lot is like
[SPEAKER_01]: keep your shit like the whole dry bag
thing, I think I've kind of come to the
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusion that it's like well you need it
to a certain extent but actually like if
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at like a Like a moisture content
and EC in the soil when you have full dry
[SPEAKER_01]: bags You're doing this huge wave of just
like super high and see when it's dry
[SPEAKER_01]: Super low moisture or in the oh,
it's just it's one of its you're just like
[SPEAKER_01]: edging towards disease and
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything pretty moist all the time like
not like water log super But it's changed
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew some fine I had like one issue Like
two weeks ago Like what prompted it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a late water hold super late I go
down and the plants are starting to have
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit and ever since then
that's when all the problems So it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't I don't edge like that with
dry bags anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like I want consistent moisture
With as minimal variation at the optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: point always yeah, and that's what
commercial growers do now, too That's why
[SPEAKER_01]: they water every 45 minutes for a few
seconds or whatever It's like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to keep it in this band of optimal
not like too wet too dry too wet too dry
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with cocoa like when you see
the media change color to that dry lighter
[SPEAKER_01]: brown like you already fucked up Well,
you know like you don't need to dry back
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got built-in ferocity, you know see
what I've noticed with I think it depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on like what you're growing and I I
noticed with the Ocean bro, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watering like I know obviously you're
doing way less if you're doing when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it more often But bro, I noticed I
see it right now because I got I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three Our Pro mix Pro mix with my
brother really low Obviously not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: food in there and then the other half are
in the ocean and dude ocean I will say
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be very fucking careful,
especially with like triangle cushions and
[SPEAKER_00]: like this certain I Guess oh gee leaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know bitter talked about this
before and he could speak on it better But
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed if in the ocean yeah,
bro, like I guess worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's the ocean itself It's
not that it's a bad product or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just it's very easy to overwater I
noticed in it and I noticed like when I
[SPEAKER_00]: have the Pro mix where it's so fucking I
mean that shit you can't even hardly
[SPEAKER_01]: overwater that it's really hard Oh,
yeah with the amount of pearl white in it
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's pretty hard to overwater like
you can't do it because like with deep
[SPEAKER_01]: moss It just keeps expanding the sponge
just gets bigger and more full of water
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like cocoa just gets to a certain
point and then drops it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah flows through, you know, and so
that's why I point beginners towards Coco,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though in some ways it can be a
little more difficult or like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know just knowledge intensive to do it
Right, but like you're at least not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck up your like with overwatering which
I feel like is like the new guy mistake
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're just trying to pump up,
you know, yeah, they're not ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, I think I think you you got to
be definitely careful for sure Are you
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some ocean but coke cocoa can have
its own challenges too though as well I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's been since we're kind of
talking About people new growers there
[SPEAKER_00]: might be some people out there that don't
even know what the definite or maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: the definition But what drop drive backs
even mean could you explain that maybe for
[SPEAKER_00]: like new people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so like the normal idea I guess is
like you've got your pot of media cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know let's not talk include hydro at
all it's like cocoa or potting soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: When you first water it it's kind of like
hit this point of like saturation you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I mean and like that for a little
while is fine, but if you What's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: is like that water is filling the the pore
spaces between all the little fragments of
[SPEAKER_01]: the And the peat moss itself expands and
so you need air Space in the soil for that
[SPEAKER_01]: root to basically breathe and do its own
gas exchange and so When you first water
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you over water you filled all that
air space up and it's gone and so you Can
[SPEAKER_01]: just suffocate the roots so drying back is
like the dry back from saturated to bone
[SPEAKER_01]: dry like zero saturation of moisture You
know and so there's an optimum point in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle somewhere depending on what
you're using and the pot size and I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure what the Unit would be in that you
know, but uh There is an optimum point
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have the right amount of
moisture for the root the right amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: air space for air exchange and then also
like, you know, like the fertilizer inside
[SPEAKER_00]: that it needs to That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of terms that
We use on the main show with Matt or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that our little headache for
people I mean we got new people that join
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord and we'll ask some newer
questions so I think it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: important to to kind of you know,
I know Matt doesn't care to do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow content but or you know teaching
people but I think it's kind of important
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know if we want people to grow
better weed and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you do have to kind of splice that in
a little bit and I think a Quick little
[SPEAKER_00]: tip for people out there that are our new
growers and you're and you are having
[SPEAKER_00]: problems Over water and just just lift
your pots up guys You know the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: you fucking water them in feel how heavy
that is weigh it And then weigh it again
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's completely dry Calculate the
difference for you if you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get fucking too crazy just fill it I mean
just fill it and I mean It's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: simple, but it is it is challenging
because as it is one of the bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: problems I feel like you know,
we're just I still over water sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: myself just cuz You know if I have to go
somewhere and I'm not gonna be around for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit Of course, you know,
I'm gonna go ahead and get them watered
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a fucking irrigation system
I'm not doing hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said my the way I have my shit is
real simple real low inputs I like to kiss
[SPEAKER_00]: method, you know, people say that all the
time just keep it simple I still hand
[SPEAKER_00]: water a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently did get some of those Wicking
trays I might try some of that shit out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah Yeah, yeah, they're pretty cool
and they do work it's just my gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: right now are so mobile like I'm moving
shit around I did do a little siege up not
[SPEAKER_00]: too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the particular garden I wanted to use
their area I wanted to utilize them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent specifically that was like the right
size for everything I got a bunch of autos
[SPEAKER_00]: in there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just not set up for it but yeah,
dude, um Maybe to kind of jump back on
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of getting I don't know how long
we've been running for but kind of let's
[SPEAKER_00]: let's kind of get back to where the the
discord I guess you At some point you join
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you join it right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you fucking kind of just watch the
loves a little bit or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah I just watched the lives for like
and listen to the show for like Maybe like
[SPEAKER_01]: the first two years it was going,
you know And then because I only I've only
[SPEAKER_01]: been on there for I think two years The
first year I was like pretty quiet and I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really talk to anyone and I had no
clue like the affiliation the friend
[SPEAKER_01]: groups and stuff and and then Once Matt
Brought me into the more inner circle then
[SPEAKER_01]: I started kind of like figuring out who's
who and like how's everyone Connected and
[SPEAKER_01]: like who's IRL friends and who's like
online only and shit like that But
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's been the best part of this
like The whole time I was growing weed I
[SPEAKER_01]: was into the nerdy shit, but I've never
been exposed to it IRL, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've never met another dude that was
into it in the same way or check For
[SPEAKER_01]: answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no peaches Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's dope to this point Being a
community of people that are like all into
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been similar way, you know Or it's
just like right now we're nerding out on
[SPEAKER_01]: like the specifics, you know Yeah,
and like history in general like you said
[SPEAKER_01]: it on one of the previous episodes looks
like it's a pretty niche like content You
[SPEAKER_01]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so but there is like a market for it
and there's people that are curious and so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to share my knowledge and the
things that I've experienced and learn
[SPEAKER_00]: through this whole journey with it That's
what I'm glad to have you on and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: Able to talk about some of the your
experience out and Callie and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more modern shit because I do know there
are a lot of the younger People out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that that might watch that you don't think
that we only grow hazes and shit We do
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck with other shit like our disco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We you know, we got a bunch of older dudes
So, you know, they're gonna they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: joke on us a little bit when we're popping
the auto flowers and stuff But I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's part of the that's part of how you
know communities used to be bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it reminds me of hanging out like An
auto mechanic shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just give each other shit all day and
it's kind of the best filtering system for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that probably shouldn't be around
because if you get if you get But hurt by
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you get but hurt really
fucking easy, bro I don't know if maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: our discord is the best place for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you'd like to have Fun and you can
take a take some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know It you know, it depends
on how you approach it to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I came into the discord making
memes About everybody pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, of course I'm gonna go
So I'll be honest I thought I was gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get banned within a month because I had
been banned from other Communities from
[SPEAKER_00]: just joking around like the way we joke
around every day and I just I thought I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be banned pretty quickly bro, but I want
to say that you guys have been just as
[SPEAKER_00]: pivotal in my growing success and really
have become becomes my Good friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, even though we all it's been awesome
with like you local D Rob Clark and a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple other people we've got to meet up
in real life So it's it's awesome to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys in person and you are the guys
that I thought you were going to be And me
[SPEAKER_00]: and you in particular, like I said at the
beginning we got to hang out for it I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to hang out a weekend,
but we got to spend eight hours in pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty weather pretty shitty But on a boat
it was some random other dude and we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: great time That dude thought we were so
fucking weird We probably are bro,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he was saying he was saying our
fucking catchphrases and shit by the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of that day He was like one of the boys by
the end of it I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was chain-smoking all that weed that
they hate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're I can't keep up with you I
I'm very much like I take a bong rep or
[SPEAKER_01]: two and then I go chill for an hour or two
You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, then I double back but like these
guys man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit That's like smoking for once
while rolling up another few and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's rolling And so it's just like
do those joints just kept coming and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: saw a picture of me at the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like Why I'm sleepy dance We
them boys Michigan baby No, I always like
[SPEAKER_00]: to highlight Michigan I like to highlight
Kentucky because you know, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to represent the places
you're from and share love to those people
[SPEAKER_00]: because where I come from bro most people
not to make it sound like it a trap but
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really make it out from there
and some of them don't want to and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: blame them but I always will represent
Kentucky and Michigan to you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we joke on Michigan all the time in the
discord, but I love y'all and Everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran into up here has been really nice
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, it's been cool, bro It's it's
it's so wild going from a place where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like it's extremely illegal to fuck
with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's medical in Kentucky now But at
the time when I lived there wasn't and to
[SPEAKER_00]: go from there to Michigan where
motherfuckers are high There's growth
[SPEAKER_00]: stores on every corner, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a different it's so chill,
bro And you know black when I was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: black market shit, bro I'd be like this
sucks because the weeds fucking cheap as
[SPEAKER_00]: hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ain't making nothing, you know,
but for me Just be able to grow in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: not worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great, dude You know,
hey, I wonder out of the black market as
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been first like I sleep so good Me
too, bro Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not tripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not waking up in the middle of the
night to sounds in the alley Just like
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck grab my gun Yeah,
right So we're stressing about the IRS and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit and just like all that nonsense Like
you forget how desensitize or you like
[SPEAKER_01]: realize how desensitized you were to all
of it Yeah, I mean I started listening out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fucking rap music just to cope I
feel like just to get To get me amped up
[SPEAKER_00]: to get I'm about you know Get out there
and do what you got to do or whatever But
[SPEAKER_00]: and see for me for me when Kentucky was
kind of fun that cat-and-mouse shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it It turns you into like I'm not
an adrenaline junkie like I don't drive
[SPEAKER_01]: fast cars and fuck and if I'm on a fucking
dirt bike, I'm just Like that slow burn
[SPEAKER_01]: adrenaline where it's just like cortisol
just like that buildup, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that just like impending doom,
but it hasn't popped off yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like I like living a normal
life now and just like working is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking carpenter and shit like It's
fucking boring The only reason I can do
[SPEAKER_01]: carpentry is that it's like your mind is
occupied Because it does take like I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't been doing it for so long that
it's like second nature to I have to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned a new shit all day all the
time and so it's like Like it keeps my
[SPEAKER_01]: mind like still because I'm having to
focus Yeah, but I need that because if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not focused on and I'm just like in my
mind about shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Yeah, normal life can be like really
monotonous and boring You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I teeter back and forth sometimes I miss
that lifestyle, but at the same time I did
[SPEAKER_00]: it for so long I kind of look back to
though and it is like a waste like I it
[SPEAKER_00]: provided an income in a way of living but
like I did I kind of like got wrapped up
[SPEAKER_00]: in that lifestyle feel like a little too
hard and didn't really it gave me the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability for a long time to check out of
reality and live in my own little bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: and In the moment, it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like People not like nephews and shit
grew up around me and like I didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to cover I didn't want to come around
doing the shit I was doing because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of shit I was doing was not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't bad, but it was Not shit that I
wanted to get my family and my Friends
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed up in I mean to this day I mean my a
lot of my friends and family didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: knew knew what I had done You know,
they all thought I had a normalized job
[SPEAKER_00]: for all these years So I'm playing out
like I got a job to these people and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're asking, you know How's your job
going to like that and great mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm you know, she's thinking I
got a job Meanwhile, I'm trapping out of
[SPEAKER_00]: her house, you know, but any doing dumb
shit, but the pitfalls for me was that I
[SPEAKER_01]: got into this at a time where like you
didn't really need to hide anymore,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like I'd like all these older guys
They like had a full career while doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this and when it kind of made it to the
point where it didn't make financial sense
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they didn't really want to do that side
of it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had that career to go to so now I'm
like fucking in my 30s Like starting a new
[SPEAKER_01]: career like that shit sucks, dude It's
like good since like skills I always
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted, you know, I mean I was a shitty
boy Builder, but I made shit happen before
[SPEAKER_01]: this and it's like now I can like make
real shit, you know like a little over
[SPEAKER_01]: like a year in it's just like I finally
get my head on my shoulders as far as like
[SPEAKER_01]: how shit works, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's just like oh I need to go
build myself a fucking like I'm gonna go
[SPEAKER_01]: this weekend and build my dad a pump house
on his phone And it's like not gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: that hard at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna take a few hours, but it's just
like it's easy work man Like it's not it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not that complicated or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to know the steps Yeah,
I mean dude, I've got pitched myself
[SPEAKER_00]: because it sounds corny, but I say it's
all time But I'm living my dream right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my money I get my money and then I
I'm able to do what I do like this the
[SPEAKER_00]: show We're a weed and I'm able to do that,
you know, you know Would it be cool to
[SPEAKER_00]: make money off a weed again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, it'd be great but but but you know
being able to do this is is my dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, and I can make no money from this
ever And still this is what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean her talking about about this shit
all time Like I remember bro watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: horror ace of bontis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about his girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember watching those videos Wishing I
had a buddy bro just to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, man like check these plants out
so like for me like being able to Be up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan and grow weed and not feel like
I'm gonna get in trouble doing it I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been probably the best experience for
me ever broke because it makes me feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I got a purpose and it's not like
this thing a shady thing that I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm can't really be too proud of to
everybody Where's like now when my family
[SPEAKER_00]: calls and they're like, you know,
what the fuck you up to or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm like just up here growing
weed I like growing weed again,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was kind of a time like after
my Career like fizzled out with it that is
[SPEAKER_01]: just like I didn't really like growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a job sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah now I'm back on the other side of
that it took a few grows back home to like
[SPEAKER_01]: even Like it here again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought this is hard man and ward
sucks, you know I had people for all that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit now I could just like make the recipe
and fucking send it and keep tabs and More
[SPEAKER_01]: general oversight of things Yeah,
but now it's like when it's all on you
[SPEAKER_01]: again, it's like well I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's peaceful petting clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unless you got to do like,
you know a couple hundred but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but uh, even that man I like
I've missed that like I miss like cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: bolt clones like that shit was fun to me I
always loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my favorite part It's like if I
could just run a weed nursery and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy nice moms of the whole variety of
shit Sell them to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah One of my favorite things to do is
sort seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like to chuck a lot That's
such a I think I got like a mint like
[SPEAKER_00]: something ADHD or something take now I
smoke a lot of the seeded but that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times because I'm dust and so
like I don't know like what is cooler than
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to crack open some weed from
one of the guys gear like a pack that was
[SPEAKER_00]: dank that I chucked some pollen from
another dude's pack that was dank and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, like I'm not a I'm not a breeder
like I don't know what I'm really doing
[SPEAKER_00]: really I mean, I'm just I'm just having
fun and chucking so You know keep being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to keep the cut Of a plant of that
run that I liked and then also have some
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking process of it too that are already
done Like dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's something else you also like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I just hit the tee I hit the
tee haze with the am haze and I'm super
[SPEAKER_01]: stoked on it I got to do the whole thing
again and find another am haze balance I
[SPEAKER_01]: find I think I might have picked the wrong
receiver for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but Now that I'm kind of but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really gonna even think about that
till I smoke them I just kind of picked
[SPEAKER_01]: one that I like though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like fucking throw it on there man,
you know, but now I'm gonna have my own
[SPEAKER_01]: little You know like haze line for
personal head stash and shit like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I Took the resurrection This is
the mobile one version not the Kim di-95
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the resurrection times them mobile
one and I took some pollen from I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just the one I think I just had one
male from I've done a bunch of them so
[SPEAKER_00]: far, but anyways took a male some pollen
from that one and then I hit all those
[SPEAKER_00]: peahases that I Grew yeah with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get up telling the scene cuz I
just did a real light dust and I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: the lowers I probably got I probably got
like maybe a hundred seeds but for me like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more than enough That's that's more
than enough for me and a little decent
[SPEAKER_00]: little 20 pop or a little 10 here take it
there but uh, yeah, you know that being
[SPEAKER_00]: said though You know, is there anything
that you've grown out from the guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: excluding some of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already talked about that's really
stood out for you Yeah, the fucking ED
[SPEAKER_01]: Appy for a Chanel is probably some of my
favorite weed I've discovered Like like
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dream was my first one and there's
another one blue cheese that I really like
[SPEAKER_01]: too But they're kind of in the same vein,
you know, I mean one of the cheese is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little Stonier and the blue dream is like
good little looks like gamer weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like you feel it But like
you're still there and like fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: pumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But the ED Appy dude, like I can
smoke that shit all day every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it so much I haven't found I have
one that I like but I'm looking for that
[SPEAKER_01]: pino just like local, you know,
cuz that that pino one was just like Round
[SPEAKER_01]: it like a green crack like throwback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is what H&L called it,
but it's just like it was a special plant
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so really was and it was just heady
as fuck too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a great high to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super tasty It was gorgeous bud,
and I haven't seen anything like it come
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the ED Appy Drive Grown so far and
so That's the dog shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah dogs should have people call it
dog shit But uh that that that one you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about locals particular that one
in particular That one was one of the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: I was packing I think I brought that one
with us on the boat that day that thing
[SPEAKER_01]: was nice Yeah, I think we had some I got a
jar from him and like it was like one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the first things gone I was like that and
the band-aid were just fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a jar of P Hayes from him or a sweet
pea sweet pea Sorry, I got a jar of sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: being from him, bro And I I savored that
thing for probably two weeks, but I burned
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking every the guys all the time I
see I'm talking about It's not morning
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fuck that bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking that shit all day,

[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it Wakes up at like 4 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: And starts with that shit I want to I want
to smoke have a smokeathon with these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz I think he's he's probably gonna be
the only one in it that I can That it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably gonna dust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I could dust the rest of y'all
miss you, baby Like like love told me
[SPEAKER_01]: about like a drive they went on one time
and just like
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny I got a buddy back
home that reminds me a lot of you and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I called you sleepy Dan because
Soon as I met you bro something about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at you I was like that
motherfucker there as soon as he takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: few joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to sleep Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah when we were on that trip like I Just
got enough like a big roof framing job and
[SPEAKER_01]: like had been just like going hard I was
so fucking exhausted when we started that
[SPEAKER_01]: trip and then we went for like three days
on two hours sleep each night Like fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so tired already and then that much
weed smoking too Like I kept having to go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the band-aid just like perk me up
a little bit like cut through it Just be
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm alive Yeah, yeah, it's like
listen in any way like when you're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: room with like Fucking H&L and Rob Clark
just like going off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't have anything to add to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to absorb, you know I was
gonna ask you being that you run that
[SPEAKER_00]: person for one of the few people that
showed up there to meet Rob Clark if there
[SPEAKER_00]: was anything you took away from it or Or
just your experience meeting him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like was he what you thought he was gonna
be or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really have like a lot of
preconceived notions because like I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: deep into the forum stuff, you know,
like yeah That's that that trip is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually what prompted me to go back and
start reading all those old forum threads
[SPEAKER_01]: like with Neville and like just like
looking up old strains and like learning
[SPEAKER_01]: more about it and stuff And so that's been
like a later part of my journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But yeah, it's got me way into that
stuff now And so like now like when I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked early Pearl from from Buck like I
wrote Rob an email I'm still waiting here
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's in Laos right now But uh
Yeah, cuz he apparently bred it
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so like I dug up up as much as I
could on that story and then like go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the source and see what else you can find
You know, cuz there's still you can read
[SPEAKER_01]: all those threads and there's still a lot
of unanswered questions, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know like Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was gonna say before I forget Madjag
invited me to come down here and hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: with all him and those them old head dudes
down there and I think I'm gonna get I
[SPEAKER_00]: might try to go bro, cuz I was like I Told
Matt as I do wouldn't be dope if we all we
[SPEAKER_00]: got to go down there and do like a live
interview with Madjag and something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was so cool Yeah, yeah, and people if
people don't know who Madjag is Cuz you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when we do these podcasts I need I
need to make sure that I'm kind of giving
[SPEAKER_00]: people some idea what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Madjag Madjag's this old school dude
from he grew a lot of shit Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and other I guess sativa
varieties and things like that In Magic
[SPEAKER_00]: Canyon, I think in Arizona, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to know anything about him,
he's cool, dude He's got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes with Matt on this channel Go just
type in Madjag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did one with him recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt actually has some of his Some of his
gear actually some supposed older stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know some labels and some other
stuff on the website on Matt's website
[SPEAKER_00]: over at right sees comm if you want to
check out that she go look it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but uh Going to see him would be a bucket
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking cool, bro And you
know, I have to say like it's so humbling
[SPEAKER_00]: for me because you know kind of like you
were saying with Rob Like I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: shit bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I really don't like I know how to
grow weed I know how to get it how and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke You know the bare minimum of a shit,
you know, I I'm not a knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a book person like I don't claim
to know a lot of shit, but It's really
[SPEAKER_00]: just humble and just hanging out with
these guys And yeah, and like you said I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt kind of like a dummy actually because
I was you know to me I was hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm going to see this guy that
almost nobody's really got to meet other
[SPEAKER_00]: than his his people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: and so to be able to go and talk to him
about weed especially and I was like man
[SPEAKER_00]: like do I have Anything to bring to this
and I ultimately decided I don't so like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like you said there's listen to H and
let H and L do the talking and now looking
[SPEAKER_00]: back I regret not having some shit to ask
cuz it's I mean since then I've learned a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot and Yeah, and I feel like yeah just
doing the show with Matt's like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: made me realize like there's way more
bigger things and important shit I should
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be asking some of these guys
especially seeing the older dudes cuz You
[SPEAKER_00]: know people pass away and I hope they
don't or you know, obviously not to take
[SPEAKER_00]: this bad tone or nothing, but Everybody
gets old and everybody's time come so
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just now to be going from Kentucky
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This extreme has been such a fucking rod
for me That's why I don't let it get past
[SPEAKER_00]: me every day that I'm so thankful I don't
put any of these guys up on a pedestal cuz
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day I'm gonna always do
my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what I'll be me but but getting
the opportunity and Getting the chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out with you guys and use you and
especially like H and L Matt earn I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: all the guys Sean everybody to get in the
talk to him and You know and just being a
[SPEAKER_00]: sponge and going from a dude hustling in
like, Kentucky to like Being in Michigan
[SPEAKER_00]: being hang out with you guys and and shit
and it's it's never lost on me,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro I fucking like I said, uh,
it sounds nerdy cuz I know some of you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys out there have been in Black market
shit and probably still are to this day or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the industry Commercially or
whatever and some people like you said You
[SPEAKER_00]: get burnt out on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bro, like I'm not I feel like I
haven't really peaked bro Cuz it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a kid in a candy store where I
went years without talking to nobody about
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit and now I'm like able to hang out
these guys like H&L and bitter and Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, you know like any of those or
dislike them or whatever like the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that those guys have Yeah,
just on that level of learning how to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: better grower and I don't know bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I tell her all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I feel the same way then it's
like I haven't peaked in any real way
[SPEAKER_01]: because like I didn't know any of this You
know, I mean, I'm still like in that just
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb everything you can and it's like
all the circles I came up with were like
[SPEAKER_01]: cash crop dudes like yeah I thought all my
questions and ideas were fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how you make money,
you know, so it's just like I've never met
[SPEAKER_01]: people like this Until I joined this
group, you know, yeah, so it's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: like changed Like I say before it got me
back in the weed before I was just like I
[SPEAKER_01]: just want some good shit That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's just like I'm back into
making stuff and like trying new things
[SPEAKER_01]: again Everything I thought I knew was like
not it's like yeah, maybe it works or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever You know, but or a lot of the
shit I thought I knew about like history
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff was just like wrong It's like
one of those classic bullshit stories that
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt's always Like dispelling for people
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah Yeah, yeah for anybody watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a history guy myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know a lot about that kind
of shit So if you are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: something heady a little bit more in-depth
than the breeding or history Matt does
[SPEAKER_00]: have the main show every Friday at 9 p.m
Eastern time and you can check that out
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly like I've told you before in the
Gaza This is basically just to chill and
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and talk about we with my friends And
people I know and like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told the other guests on if if if you
want to come back on Down the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be fucking great, dude You know as
far as moving, you know in the future do
[SPEAKER_00]: you got you just you have anything that
you're working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've done your reversal spray
that you've been working on you said you
[SPEAKER_00]: are messing with some season shit So
what's what's in the future for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you got anything going on or what's
your next set of goals that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: share?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd love to get something Like like
I was talking I forget who was talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: this about but it's just I think it was
stony Where I was just like dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've never had the opportunity to
like revive something old, you know I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be like a dream come through is
like have some old like early 2000s packs
[SPEAKER_01]: of something, you know, I'm like trying
this like Bring some sort of like bring it
[SPEAKER_01]: back onto the scene in some way like some
of these guys That would be a dream,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think I'm also just like not old
enough And I wasn't in the scene at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to like have been there to buy the
seed But I don't know the older guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: are like getting rid of their collections
and stuff and so for me I'm just like
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for new cool plants and then doing
little breeding projects hoping I stumble
[SPEAKER_01]: across something worth like Working with
and like recollecting clones to like do a
[SPEAKER_01]: line with you know, but yeah kind of just
exploring right now I need to work on the
[SPEAKER_01]: spray more but it's just like we're about
to enter like my busy Season again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have been doing it all winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like I'm kind of space
constraints like I have power restrictions
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm getting ready to like Fix up a
little bit and then I got to build myself
[SPEAKER_01]: like a little breeding chamber Or I can
just like have two plants kind of thing or
[SPEAKER_01]: like flower out of mail and then like
collect it and dust it So it's like right
[SPEAKER_01]: now I'm playing a little fast and loose
and like I don't like it But you leave a
[SPEAKER_01]: male a day too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like sudden later like who's your
fucking daddy again like Any one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess and so yeah, man just like popping
a lot of stuff from H&L unpacked and Some
[SPEAKER_01]: of my old stuff that I haven't grown in a
while seeing what's in there and then some
[SPEAKER_01]: newsy stuff, but I Don't know what will
come of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of just happy that I enjoy doing
it But if I could ever fund a vacation I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to do it any we should that'd be
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah You know, I do cheap as vacations to
the bar is set low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man You know, the big the biggest
thing about growing weed is you do have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sacrifices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean not even from a you know in terms
of black market II type things but even
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you know legal place growing
weed You sacrifice time with your loved
[SPEAKER_00]: ones and you sacrifice Space in your home
for maybe other shit and you can't it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard to get away and go on vacation
so you are very Glued to your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know for the most part especially if
you're running any kind of numbers or
[SPEAKER_00]: doing any kind of real projects And if
you're running one gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah Yeah, if you're fucking yeah running
cocoa and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or you know, and you can work around
that shit I know people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: compositions are gonna be that you know,
you gotta get hooked up doing it this way
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit, but I'm not Trying to flood my
fucking house, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've uh, I've done the fish tank shit
before I had a bunch of fish tanks I've
[SPEAKER_00]: flooded my house so many goddamn times,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking good I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flood a house real quick with
miter tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we got a we got old wood floors
and shit, bro It would just be a disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the basement with that shit It's
just like it just flows right down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: My net my next spot we're talking we're
fixing to move Uh, which is fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: another dream like I tell you all the time
like I might be moving pretty close to H
[SPEAKER_00]: &L, dude So oh for real And earn so I
think I might literally be 10 minutes away
[SPEAKER_00]: from earn, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh for real That's my dream too is the
head out that way I've been I talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: it a bit with H&L I was just like dude if
I didn't have like a family and like
[SPEAKER_01]: elderly parents kind of like tying me down
to California like I would Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would visit twice a year, you know,
yeah and like not look back It's like we
[SPEAKER_01]: said a few times so much fucking money to
live here And you're like we're on like my
[SPEAKER_01]: wife's in these homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one fucking income It's just
like and a lot of other places that's fine
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can do it, you know But it's just
like here man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's struggle bus when you're on
that solo income I wonder how much the
[SPEAKER_00]: price of living and has attributed to The
decline of that industry as well to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain degree because I mean like,
you know Say you live in a Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the laws are not in your favor
But you know rent for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-covid was you could get a
three-bedroom brick house A big basement a
[SPEAKER_00]: little building out back 550 bucks a
month, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh You know I'm saying now you're looking
about seven seven fifteen somewhere some
[SPEAKER_00]: During the city a thousand bucks now,
I will say in the main city in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some Housing I got lights going
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a housing What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a conglomerate, but like an investment
group They're buying up a lot of rental
[SPEAKER_00]: property properties and increase It's
increasing the value because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying every other house in communities
and shit like that But yeah, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wonder how much that attributed
to a lot of it because you know If your
[SPEAKER_00]: rent was I know like the price of living
them the price or in the way how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: make there's like a Difference there,
but yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wondered it's only for certain
things It's like if you're a nurse you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making bank out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making bank Yeah, if you have one
of those like really professional type
[SPEAKER_01]: careers you're making bank But it's just
like if you're just like a residential
[SPEAKER_01]: carpenter like same kind of money in a lot
of states Then I mean and like if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer you can make the same kind of money
in other states It's like I just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have like I have like an old man skill set
you know I think it's like I know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: like farm and grow food dope and shit and
now I'm learning how to build shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but um Unless you like own a
business or you go union like it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: like that amazing pay for how much it
costs away Then it's like I think average
[SPEAKER_01]: rent in my area is up to like 2,500 bucks
a month For like a really simple like two
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom one bath old Shitty house not like
a dumps but like not like Piffin by any
[SPEAKER_01]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so But it's like that a lot of
places even in like Oklahoma like rents
[SPEAKER_01]: were fucking skyrocketing when I was like
just as almost as expensive as I'm here I
[SPEAKER_01]: was just like the fuck Hey, you wouldn't
believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my house payment is fucking 1700
bucks Yeah, throw another fucking thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: on you got mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my 900 square foot little 100 year
old house Yeah, we got a nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we're sitting on five acres It
ain't that great, but the we are out out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the woods But you get better pricing
down in Kentucky, but you're living out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of nowhere, bro I mean,
you know, you're if you like Pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable spot overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you know, it's like me and her
talk about this all the time No matter
[SPEAKER_00]: where you go in life, there's gonna be
pros and cons about living there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whether you know, you're gonna
If you live in Kentucky, you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to get sushi, you know If you live
in Cali your rent's gonna be three grand a
[SPEAKER_00]: month for a two bedroom house,
I don't know but But yeah, man We're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting to a closing point man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you want to fucking plug
or talk about before we get out of here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one thing that's been pissing me off
a lot lately is all these like crunchy ass
[SPEAKER_01]: organic people where they're like I only
shop at Whole Foods you try and like like
[SPEAKER_01]: the finer points of organics are just like
lost on so many people and like fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: choice when it comes to organics is like
the last thing that I'm really concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: about like I feel like the whole thing is
the lack of use of pesticides and Like
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical pesticides, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a lot of organic These are just
like I don't spray but like if you had
[SPEAKER_01]: like a farm that like used You know
synthetic fertilizer like man-made
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer and then don't spray anything
People are lashes poison your weeds poison
[SPEAKER_01]: your food poison and I'm just like fuck
You don't even know anything about this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit all the fungi in the bacteria make it
into this exact fertilizer in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just we found a more efficient way
that feeds the whole fucking earth and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just rich people You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like That shit just it keeps coming
up in my life recently and I'm just like
[SPEAKER_01]: the fertilizers is like the last thing
like do you think the river tears if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like a thousand pounds of nitrogen
flowing into it whether it's from manure
[SPEAKER_01]: or from fucking A factor like it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a thousand pounds of ice
creates in the fucking water, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so Stuff like that just drives me
fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just wanted to you know,
hey fuck off with that shit bottle boy No,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean it's just something I've
thought about a lot and it's in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know you're not but at the end of
the day like if someone wants to fuck in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Shit in buckets and and grow
their wheat now if somebody if somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: really if that's the way people like to
grow them Fuck you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I like I said earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning maybe maybe there I
think You know, if you are a new grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think organics is probably you know And
there's gonna be a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: disagree with this opinion, but I think
organics is more one of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging probably styles of growing to
approach indoors if you don't have never
[SPEAKER_00]: grown before now, you know ideally if it
was a perfect world and you can make it
[SPEAKER_00]: work and you know all the shit and you
knew what you're doing maybe but like I
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't I just can't get behind that
when I see You know what people can do
[SPEAKER_00]: with some bottles and just you know a
little bit of nothing bro because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the organic growers guys and I
would say a lot of bottle boys myself
[SPEAKER_00]: included don't really know what's going on
in that fucking pot, dude And they act
[SPEAKER_00]: like they do they act like they do bro But
the reality of it is this is a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, bro You could probably shit on the
motherfuckers and they'll grow like I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know like not you know, I mean like
they're They'll grow on pretty easily
[SPEAKER_00]: under a lot of different conditions But
uh, you know that being said not to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little hater but when I start seeing a
bunch of organics guys buds bigger than my
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flower buds that grow with little
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might I might be inclined to start
believing it now that being said I have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen some nice organic grows out there
that crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's far Yeah, really well done
organic outdoors like some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke like I do it like when I grow
outdoors I go way heavier on like organic
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments than I do the bottles,
you know, it's just more cost-effective
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah suited to that side of style growing
but like indoors like you can chase your
[SPEAKER_01]: tail Endlessly trying to figure out what
you're doing wrong with organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I found out one time I was using
seabird guano and like seabird guano is
[SPEAKER_01]: dope But in hundred gallon smartpots not
in like three gallons in your indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: because the shit has a pH of like 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit You throw a tablespoon on your
fucking plant and suddenly your runoff is
[SPEAKER_01]: testing at like 90 You know, and it's just
like oh, that's a problem You know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you throw like one cup of it into
like a hundred or two hundred gallon smart
[SPEAKER_01]: pot It's just like it's just what the
plant wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, yeah But like that shit
has all its own problems, too You know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of organic derived fertilizers
are like mined by children in foreign
[SPEAKER_01]: countries and like they're destroying
habitats of You know, you're disturbing it
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's like there's still Costs to all
this shit like I personally rather have
[SPEAKER_01]: some nitrogen That was just like use a
little oil and pulled it directly out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking air Then some that some kid
toiled in a fucking fat cave in Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia somewhere, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like oh, yeah I think I'll talk to her
about this all the time and we all need to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a step or two down from our high
horses because if you're out there using
[SPEAKER_00]: an iPad if you're out there using a phone
if you're using a lot of modern day
[SPEAKER_00]: technology with some of these Battery
mines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's modern-day slavery, dude,
like I don't care anybody says those
[SPEAKER_00]: people It's sick bro, and we all
participated in some way or form whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you like it or not I mean my girlfriend or
my old lady we get into Shit talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: because she was really into organic stuff
when we got in, you know from a food
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and we were just talking about
how many like You know, cuz she's it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't like to kill animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's really into animals and shit like
that now we're just talking about how many
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Bugs and things and moles and I
mean her own dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, her own I mean mice die in a wheat
field when it gets harvested like deer or
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbits bro Go go to and her own dad farms
and when he would bush hog bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: go look how many buzzards are out there
Yeah, I'm saying like so it's but I get it
[SPEAKER_00]: though people want to there's a disconnect
between a lot of shit in life when It
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to stuff like organics, and I'm not
talking about we but food in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: You know as we've gotten away from killing
our own food and stuff like that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that something's happened to society
a little bit where you know growing up
[SPEAKER_00]: when maybe me and you were kids your dad
took you out to the fish your dad took you
[SPEAKER_00]: out to deer hunt maybe or squirrel hunt
stuff like that and you understood the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and it taught you the Understand the
meaning of life and and how to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: own food and you know if we didn't have
modern-day technology Where we would all
[SPEAKER_00]: be at and what we would need and skills
that we would need and require to survive
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think I think that shit's
important and I think you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know we're getting into deep deep
water This is a whole topic and not to get
[SPEAKER_00]: blue Part two, but if you like to come
back on in a month or so, bro I was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about probably like a four to six
week turn around maybe eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a max, but all of harvested by then
to hopefully so that's an update on the
[SPEAKER_00]: haystack Well, let's shoot for that cuz
that's that was the idea with having the
[SPEAKER_00]: people everyone back on because I told
