[SPEAKER_00]: Left the Department of Defense,
ironically enough, to finish the very
[SPEAKER_00]: mission they gave me in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a UFO guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a ufologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have been and never will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a counter-terrorism and
counter-espionage guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do counter-intelligence,
counter-insurgencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just so happens that in 2008,
I was asked to apply those same skill sets
[SPEAKER_00]: into the UFO community.
