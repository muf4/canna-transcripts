[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder's Syndicate 2.0,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_01]: clandestine scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researching everything from cannabis
strain history, old smuggling tales from
[SPEAKER_01]: the first-person perspective, to breeding
science and news on current subculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Matthew, and I'll
occasionally be joined by my homie
[SPEAKER_01]: Noxodon, Breeder and grower from
Mendocino, to speak on these subjects and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes interview other participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to document this history
before it's written by corporations and
[SPEAKER_01]: others who just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start writing some wrongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get started too much,
I gotta tell you, Francis, you tend to
[SPEAKER_05]: either cut off your head or your chin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like very common.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and you do have a very,
like, long, oval-shaped head, but still,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, try to back up off the camera a
little bit, so that don't happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're good, but every now and again,
you'll, like, reach in and it'll be like
[SPEAKER_05]: this, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Awkward moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what really hurts me is that,
like, if I put on my glasses, it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really awkward distance, so I can't see
that well without them, but then if I put
[SPEAKER_00]: them on, I have to be, like, way far back,
and that's awkward too, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sorry, you know, I'm,
like, all sweaty and don't have my phones
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I'm a cultivator,
not, like, a show personality like you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just left the garden in seconds again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to most shows, Matt and I are
pretty bare-bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to make the content speak for
itself rather than, like, all the fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: accoutrements that come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby and I used to go to so many concerts
together, and we would often have,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, joints of, like, dog and super dog
and different hybrids with us,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it got to the point where,
like, often people would, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were standing next to us,
it would smell so good, they would want to
[SPEAKER_00]: share it with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And him and I used to have these,
like, running debates if we should,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, share or not, because we had
literally been at events where,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, we shared a few times and,
like, people's knees would buckle because
[SPEAKER_00]: they got way too high, and then,
like, security would have to come and,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, help them, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, we got, we got to the point
where because... I can tell some stories
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you know, like,
the dog was like, I mean, it still is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, like, it was really a lot stronger
than what most people had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we smoked it every day, so we had a
certain tolerance to it, but there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people that, like, two,
three hits and, like, they'd be in a space
[SPEAKER_00]: they were a bit uncomfortable in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start by telling a story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start by telling a story when the
chem dog ruined somebody's day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went to a blues traveler concert at
the Greek theater.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, I believe it was 1991.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, can't be sure, but it was in the early
90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I used to see blues traveler when they
were just a bar band in New York City,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, playing, like, small clubs of,
like, 50 people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, then they got big and they
opened for Jerry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we're playing in the Greek
theater.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I went to the Greek theater early
to wait online to get in, to get a good
[SPEAKER_05]: spot, because, you know, if you're from
out here, you know, the Greek theater is
[SPEAKER_05]: generally general admission, which is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm, you know, waiting online and
I'm talking to people and I meet somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, I'm smoking online,
which I always do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy, you know, he asks,
you know, man, I tried that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he takes a hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Takes another hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he went from being this, like,
really excited, like jovial character to,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, just completely, like, and not
saying anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, he got so high that when the
show let in, like, he sat down before the
[SPEAKER_05]: line went in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the show let in, he didn't go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, bro, let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're letting us in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he just sat there and I'm like,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, well, I'm going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he waited online for hours to get a
good spot at the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I don't know if he ever made it
in because he got so high from two hits to
[SPEAKER_05]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I had this other experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one was that Phil did a show at the,
not the Maritime Hall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was called the Maritime Hall.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called the Philharmonia.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a singalong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought my camera and I was taking
pictures at this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, I'm smoking the dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this lady behind me asks if she can
hit my joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let her hit the joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I warned her at this point because I
had already had this experience with a few
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, oh, no, I smoke every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she takes a couple of hits off the
joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was behind me.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been taking pictures and I got
this film camera around my neck with a
[SPEAKER_05]: strap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing I know, she collapses and is
falling on top of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I spin around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I spin around, my camera spins
around and clocks are in the head.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a one, two punch.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was going down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going down from the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my camera clocks were in the
head.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she had to get taken to Rock Med over
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, what is she on?
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had a number of times when I
shared the chem dog with people and it
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't go good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after a while, I started just telling
people, like Francis said, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just makes them want it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought we were being dicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gabby and I would be having these
conversations like, are we going to ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: this person's experience by being cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: People thought I was stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would think you were stingy?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been telling everyone I'm stingy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 5,000 people on Discord that
think that Gabby is fucking just stingy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm holding on to it all, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, I don't know if you heard this
part, Gabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have mentioned a few times how when
we were making those super dog hybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: we were playing around and we were doing
all those out-crosses and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby was honestly one of the earliest
people amongst my entire friend crew that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of saw the future American seed sales
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to talk to me and be like,
dude, we could take this eight lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: because we did big seed runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take this eight lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, we could make so many seeds
with this eight lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just blow anything you could do
with flour out of the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could sell so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably early 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was long before seed companies in
America and IG made it feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly, we'd get into arguments and I
was like, I don't see it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see how we'd be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see how we'd be able to have
customers, all these people that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw what was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, it's not going to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 10 years later, I was like,
man, we were just like too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business models that are built on volume
and there's business models that are built
[SPEAKER_00]: on scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the margins are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have huge volume, you can have
smaller margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big volume, if you've got
big margins, you don't need huge volumes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's crazy because it's kind of
the same thing with clones right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: except it's more like people taking
advantage, like selling ships.
[SPEAKER_05]: For like $1,500 a piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just like a garbage cross that just
because they made a good name for
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the Emerald Cup, people will be
waiting online for the entire Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_05]: to pay $1,500 for clones that ended up
having virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of it is successful branding and then
not being honorable about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it sucks because I think it's a
flawed business plan because as soon as
[SPEAKER_05]: you build up your business to the point
where like you have all these people that
[SPEAKER_05]: respect you and think that you're awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden you fuck
everybody and the word gets out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, it's so much worse now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard a lot of stories about deals that
went bad with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know if you want to cut
this out because I ain't trying to talk
[SPEAKER_05]: shit about people, but you know,
he had contracts with people that he had
[SPEAKER_05]: to give them like, they had to give a
certain dollar amount for their crop and
[SPEAKER_05]: their crop got completely ruined because
it was all virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he still wanted his money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, like he destroyed these
people's livelihood by giving them like
[SPEAKER_05]: infected genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying he did it on purpose,
but like you give people infected genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you sue them for not giving you
the 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meanwhile, these people couldn't get
300 bucks or 400 bucks for like quality
[SPEAKER_05]: herb that was, you know, it was just like,
I mean, the thing is, is like Francis and
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, the seeds are so cheap,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That if you have a problem, like this is
an opportunity to show people that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: solid or that you're a scammer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That could have happened to anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That, you know, the seeds are no good,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need to be like, look,
we stand behind, you know, our name and
[SPEAKER_05]: our product and anyone that bought that is
going to get, you know, not just their
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds replaced.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to get extra stuff and yeah,
wasting their time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make the customer feel good because in the
end, the seeds don't cost you shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and like you took so much into
making your reputation.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you just screw so many people over,
let the whole world know that that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: terrible and fuck over your entire
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand how people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run into this all the time, Gabby,
when we chat, where it's like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times I will talk in generalities about
like certain things that go on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community, because even just telling
stories that are true, people get mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you mention, like when we,
if I mentioned somebody's name
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically as an example, their friends
will like cut out that 15 second clip and
[SPEAKER_00]: send it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll have like furious people in
my DMs all mad that I'm like trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: like fuck with their wallet or destroy
their way of life or like disparage them
[SPEAKER_00]: in some fashion, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one thing that I want to say,
that's not really a story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was not so dog or
someone else in the discord that said that
[SPEAKER_05]: while people appreciate me is that I
didn't flex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I thought about it and I
said, I said to myself, I'm not opposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: flexing for shit that actually I can flex
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't feel, I don't feel like I'm that
responsible for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's other things that I'm so much
more proud of, like my Hydro store,
[SPEAKER_05]: the garden is felt, you know, I had the
first real grow shops in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was spare time supply, but they sold
lights in the back of an ocean container
[SPEAKER_05]: to people that knew about them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I opened up, I opened up a grow store
in Willards at the time highway 101
[SPEAKER_05]: stopped being a highway and just was like
a one lane on each direction road through
[SPEAKER_05]: the town of Willards.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyone traveling North would drive
straight through town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got this little store on main
street.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I was saying was that when I put my
store up, it was right on highway 101 and
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally lit up the highway with the
orange glow of high pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the talk of the town.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like nobody could believe that I was being
so ballsy to like put these lights up in
[SPEAKER_05]: the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, one by one, you know,
the locals from the hills came down and
[SPEAKER_05]: they heard that they could trust me and
that I would deliver soil to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I delivered soil in the most dangerous and
not like dangerous, like gun dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the roads were just psychotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I would have known, I never would have
done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you get like committed to this
drive and now you can't turn around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving this like U-Haul style box truck
looks overloaded with soil through like 10
[SPEAKER_05]: creeks and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I taught a lot of people how to grow
weed and I taught a lot of people how to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow better weed than they were already
growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought new products to our market
and that's the stuff that I'm really proud
[SPEAKER_05]: of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not that I didn't always love
cannabis and always grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: but for a long part of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me take a step back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's how the story went.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was growing before working in and
owning hydro stores, I was paranoid and I
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't making friends and I wasn't talking
to people about growing weed, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: what I realized I really liked to do is
talk to people about growing weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is one of the reasons why me and not
so dog got along so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, cause that's what, what he wanted to
do too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happened was one day the hydro
store that I was shopping at it's called
[SPEAKER_05]: hydro depot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy asked me if I wanted a job.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at first I was like, no, I don't want
a job.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I I'm doing pretty good doing
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I realized that if I got this job
and I worked it for a few months,
[SPEAKER_05]: I could make a legitimate income and then
like maybe work towards buying a house
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of like, you know, renting my
entire life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started working at the hydro depot
and that's when I realized that as much as
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a passion for growing, I have a
passion for talking to people about weed
[SPEAKER_05]: and teaching people what I know about
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really felt like my calling was to
do that because not only was I making a
[SPEAKER_05]: good living, I was loving every minute of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when, when clients would come
in, I would love talking to them,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like, you know, I let other
people handle the inventory and the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, all the, you know, boring stuff
and running a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just talk to people about
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was always really honest with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why people came back,
you know, because they knew I wasn't just
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to sell them some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because oftentimes people would come in
and be like, should I buy this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd be like, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, perfect example was LED lights
before they were ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I opened up my store,
it was 2002.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was already people trying to sell
LED lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the UFOs, Francis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, they were garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, you couldn't successfully grow basil
with those plants, let alone a fruiting
[SPEAKER_05]: crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and they sold for a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I used to tell people, if this
technology worked, I would make so much
[SPEAKER_05]: money because everybody would want to
change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody with high-precious sodium would
immediately want to buy these,
[SPEAKER_05]: these LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I couldn't with good conscious.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though people coming in like
wanting the lights and I'd have to be
[SPEAKER_05]: like, no, it's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a very minor flex that I feel
throughout the years, I made a good
[SPEAKER_05]: reputation for myself with growers because
I was honest and I was a place where they
[SPEAKER_05]: could come for information and they felt
safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people felt safe at my store.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, so when we're talking about
flexing, it's like, I think I can flex
[SPEAKER_05]: about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm proud of, proud of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that that's, you know, it's going
to be a part of my legacy, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: when I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chem dog thing is just like,
you know, I'm blushing and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like kind of like, it makes me smile that
I'm getting this attention about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like Greg, he's the one that popped
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: People that he distributed to,
like, what do they get the credit for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, where do you draw the line of giving
people props?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it you, Francis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Jason and Ben or like people 10,
10 rows past them that got it,
[SPEAKER_05]: that maybe did better shit with it than
all of us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I mean, I look at it a
little different, you know, I'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about the chem dog for a second
and then I'll move on to the store because
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think there's some parts about
the store that people would not really
[SPEAKER_00]: realize today, but I'll start with the
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I think that, you know,
for whatever reason, even though it might
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, even though people might play a
small role in something, that role could
[SPEAKER_00]: be super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it turns out somehow that the cutting
that you brought West seems to be the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that survived and it got, and I'm not sure
if it would be around if you hadn't come
[SPEAKER_00]: out to California with it and then
eventually shared it with a few close
[SPEAKER_00]: friends like Skunk VA or IC collective or
myself or whoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like that might be
small, but it's also important because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a critical step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when they wanted it back on the East
coast, they had to get it from the West
[SPEAKER_00]: coast because that's where, and in
prohibition, right, where people get
[SPEAKER_00]: busted and people move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things change a lot of cool things got
lost, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of feel like my only part of
the chem dog story is really like hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: the stories early, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe helping to preserve it at a time
before it was famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, and so perhaps like on the,
on the, the store thing, people might not
[SPEAKER_00]: realize this, but one of the things that
Gabby was talking about, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: critical back then, was that information
on how to grow good weed was really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people that knew how to do it
wouldn't talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stores were also super rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Gabby is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he opened up his store, he was the
first.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to make me blush, Francis,
you can repeat yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I do feel like as, as Gabby
mentioned, when he opened up the store in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendocino County, there was like spare
time supply, which was a big player,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were predominantly a garden store
at an outdoor store and an amendment
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no indoor or greenhouse focused
store going on at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stores back then were actually rare,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there wasn't very many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having someone in a store that was
knowledgeable and willing to talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of a risque thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though proposition 215 had
happened, it was still very much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's, he, I think you sort of
opened up your shop at the very beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the 215 medical green rush here,
where there was all these people coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: our County and coming to Humboldt and
these different areas that were new,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had no idea what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, I want to set up a
garage and a greenhouse and I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a long time, it was like,
eventually stores became like,
[SPEAKER_00]: who had the best price and people were
more knowledgeable, but probably for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first five or six years that Gabby had a
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I mean, he sold stuff,
but it was also like, it was tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: education on what stuff those people
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the store in the early years
was basically like an, a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: educational model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as Gabby and then, you know,
educated people, they bought things from
[SPEAKER_00]: him because they literally hadn't,
they didn't know how to wire stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know about like, you know,
lighting boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know about fan movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know about any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, they didn't have money
and they're like, what's the best set of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment for my set of circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have this whole County that was
starting to really blow up and grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the funny thing about it is all the
stores that opened up, they were all my
[SPEAKER_05]: customers first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I literally, I literally taught them
everything that they knew about the
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize it today,
but like information was the thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: was super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People literally, they had money,
but they had no idea what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, what's weird about it too,
is that you start, like if you spent time
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you learned a bunch because people
would come to you not only to get set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they would come to you with like every
problem imaginable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would have to, and Gabby would
have to sit down with them and figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the more you help people solve
it, the bigger your like information or
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise or knowledge base grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone else brings up that same
problem, like you have, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think people today with all
the, all the forums and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information and all the internet and
everything really understand how hard it
[SPEAKER_00]: was to talk to people that knew how to
grow weed, even on the basic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and so probably the first five or
six years, his store was open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a boom time where everyone in Mendo
and Humboldt and all these places were
[SPEAKER_00]: just constantly setting up new stuff,
whether they were indoor, whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: were greenhouses, whether they were light
deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just an enormous boom of economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, and maybe 10% of the people knew
what they were doing and would come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: like would have a good idea of what they
wanted and battle on price and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often they would come in completely
oblivious, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so I, I, I just wanted to
mention that I don't think in today,
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2023, people understand like how ballsy
having a hydro store was and being willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to openly talk about, you know,
about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With people, you know, I mean,
that was the era where like you walk into
[SPEAKER_00]: a head shop and you say the word bong and
they toss you out in case you were
[SPEAKER_00]: undercover and they were going to shut
down your shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: For real.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was, you know,
there was a, so it was pretty risque.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like pretty out on the,
on the, on the cutting edge of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, to do that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an enormous amount of
people that got their start buying
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and buying soil and buying all
kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one thing I could mention is like,
when you opened your shop, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we were still all growing in likes in,
um, you know, in like a light warrior or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or per like Pete Moss mixes and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby was one of the first people to
really like preach about cocoa fiber and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it was going to revolutionize like
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, people had no idea what it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at all, you know, and it was brand
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I remember is that, you know,
cocoa fiber, if I, if I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, the reason why it became
popular was in Europe, they decided that
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted more environmentally friendly
medium to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rockwell wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were looking around for
something that was biodegradable and a
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they realized that there was these
giant piles of cocoa fiber and Sri Lanka
[SPEAKER_00]: and India and other places that were just
waste products that they shredded off the
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa to get to the coconut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they realized that if they started
buffering it and treating it the right
[SPEAKER_00]: way, that, you know, um, it could be an
excellent grow media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Gabby got some, and there was
stuff that was from like because in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: that was our HP certified, which basically
meant it was regulated and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed to be a certain level of
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started growing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember Gabby being like,
Oh my God, dude, like we pull pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: he pulled plants out of pots and be like,
look at these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally like, look at how white and
happy you look at, look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that point on, he was kind of
like a little bit of a prophet about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one had ever really heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his store had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think we, he got lucky in that
he was getting it from reputable sources
[SPEAKER_00]: and there, there was other people that
were getting it cheaper, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it full of like sea salt and it
was unbuffered and people were having
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmares in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I mean, his store was open right
at the time that like cocoa fiber first
[SPEAKER_00]: started percolating around and no one had
even heard of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, people back then they
didn't even know, you know, it was even
[SPEAKER_00]: simple stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why, six hundreds were better than
thousands because they were cooler and
[SPEAKER_00]: they gave you more points of life.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, there was a lot of stuff
that people consider basic now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was like, essentially in my opinion,
like hidden knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would just talk all day long to people
and they would write out all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: lists of stuff they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would hand the list to like an
employee and they would start filling it
[SPEAKER_00]: and he would turn around and he would talk
to the next person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he just talked about growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here's the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis was way better than I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, he was like, he had,
he had patients, you know, and I'm just
[SPEAKER_05]: like, always like, I'm trying to help
people as quickly as I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I mean, I wondered, it wasn't like I
was rushing him out the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to make a comfortable
environment, but I was just always busy
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing like, I tried myself and so my
hydro store was based on largely a Dutch
[SPEAKER_05]: model.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Dutch model was I went to Holland
and I went to the growth stores and they
[SPEAKER_05]: all had espresso makers there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had this idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I was working for Slavic,
she would always say to me, Gabby,
[SPEAKER_05]: I want them to buy and get out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I try to tell him is that the
longer they stayed, I got opportunities to
[SPEAKER_05]: sell them more stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he would see, he would see it as
I'm just talking to these guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, for 45 minutes about growing,
you know, and that, you know, he'd rather
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe sweeping the floor or something
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the end, what I was doing was
building a repertoire with the customers,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that they would trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they would shop exclusively at
our store and, you know, they would trust
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I opened up my own stores,
the garden spout, you know, I put a coffee
[SPEAKER_05]: bar in and I had chairs there for the
customers to hang out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was pretty unheard of for a
growth store was to make a place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I wanted it to be a cool place where
people want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and of course some people abused
the privilege and got annoyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'd have to ask him to leave.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, like it wasn't only
me talking to people, other people would
[SPEAKER_05]: like hear what people were saying and then
they would like interject.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it became like almost a gathering
point, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as far as how I got involved with the
Coco, it's because that's what the Dutch
[SPEAKER_05]: were doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I met people while I was in Holland at
the Horty fair, which is like a
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional ag show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and then when I opened up my store,
they had heard about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They came and visited me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, so the first one we would
buy because Coco and then Kana Coco.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I started trying to
source some myself from some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: reputable companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, like those are the things
that I want to be proud of.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, to me, that that's like a much
bigger you know, that's that's my minor
[SPEAKER_05]: flex.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think it's one thing I want to
say about the chem dog flex.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much of an asshole would I look like
if I did flex about my part with the chem
[SPEAKER_05]: dog?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think I'd be like I'd be looked
at like an asshole, like like you're
[SPEAKER_05]: saying other people think others are
assholes for doing that flex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the only one who's got the real
flex is Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and like anyone else past that,
it's just kind of like, all right,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you do with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like Francis said,
people did good shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Jason made beautiful crosses with
the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and who else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, them too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, people did great stuff with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's their flex.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they did with the chem dog,
not their like part of the chem dog story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they acquired it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and having said that,
like, I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't look.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy for Jason and Ben that,
like, this could help them in any way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, it's just not like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it goes back to a different era
where the way you got cuts, generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, back then was like you honestly
became good friends with someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you shared things and then you
did things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people would call it a
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day, it was more just
like, you know, friends doing cool little
[SPEAKER_00]: side projects together, you know,
like friends sharing cuts so we could help
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them alive because there was fires
and accidents and busts and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that could happen where you could
lose something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was much more informal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, you know, you know,
sometimes people would be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how do you get cuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like become friends with someone that
has cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not the reason why you became
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you have an honest relationship
with someone and then that leads to other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's almost like organic in
the way that it like it developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I don't know, that's just
kind of how I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I think it's very one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily a flex, but I think
it's very, very special to be someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: inspires someone else who does something
quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes a culture, whether it's sour,
whether it's cam, whether it's getting to
[SPEAKER_01]: the West Coast, but helping inspiring
other whether you're teaching growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of that to be able to like know on
your deathbed that you've left something
[SPEAKER_01]: behind that has inspired someone else and
made their life better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that's that, you know, I mean,
like that should be good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ultimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I said, like, if you called
up and said, hey, Gabby, I was talking
[SPEAKER_05]: with not so dog and we want to talk to you
about the garden spout and how you,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, accomplish so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it'd be like, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, I'm proud of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could actually like, you know,
you know, but like this idea that I had
[SPEAKER_05]: such an integral part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I had a little part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought it out to the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to minimize it either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, because I know if I didn't bring it
out, then it's not out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it's lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's that we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish the breeding projects that we did
produced more of like what I actually
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like more of a chem dog,
you know, terpene profile because we we
[SPEAKER_05]: did some great shit, but it just didn't
turn out that dog like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if I would have done that,
then I could have been proud of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I could have felt like I had more
of part of the chem dog history because I
[SPEAKER_05]: took it to the next step.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that is a reason for Jason and
Ben to flex, because that is what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're taking plant that pretty much it
would be a mistake for most people to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: it, period.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like unless you're looking to
use it for breeding, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like growing this for the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and having said that,
I want to grow it from flower again,
[SPEAKER_05]: because I feel like I have knowledge and
tools available to me now that I didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: have then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I could get it to show me
something, you know, better than back in
[SPEAKER_05]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the one thing I was mentioning
in the discord is leaf tissue sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't even thought of doing that with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've already done this at facilities
that I worked with, worked at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't know who to give credit to,
but somebody mentioned to me that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we've been looking in books at
this is what this deficiency looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: This what this deficiency looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally, what that means is this is
what a plant looks like when it has zero
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen or like it's not deficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just absent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and also or extreme deficiency.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also those photos never show you
what does deficiency look like when it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: number of elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like because what it's going to
look like is going to look different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, for years, the standard
thing was, oh, I had more cal mag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what kind of whatever it was,
just add more cal mag.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it always makes it green plants like
calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I did my testing, the testing
showed I needed more calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, but at least we're not just guessing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the testing is really
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like seventy five to one hundred
dollars per sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's very inexpensive and it gives
you a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the chem dog being the plant that
wants to consume itself prior to harvest,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, two weeks before you're
supposed to cut it, you'd have not a
[SPEAKER_05]: single green leaf left on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so hard to keep this plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With with the leaf analysis, we can learn
how to feed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feed it a little bit better and maybe keep
it greener a little bit longer and
[SPEAKER_05]: actually, you know, actually get a product
that is more like what we've been looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for all this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the one of the thing I might
mention if we're going to like flex for
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby here or whatever, is that's not what
time this is, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but but I know we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I used to I used to go into a
bunch of different hydro stores for
[SPEAKER_00]: various reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Gabby was the first person
that I knew that was really pumping tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, not like the Maristem stuff,
but like the profit, like the cleanliness
[SPEAKER_00]: and the propagation and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this guy, Bill Graham.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had these and he had these kits and
he Gabby used to have Bill come.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to come into the store and Gabby
would have him do demos of how to
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize like a tub, how to get clean,
how to like take clean cuts and like
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach and sterilize the cuts and then get
them into solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you, like as a as a grower,
it looked like some voodoo in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like at the time, nobody was
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was even thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nobody was nobody was applying that
to cannabis by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he had a whole shelf on his
store and he would invite Bill in and he
[SPEAKER_00]: would and they would do demos in the shop
and he would get people to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that was literally in the
early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's become like a big.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason that made me think of it
is as you were talking, Gabby,
[SPEAKER_00]: about leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I kind of feel like because weed was
so illegal for a while, we were reduced to
[SPEAKER_00]: observational stuff and we didn't really
have access to labs and we didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to some of the scientific
stuff that regular ag did because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: too scared and the labs didn't want to
deal with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to like work off what we saw and
talking amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's right in the sense that you
can go get tissue analysis and you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: hard data that backs up your thoughts.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, tissue culture was like
some voodoo, you know, taking these tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little plantlets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed very extreme at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why would you go through all that
trouble and you just club?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now knowing more about diseases,
you know, hops late and viral and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish everyone would have been using that
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Bill, Bill would come in
and and, you know, Gabby would tell a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of good customers and friends and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's going to come in and he's going
to give a demo and he's going to teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to use this stuff because it was like,
especially to a bunch of growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like some straight voodoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was advanced.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me say something real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me say something real fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I sold a bunch of those kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I honestly believe almost no one took
it out of the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it because it was still it was
still too like intimidating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the kit didn't cost shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was like one hundred and thirty
five bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was really inexpensive,
but they had to go buy a pressure cooker
[SPEAKER_05]: and make the gel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you know, I was able to sell a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like most people were still a little
bit intimidated to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember I was intimidated,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I had bought the kit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't do it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one day Bill Graham comes to the
store and we do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then every single day I was doing
tissue culture in my store in front of
[SPEAKER_05]: people that was just walking in.
And.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, even though they didn't do it,
they were still like inspired and it made
[SPEAKER_05]: them excited about something.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, a few people actually did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really thought I was going to
revolutionize things by like people
[SPEAKER_05]: adopting this and doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was kind of like the seed thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just weren't ready yet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this thing is interesting in that,
you know, I talk about this on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: quite often where it was like,
you know, Gabby and I and some other close
[SPEAKER_00]: like we honestly were just trying to make
better wheat and all the seeds we made,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the projects that we did, everything
like that, especially because of what like
[SPEAKER_00]: flour prices were back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a terrible financial decision
because we could have just been blowing up
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms of flour and getting top dollar for
it way back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it was literally like a labor
of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was it wasn't necessarily
about like, oh, what do we think people
[SPEAKER_00]: will like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, what do we like personally?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we make stuff that we like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Gabby, I was thinking about
it because Matt and I have been blessed in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to talk to some of like Neville's
good friends that were close to him in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last years of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because one of the things
Neville said is like, I wish I didn't fail
[SPEAKER_00]: so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the best stuff that I got,
I improved on it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew that I wish I would have
known then what I know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a different shot at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that thing that you
expressed is very common in breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: where people that breed are very
self-critical and they tend to discount
[SPEAKER_00]: what they did when they did it because
they wanted it to be better and they had
[SPEAKER_00]: their own goals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of has to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take it serious, there has to be a
lot of failure because you just be
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting, you know, numbers all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not how I mean, I don't think it's
failure in the sense of you produce
[SPEAKER_05]: something beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a failure in the sense of you have an
expectation of what you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: produce and you have a lot less control of
it than, you know, because that's just
[SPEAKER_05]: ego.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, either that or it's really
expert breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or really anal, attentive people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you would think like, so when we
did the F1 cross, you know, with back to
[SPEAKER_05]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we grew out so many thousands of
these seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would have thought that some would
have like really been dog like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they just weren't.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so you would think like,
you know, when you do that first cross,
[SPEAKER_05]: you get the most diversity and now you
just got to do the hunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the skunk was so dominant.
That.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was traces of it, you know,
like, yeah, not like it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dogweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other thing, the other thing
I think we should mention, because like
[SPEAKER_00]: the game is flipped now, but is that when
Gabby and I were doing all this,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the feminized reversals and stuff like
that were still years away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of thought that like at times that
like hermaphrodism and like accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinations were going to lead you down
the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff that we did was with regular
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you had to create hybrids and then
and back cross and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we had to grow out the
seeds to see if what we did did what we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no idea that we could take two
females and reverse one of them and add
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all regular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we knew we could do it, but would
never consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were already selling seeds by that time
feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that hermaphrodism and seeds
from hermaphrodism were risk
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditism because you were going to
infect your line with more traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: were bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and that was just kind of
like, I don't know, in the early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that was just the common thread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still uncertain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still uncertain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking to Matthew about this the
other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like to me, like.
It's.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like it's very common.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know it's common.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's oh, and I know it's commonly
done, but I still feel like doing this has
[SPEAKER_05]: to pose some type of risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, it's common for people to feel
like you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you think we're wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think I think you're totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to an extent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this proven by genetics, like by
genetic mapping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe it's just hard for males to
accept that, like we might become
[SPEAKER_00]: irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's actually normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would accept that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would accept that more than the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cannabis plant male is the most
unappreciated plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've gone to a point where regular
seeds are, you know, unicorns almost in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost everything is feminized
reversals of some fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when Gabby and I were doing it,
like, you know, the only feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew of were, you know, accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accidents.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never heard of reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reversals we had ever heard of
then was like you stressed the hell out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to encourage it to hermaphrodite
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in a small container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave it drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You messed with the light sky cycle until
it freaked out and did some weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no sprays we ever thought about
trying to like induce anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like you basically like tortured
the plant until it did what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the tech that we knew of back
then, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just seemed like the wrong path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's very common for people
from your era to still have that mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody we've talked to on here from
your exact era all have that same opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: still to this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, you know, I mean,
so I always say that you're old when you
[SPEAKER_05]: think you know everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm glad that like I'm not
confident about this and that every day my
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion might be going more towards
towards yours, Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in our conversation we had,
I feel like selfing could be more
[SPEAKER_05]: problematic or it seems like, you know,
could have more potential for problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so one thing like we're talking about
Colin from Ethos, like he said something
[SPEAKER_05]: and it seems so obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, how can I go my whole life and
not think of this?
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you cross two females,
you have a so much better idea of what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like trying to judge, trying to judge
what male was the right one to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I don't, you know, you have to
be, you have to be very, very adept or
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very repetitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to do things over and over again,
you know, and then do a lot of testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is almost impossible to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how does one grow out thousands of
seeds and preserve every single clone of
[SPEAKER_05]: every one trying to smoke every female.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we would do, Gabby and I would do
this thing where we settled kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were doing the super dog stuff is
like, I think we picked out like our seven
[SPEAKER_00]: or eight favorite males based on like
looks and certain traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we put them all in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so usually like the ones with the cute
butt cheeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them all in the room and then,
you know, they get to a certain point,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you beat them with a, with a,
you know, a bamboo stake or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the fans are on and you just like
the pollen would just spread everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, well, it's going to make
the hunt harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we don't know which male is
doing the right thing was the one we
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted is just find the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanted maximum diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how, that's how you're going to
get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to be so arrogant that like you can
pick it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't us, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So like having, having three or four males
in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a big, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of finding that needle, needle in the
haystack.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way we presented it when we gave them
to see they're all going to be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the two phenomenal plants
crossed together.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, they're all going to be
good, but you know, you've got to grow a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of them and you're going to find,
you know, a few that are super amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember Gabby?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, one of the final, one of the final
breedings we did, like I was trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was racking my brain for their names and
their names really aren't important,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, but you had these buddies of
yours and they gave us a version of the
[SPEAKER_00]: black Domina and they gave us that
warlock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two things, because we did this,
when we did the, like the, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: final super dog readings, we basically put
these like, I don't know, seven or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: different males that we had picked in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of the super dog females that we
liked, and then literally like every good
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that we could get access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the dog and we had the super
skunk and we had the, and we had the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Mendo P and we had the
warlock and we had the black Domina and we
[SPEAKER_00]: had, I mean, like literally every good
female cut that him or I had, we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered them all up and we put them in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you found the one, you didn't care
what made the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just needed to find the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing what it was, knowing what it was
would have been helpful to try to do more
[SPEAKER_05]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, for instance, I don't remember
who gave me the black Domina, but I
[SPEAKER_05]: remember the reason why we bought it was,
and I think that was like from Sensi Seed
[SPEAKER_05]: or we purchased seed from some seed
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: The description said, extremely spider
mite resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so the weed was garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really wasn't that good, but if we
could make our weed more like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we could cross it with a,
you know, not so dog and get a plant that
[SPEAKER_05]: was good quality and spider mite
resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so that's why that, that's why
that one was in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the other one that you mentioned,
Francis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the warlock?
[SPEAKER_00]: They both came from the same people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember who gave me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were your buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither was that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're comparing it to chem dog,
I imagine not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the funny thing is like there's
things where I felt exactly how Gabby
[SPEAKER_00]: felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years later I was like,
man, I was just like discounting too many
[SPEAKER_00]: things because they weren't like my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean they weren't valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that like they weren't in my
top couple, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I got older, I appreciated
different qualities to weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where in the beginning it was
kind of like, I don't know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanted that weed that tasted amazing
and like hit you across the head with a
[SPEAKER_00]: two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way, you know, I wanted to cover sour
a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we talked a little bit about how you
met Klopp, but what were some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: impressions of sour?
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I didn't have many until much
later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: When was your first experience?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and we used to grow a lot of it,
you know, um, I don't remember exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: when it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the deal with it was it was
a highly productive strain of beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: weed that we could sell easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I was, I was on the discord
and somebody had to remind me or tell me
[SPEAKER_05]: that most of the people in the discord are
really small growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they grow in a, in a tent and it's
for personal use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, there's a big difference
between that and even somebody that grows
[SPEAKER_05]: in his garage, you know, has a 10 lighter
in his garage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you do need to make some money to pay
for your expenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole reason why you put up 10
lights in your garage was to make a little
[SPEAKER_05]: money in the first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to, you have to do what's
marketable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of the reason why we gave
up on the chem dog in the first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, when you're getting such a
terrible yield, you know, off of this
[SPEAKER_05]: plant, like we couldn't justify,
like we'd have to sell it for 50 to a
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred percent more than we would to
sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't getting that much more for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so like we would keep it and
we'd grow a little bit for our headstache.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Francis said, you know,
somebody was growing it and we would all,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, share a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The shit would never get sold because
we're growing such a small amount of it
[SPEAKER_05]: that, you know, it didn't make it to the,
to the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and you know, I want to, I want to
publicly say this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I say that louder?
[SPEAKER_05]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make a living working in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to do that, it's like a total
different thing than when you're just
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to grow for yourself, whether it's
in your backyard or in your tent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it is, if I was growing just for
myself, I would just grow OGs.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what I like to smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, whether it's the chem dog or,
you know, other really nice OGs,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's really the palette that I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and actually I should say this,
we just want to have a diversity,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then there's that always the staple
that I go to every morning, but then I'll
[SPEAKER_05]: mix in some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I love sativa turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love citrus turps, you know,
I love to have a variety, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I was telling you guys, I smoked
these soft parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have like 30 different types of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are so aggressive that it's
shocking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost offensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still awesome, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but still I still always lean towards
the OGs is what I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, right now in California, in the
commercial marketplace, it's hard to sell
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and in the,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's been going on for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, you know,
like in the discord, people are hating on
[SPEAKER_05]: gelato, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But fuck that's what, that's what,
that's what big farms just want to buy
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like people want to buy lots of
gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so let me tell you a mistake that I
made.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a new nursery, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have all these genetics that are
super awesome, but nobody knows anything
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you try to sell people on this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with today's market, they need to know
that they're getting a home run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's so hard to get them to try
something new, you know, when right now
[SPEAKER_05]: they can sell all the lemon cherry gelato
they can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so like, when, when I started this,
I didn't have a lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, by the time I get this thing
in mass production, it's going to be like
[SPEAKER_05]: the ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, like nobody's going to want
this weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, but like it's managed to have
lasting power as far as the demand for the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower and the clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're growing a 10 lighter in your
garage, you're really better off,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, growing something that people
want, you know, and then maybe a small
[SPEAKER_05]: section of it for your own personal,
which is what Francis and I did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we, we always do a little bit of
a chem dog, but like we had to go to a
[SPEAKER_05]: strain that was more productive and that
people wanted to buy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the funny thing about the super
skunk is the most beautiful weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the chem dog was the best super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: My, I think that weed is the most
beautiful weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the way it looks too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was green and frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it smelled like crazy and it was super
pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a kind of aroma that like is very
universally recognized by Americans as
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think too, that like,
to the point that Gabby was making,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's weird in that if certain strains
don't leak and they don't get out to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of people, then the demand
for them can't grow, which then makes
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it much harder because we would
try to sell the chem dog and they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, ah, this is kind of like some like
bag seed OG or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how good could it be if I don't have
access to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since there was only like a few
garages or something like that and a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or two that was trying to grow
some, it was like brokers want to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to them, that wasn't a home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was before the forum fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was before it got like a really big
name for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For itself in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people just wanted things that was
going to be something easy for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of decisions where I mean,
the, I was just going to say that a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in Mendo, you know,
in Humboldt and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times what broker, what growers
grew, what was what they heard the brokers
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted and was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a few years there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, if we wanted to go back
and talk about, um, like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby's store, like every big indoor
grower in Mendocino County was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of purple Urkel or granddaddy
perps or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember how many Laytonville indoor
gardeners, Gabby were growing and Urkel
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, and Urkel, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granddaddy perps, you know, all those
types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then the market shifted and it
went to sour and Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those growers dropped the purples
and went right into what the brokers want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a, you know, there's a lot
there where it's like, you might end up
[SPEAKER_00]: liking a strain, but you end up growing a
small amount of it for you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times you end up growing what
the, you know, the majority of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is what you think the brokers or the
market wants to absorb relatively easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my new strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to have 30% of exclusive stuff
that, you know, I'm bringing to the
[SPEAKER_05]: market, you know, one way or another,
I want to have 30% of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: up and coming from known people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 30%, but that only ends up to
90%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 33% of each 33% of stuff that people
want right now, you know, that way I can,
[SPEAKER_05]: I can sell people what they want now while
creating a demand for products under my
[SPEAKER_05]: brand, as well as partnerships with
existing brands, you know, but thinking I
[SPEAKER_05]: could do it all with like exclusive stuff
that nobody knows anything about,
[SPEAKER_05]: even though like it's fire weed that won
the emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, that, that takes a little
bit more today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of legal, a lot of legal farms,
they're sort of drowning under upfront
[SPEAKER_00]: fees and costs and taxes and operating
expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they real, their margins are a lot of
times quite tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really want home runs because
they're worried about survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not for elite, especially
for, you know, for most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a particularly lucrative time in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of more of like a stay afloat
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the, the more it's like that,
the more people want certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that leads to sameness because
people want, it hurts the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts quality and it hurts diversity
because people are just trying to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: an already popular thing at a low cost and
get somebody to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's risky, like he was just saying,
to try to promote fire that you personally
[SPEAKER_00]: think is amazing, but the market might not
think that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you have the capacity to like
convince them or are you just going to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: on it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's different than when your market was,
you were showing your friends your weed
[SPEAKER_05]: and smoking some with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, then it was easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's like selling it in bulk to
whether it's a distributor or a broker.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, everybody, it's too far from the
final person for people to be taking these
[SPEAKER_05]: risks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're just pumping the gelatos,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And realistically, like today,
I think in California, most commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: farms, they have some type of gelato in
their rotation, you know, because the
[SPEAKER_05]: market is calling for it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the consumer, I don't want to call
them idiots, but they're uneducated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's also, to be fair to them,
Gabby, it's also hard to make new
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions when you walk into a legal store
and everything that you want to check out
[SPEAKER_00]: is in a sealed opaque mylar that they
can't touch it, smell it, smoke it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or get excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have to like spend a bunch of
money on it and then hopefully when they
[SPEAKER_00]: open it up, it's something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the way these mylars are
designed, you don't even see the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: inside it until you've walked out of the
store and purchased it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look at what percentage THC it
is, whatever has the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they've been told.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even if a farmer, even if a
farmer wants to take risks, it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: on the farmer, the distro and the
dispensary also has to be willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: promote that to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmer oftentimes doesn't even have
control over whether or not the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to get educated properly on why
they think it's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really try our best to reach out
to bud tenders with this show as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as crazy as it sounds, like they're the,
the, the last point before the customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want them to be at least be the
most educated out of the whole ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're the ones who interact the
most with the customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know what I was,
I was remembering Gabby and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a totally random story,
but Gabby and I did a project together
[SPEAKER_00]: where we built this greenhouse on a
property he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, we thought it was, we thought it
was a huge greenhouse at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now it's like laughably small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but do you remember when we grew,
uh, the Maui dude and those buds were so
[SPEAKER_00]: big, we took those pictures where your
head was behind the Cola and all you could
[SPEAKER_00]: see was your ponytail and like your ears
sticking out because there was these giant
[SPEAKER_05]: Colas coming up high time, the classic
high time submission photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you know, we'd see in high
times is like a butt in front of their
[SPEAKER_05]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we had these giant face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, you know, we grew, I don't,
I mean, we had Urkel and Maui and super
[SPEAKER_00]: dog and various things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things probably burned in your fire,
but at some point we had all these
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and that's hard too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was thinking about it and it's
like before phones had cameras on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was so many less pictures taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so many less, you know,
um, Gabby had some nice cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took some really cool photos of
various things that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but all it took was a fire or a bust
or an accident or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that history would be lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always remember that like a,
Gabby's head behind these Maui buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: all you could see was like, he used to
have this really long ponytail and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you could see was a part of the
ponytail and maybe the corner of one ear
[SPEAKER_00]: because the bud was like, you know,
cause my ears are fucking big,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean, it was pretty risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, you know, I think like we
started on it, the greenhouse was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be 20 by 50 and Gabby thought that was
enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shrank it to 20 by 30 and he was,
it still seemed like, like it was ballsy,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, within a few years it was on the
top of the hill in an open field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a few years later,
that kind of stuff was a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: than norm, but at the time it was coming
out of the tree lines and it was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the indoors and it was coming out
of these tiny little scenes and it seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in that regard and, uh,
you know, even the idea that you could put
[SPEAKER_00]: something like you just said in like an
open field and you wouldn't get in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually get away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That always blew my mind about up there in
the Emerald triangle that anybody could do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like you could, you cannot do that
here still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's, it's, it was always a game of
cat and mouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like our thinking on it was, so there was
like a generally like well-known or maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: it was wrong, but we always thought like,
as long as you have under a hundred
[SPEAKER_05]: plants, then it becomes the, like the feds
aren't going to want to deal with this and
[SPEAKER_05]: the local cops, they're dealing with much
bigger people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the greenhouse, they could never
actually, and actually you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_05]: medically have 25 plants at this time,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the greenhouse was like,
you can't really see what's in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you can't see what's in there,
then, you know, we felt a little safer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was just, you know, we were
kidding ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you could smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you can't smell it from a
helicopter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you could, you wouldn't know what
you're smelling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause everyone was growing up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a remote.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole idea was just like, wait,
keep it, keep it kind of small and make it
[SPEAKER_05]: not worth the trouble of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the issue that we never thought of is
we had a perfect landing pad over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could have like landed 10 helicopters
up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't like the shady, like a
sketchy mountainside terrain, like they
[SPEAKER_05]: have no place to put it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they had like a flat motor fucking
landing pad over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they wanted to fuck with us,
it would have been bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll bring this up just because I
just thought of it, but like when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the skunk, you know, like that
spot we were just talking about was remote
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really didn't have neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you were too worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we were growing the skunk inside,
it was kind of before the carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like where you had like,
uh, you know, the UOV Nair, like the ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: generators and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd grow that skunk and like two
weeks before it was done, you'd pull up
[SPEAKER_00]: into your driveway with your windows down
and you'd be like, Oh my God, it smells
[SPEAKER_00]: for 50 yards in every direction around my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm slaughtering skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used to do all these things like
caulking and like venting and trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just beat every effort we had to
try to contain the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was uncontainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and some people would get rid of
it because it was too fragrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like caused panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like the skunk.
The skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, Francis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reeks so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: He don't know anymore than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows that, he knows it might've been
super skunk or skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the thing about it is for me is
that I always thought, Gabby, that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that, you know, you get,
when I, when I, when you gave me clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like, you gave me the dog and you
gave me, and you gave me skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just by your story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been thinking about this too.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, and I know how important
this is to so many people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I explicitly remember getting the
skunk from the dude in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, that plant isn't the one that
looks just like the, the sensei seed
[SPEAKER_05]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had gotten, we had gotten the seeds
from sensei and that's how we got our
[SPEAKER_05]: original crops that we were meant,
uh, that, you know, then we got the males
[SPEAKER_05]: from to, to make everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like super dog and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, so that, so that's the way I
remember it, but as such an important part
[SPEAKER_05]: of history, you know, I'm not signing any
David's or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all, that's all anyone wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you don't quite have an answer and
it's best guess, that's the best guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's more advanced than we were
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I mean, I will repeat the same
story the next time I speak to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said that somebody was telling
the story and every time they told it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'm going to tell it
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is a lot different than
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also not swearing to accuracy,
you know, for a smokehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is it's a, it's a,
it's a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's literally decades ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ask yourself the question, Francis,
didn't we get the seeds in order to make
[SPEAKER_05]: the first cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing is that when we were
talking earlier, you were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we just use the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had that from the senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had that one female, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you, that like, that you gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how that one female came
to be because by the time that I came into
[SPEAKER_00]: it, like you gave me the skunk,
you gave me skunk and dog the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't, you don't have it anymore,
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it when I got in trouble and you
know, whenever that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does anyone give a shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, because, because one of them,
one of them is probably in sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is probably in chem dog D
and diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're very, I think, so I think
that's true, but I mean, if we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: it then like, but we have the,
we have the last two and we would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: know kind of which one went where,
cause people don't believe us on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: on that little part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's not believed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what part is not believed that,
uh, like the chem dog D it would,
[SPEAKER_01]: would have the same super skunk chem 91
connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: They still think it's sister.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't, they don't believe us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We disagree with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably neither of us will ever be proven
right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can just enjoy this debate for the
rest of our life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I mean, like we don't have enough
source.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have the source material beyond
people's words.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, to, to do it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we need to have all the genetics,
maybe if we had all the genetics and
[SPEAKER_05]: futuristic technology, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we, we already don't have all the
possible genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could, I can identify it from a photo of
a bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody was growing it, like the weed
is so unique and it looks just like the
[SPEAKER_05]: f*****g sensei seed catalog photo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's the only weed that I've ever
grown that you could do that with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you, I there, there are people
that think it's, I mean, this causes all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of debate because what happens now,
Gabby is that people, people get,
[SPEAKER_00]: get excited about old school famous
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's opportunists that are
like, I found it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sell you clones for high
dollar or I'm going to make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids with seed and you'll be able to
get it in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a bunch of fakes that
proliferate about various stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these, there's all this
politics.
[SPEAKER_05]: The buyer must, the buyer must be where
they must be where and like, and that's,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's why you buy seeds from a
reliable source.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like riot seed go, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if not, you know, like,
you know, the buyer must be aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, if you're only paying,
you know, even a hundred dollars a pack,
[SPEAKER_05]: $150 a pack, you know, you can roll the
dice when you got situations like
[SPEAKER_05]: companies that should be remain unnamed
that are selling packs for a thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: bucks or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you really want to know you're
getting something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think genetics are worth that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're actually getting what you're
promised.
[SPEAKER_05]: If, if someone is saying, this is what
you're getting, this is what you can
[SPEAKER_05]: expect.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what, you know, I think,
you know, genetics can be worth thousands
[SPEAKER_05]: of dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're dealing with unreputable
people and the thing about unreputable
[SPEAKER_05]: people is they get called out pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like the other person we were
talking about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, well, what happens, you know,
what happens is Gabby is, is that
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, because we don't have genetic
testing and because we don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed, what we have is we have
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these stories get, you know,
like there's people that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they buy into the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's people that are like,
that guy's a scumbag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy his story at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Francis, if we answer, if we answer
these questions, life would be extremely
[SPEAKER_05]: boring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people would have no lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, like what are these people
going to do when they stop arguing or,
[SPEAKER_05]: or the skunk is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's funny things where like,
when I would tell, when I would tell those
[SPEAKER_00]: stories on previous podcasts, there would
be people that would get all mad at me and
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like, you don't know the dude
that brought them West.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were never really friends with that
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking making it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know what to tell you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't you call me, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got his fucking phone number right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, you see it's here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I was honestly like,
I would rather people that are just
[SPEAKER_05]: stepping in while Francis said was pretty
accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: The anything that was inaccurate or not
completely accurate was maybe some
[SPEAKER_05]: timelines and minor details that really
don't change the story much at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like the basis of the story is
the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, honestly, I think you did a
better job than I would have been able to
[SPEAKER_05]: just because you know, you've been
thinking about it for longer and you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've, you've spelled it out in your mind
and possibly on paper what you've thought
[SPEAKER_05]: about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He obsesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those stories just come from like a
million times of like me and Gabby sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: on a couch somewhere, stoned, shooting the
shit about week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it all came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just friendship sharing stories
about this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, that's honestly like why I
believed Gabby so much more than some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the later stuff that came up was because
he didn't have a reason to lie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was way before the fame was years and
years before skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg on the forums and anybody knew
chem dog, like the public hadn't heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just stories amongst friends and he
was able to, it was always the same story,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how bad or pride you guys were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just friends sharing stuff,
you know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and Gabby and I had a very
similar view on weed in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: like we both liked really good weed and we
both wanted to make better weed if we
[SPEAKER_00]: could, you know, I almost did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost didn't say it, dude, but like way
back in the day, I liked sativas and like
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby hated them because he was like,
dude, I'm so high strung.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want weed to like calm me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, maybe you're so calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get like a little anxious or a
little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't want to do that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to mellow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're mellow enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to smoke sativa and get all zippy
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I need to be brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be, I need to be mellowed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were telling me to chill out too.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were like, Gabby, chill the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to have to stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to stop this in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll continue again tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say this is that California is a
bunch of, you know, there's, it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: chiller, you know, Gabby coming from,
you know, being a New York Jew coming
[SPEAKER_00]: West, he was loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought it was aggressive,
but it was like where he came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody talks like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was normal as normal could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just like, you know,
it wasn't anything weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, you know, there's cultural
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You move from the East coast or New York
to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not culturally the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I moved from Chicago to, you know,
to, uh, to Mendo, I was like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, I'll end it on this
cause Gabby's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, uh, uh, my best friend growing
up that became really good friends with
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away a long time ago,
but you know, he used to do this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: where he'd call it California nice and
he'd be like, if you want to tell me,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck you, just tell me, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be nice to me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tell me, you know, I have no
interest, you know, piss off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me add one thing to that before you
go, before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember, uh, when I first got to
California, it totally freaked me out when
[SPEAKER_05]: like a cashier would start making
conversation with the person in line in
[SPEAKER_05]: front of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in front of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm next in line.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm next in line.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a beautiful day.

great weekend.

bring her up so I can get my shit and get
[SPEAKER_05]: the hell out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like now, now I say hello to everyone at
the supermarket and I, and now I'm that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
