[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders' Syndicate,
where we explore the history of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine scene through the eyes of the
folks who live it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll occasionally be joined by my co-host,
Not-So-Dogs, breeder and grower from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so yeah, I decided, like you
know, I mean we talk all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been trying to figure out the whole
Super Skunk fiasco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the point of where, I guess,
how do we want to label certain people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean we can just call Skunk Va
Skunk Va, since everybody knows
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's familiar with that moniker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with the others.
[SPEAKER_03]: ChemDog is ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another familiar moniker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk Va and my old buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think during the podcast he called him
his buddy from Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's do that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a private dude and kind of out of
the scene at this point, so we're just
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna like not say his name out of respect
and that he's long you know, his part is
[SPEAKER_03]: important but long ago, so out of respect
for him we won't, we'll just refer to him
[SPEAKER_03]: in code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strangely, he's one of those rare people
in the industry that is not seeking past
[SPEAKER_03]: fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no it's not P-Bud guys, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is actually the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so let's start with, where do you
want to start the Super Skunk story at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should we start it at?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so my buddy from Staten Island,
him and Skunk Va were very good friends
[SPEAKER_03]: and they used to travel and tour together
dead tour days, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the early 90s, a dude wanted to
move out to the West Coast in California
[SPEAKER_03]: and he was more into seeing Jerry Garcia
shows than he was into seeing the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: dead, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jerry would play at the Warfield
basically every month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, like a big-ass hippie gathering at
the Warfield, you know, and so my buddy
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of stopped touring, moved to Sonoma
County and started seeing every Jerry show
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so obviously Jerry shows are,
you know, they're like honey to deadheads,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you know, so a whole bunch of deadheads
would always attend the shows at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Warfield, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Skunk Va being from Virginia,
right, a lot of his old crew and mentors
[SPEAKER_03]: and various things like that were East
Coast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one time some of these guys came out
and from the East Coast and they were
[SPEAKER_03]: partying with all those guys at the
Warfield, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Skunk Va and I's mutual friend used to
have this strain called the Francine,
[SPEAKER_03]: all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about Francine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little offset, but tell us about
Francine a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Francine is a mystery indica that we
didn't use the term at the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was about as terpy as terpy gets.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually dude dropped it because like a
lot of Afghans, it had a horrific mold
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you know, you know, when you grow
things that horrifically look beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: and horrifically mold at times,
it's very depressing harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened to you a few times with a cut
and you can get PTSD and decide to drop
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people get emotional about it,
so.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does she smell like?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was a really good combination
of like that Afghan kind of acrid funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with like a fruity aspect,
but not like the tropical sativa kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just had like a really deep like foot
funk fruit kind of flavor to it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so these dudes loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they loved it so much they were
willing to trade this skunk that they had
[SPEAKER_03]: for it, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So separately to all this story and Skunk
Va's kind of talked about this extensively
[SPEAKER_03]: on his podcast, so I'll just briefly touch
on it.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Chem Dog wouldn't give out the dog,
which is what we call it, to anyone,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He held it tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't want anybody in his circle
getting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't want to get cut off,
you know, or have other people sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when Homie moved to California,
he agreed, look, I'll give it to you if
[SPEAKER_03]: you just don't ever share it with anybody
back East.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to compete markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what happened is that Skunk
Va arranged with his buddies to trade the
[SPEAKER_03]: Francine for the skunk.
Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude decided to make a double trip where
he would bring the Francine out to
[SPEAKER_03]: Virginia and he would trade it for the
skunk and then he would drive up to
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts and he would get the Chem
Dog that was promised to him, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that's committed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is committed.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1993, Homie drove across a bunch of
shady ass states with living plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not very many and small,
but still, you know, still fancy if he got
[SPEAKER_03]: pulled over, he probably would have had to
eat them, you know, or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have the state checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to do all kinds of, you know,
this was actually pre-pre to use a term we
[SPEAKER_03]: joke about most of the highway 80 drug
checkpoints and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in 93.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they really hadn't gotten wise to that
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you took the middle route, you were
pretty much safe for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could still get pulled over,
you know, and he definitely looked like a
[SPEAKER_03]: hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he wasn't secret sauce or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't look like a young Republican or
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, so he drives out to Virginia and
[SPEAKER_03]: meets what we just learned actually
recently ended up being dude's actual
[SPEAKER_03]: worker because the dude had already kind
of gone on the run for a bit and was
[SPEAKER_03]: weaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he gets this, this super skunk cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to interject as far as we know,
the person we're referring to,
[SPEAKER_00]: not by name, the Staten Island guy,
that as far as we know, this is skunk VAs
[SPEAKER_00]: mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how close we can put skunk VA
to the beginning of this cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as we know, the guy that agreed to
do it is the mentor, but apparently the
[SPEAKER_03]: guy that actually did the trade is one of
his workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I asked when all this confusion came
up a few years ago, I re I asked Staten
[SPEAKER_03]: Island, do you remember the exchange well
enough to be absolutely sure?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did he call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you fast forward to like when I became
friends with these guys in the late
[SPEAKER_03]: nineties, it was always called super
skunk, right?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Staten Island, he gets, you know,
he told me that straight up dude said,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a super skunk cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he gets it straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he trades, he gets it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he drives to Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he meets up with chem dog and he gets
the 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all call it the dog, but you know,
everybody on the internet calls it skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: VA cut or 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everybody back then, it was just the
dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of these dudes were organic
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to put chem on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy, they weren't super into calling
it chem dog because they grew fully
[SPEAKER_03]: organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so we just drew a dog and amongst all
of us long before it got famous or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that, that's just kind of
the shorthand.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've been writing that on labels
now for two decades, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So he got an extra cut or two of this
super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave one to chem dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, so chem dog got it basically by
accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got it by proxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like I accident by proxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got it because homie decided to go to
Virginia before Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a, what a wild, he could have
reversed it and gone Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_03]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Home.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he went Virginia, Massachusetts home.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That act, that choice, in my opinion,
I mean, we've talked about this a bunch or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever that ended up leading to a whole
series of accidental events that became
[SPEAKER_03]: super important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, so then he drives back
home, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now he's got super skunk in the dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you went to, to Warfield shows in
San Francisco to see Jerry band,
[SPEAKER_03]: you probably could have seen him slinging
all that in front of the show every single
[SPEAKER_03]: month.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, um, so Skunk Faw took a different tact
and he could speak to this for himself,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he kept touring basically,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when Jerry died in August, uh,
this next week here, we call this the days
[SPEAKER_03]: between because Jerry's birthday is on the
1st of August and his, his death is on
[SPEAKER_03]: the, is in a week now or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are like Easter for hippies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like the, yeah, it's the,
it's the Easter week or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, you know, Skunk Faw decided to
settle down after Jerry passes,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when he started growing,
you know, cause obviously to grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to be semi-stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really a dramatic lifestyle,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, so those pictures that he's been
posting of Polaroids and everything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that are after our buddy gave him the cut
from his friends in Virginia and he
[SPEAKER_03]: started growing it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that's basically how, that's
basically how this, this cut from Virginia
[SPEAKER_03]: made its way to Sonoma County,
the Bay and Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see, and then this is a great intro
to, to the chem dog story as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we will cover in our podcast,
which we'll eventually be here soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so that's the start of, that's the
start of the Super Skunk movie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I, uh, I met, uh,
I didn't know them then personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met a couple of years after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, my, you know, my,
uh, my buddy, uh, he fell in love with the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo P couple other things or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he ended up giving me the Super
Skunk and the dog for safekeeping,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and, uh, and that's in the late
nineties and that's kind of how I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've had it, uh, well like not the
Super Skunk, but the chem 91 and it stayed
[SPEAKER_00]: with you ever since.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had that since I never lost it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, unfortunately the Super Skunk was
lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but we'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, so we have this stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, this is obviously,
um, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so late nineties, 2000,
2001, this whole little era right then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got like the internet is in its
like infancy essentially, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Overgrow had just began in 98.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there really wasn't any internet fame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these things that have become super
famous and like Holy grails and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: people trying to figure out stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, most of the stories that I believe
that I've heard about this stuff comes
[SPEAKER_03]: from that era because that was when there
was nobody gave a shit in the sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was no reason to bull about any
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no fame associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no, I mean, it was literally
like, there was like four people in
[SPEAKER_03]: California who had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was me Skunk Va our buddy and,
uh, uh, I see collective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see collective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, who was really close friends with
Skunk Va, you know, uh, and, and Greg and
[SPEAKER_03]: that, and he, and he ended up like,
uh, moving in with Skunk Va and that's how
[SPEAKER_03]: he got the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was literally like four of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so not very big and it's not back then
you had enormous rooms or anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really wasn't very much of it even
being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're blowing it up with the four lighter
essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly, mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight, six lighters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys are swinging hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 lighters or whatever, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, you know, and so,
uh, so just to keep it back on the super
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk tip, um, you know, uh, obviously
it's been quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but here, here's what I know for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was, uh, I never ever heard it
called anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But super skunk, um, you know,
obviously we've had some debate amongst
[SPEAKER_03]: friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole different thing we can get
into later about whatever, about some
[SPEAKER_03]: different, different names and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it may not be the exact same
thing through different crews or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as, as far as my little group
goes, um, that's what it was always called
[SPEAKER_03]: straight super skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so buddy from Staten Island,
okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would love like when we'd have trimmers
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could pull side branches of that thing
and you would hold it up to the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the picture in the catalog of the 90 seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like a dead ringer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would, you could find buds on the
plants that like match that look exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very, very uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: I witnessed him dozens of times over
multiple crops, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cause he was just so cool because
it's like exactly like the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the catalog, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he could show you, Hey, this really is
super stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're buying, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, uh, you know, in a lot of ways,
you know, it was a sketchy plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that was, you know, that was the very
beginning of the two 15 era.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it wasn't really, you know,
two 15 had like multiple eras,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The first five or two 15, like the cops,
the courts, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still pretty much underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were still getting fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: People hadn't grown to like, let's have a
greenhouse outside my back door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brilling, uh, indoor was still sketchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was still not the jam, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, so the super skunk, you know,
the last two or three weeks, it literally
[SPEAKER_03]: people joke about carbon filter killer,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the only strain I've ever grown
that, um, absolutely defeated every
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity I ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know any other way to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of burn it would give me,
like I would pull up with two weeks to go
[SPEAKER_03]: in front of my house in summer and it
would smell like a dead skunk in my
[SPEAKER_03]: driveway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the feeling, not with scumps,
but yeah, every direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, back then you're just
like, Oh my God, you know, that is nerve
[SPEAKER_03]: wracking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at which I had, obviously people
know on this, on this thing, what
[SPEAKER_03]: scrubbers are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a, a CO2 scrubber with a fan
scrubbing the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, uh, or a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, not CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a carbon filter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so that's scrubbing the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had a carbon filter on the
exhaust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had one of those huge UV on air
double, uh, um, you know, uh, ozone
[SPEAKER_03]: generators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even did the recommended 25 or 30 feet of
tubing before it went out the building to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure it had time to mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it still smelled like I was
slaughtering skunks in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's kind of how it was,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, it was trippy in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, it, it was, it was,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when it looked dense, it was still,
it's still weighed light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things where like you, you know,
you put a nug on there and you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is going to be impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, Oh, no, it's hollow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it make hollow weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like solid, but it was fluffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like almost like ice cream or
something that had a bunch of air whipped
[SPEAKER_03]: into it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, um, you know, and the turf,
the weird thing about the turf is that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was super volatile in my opinion,
like really stink until the last bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's done for about a month or
five weeks after you cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you let super skunk go too long in your
jar or whatever, it would eventually kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of smelling semi to generic Greenberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could crack a jar in the other room and
someone would walk in and ask me what was
[SPEAKER_03]: going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you would have to like crunch the
shit out of it and deeply smell to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a whiff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But fresh it reeked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, and, you know, it was kind
of hard to trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it could be sparse, you know,
when it didn't, uh, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: for most people, um, the probably the
easiest way to think about it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, real old school sour has a
lot of similarities to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so when sour doesn't want to
come out the right way, it's a bitch to
[SPEAKER_03]: trim, you know, like people lose people
start, you know, your, your, your crew
[SPEAKER_03]: gets disheartened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to trim diesel, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I posted some stuff for you the other
night, uh, that I sent you where like my
[SPEAKER_03]: old sour diesel cutting, it looks like
those tops, those colas, they really be
[SPEAKER_03]: those same super skunk tops that skunk va
posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really see the similarity in it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the other thing that, that,
uh, so it had unbelievable turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when people talk about RKS turps,
or whatever else, it was the terpiest,
[SPEAKER_03]: skunkiest, rankest thing imaginable,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it really was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, you know, it also,
you know, uh, it also harmed like a
[SPEAKER_03]: motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's like really the first thing
I ever heard about mass super,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I first started getting into the
scene and learning the history and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that shit was a her bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a her bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could harm, um, you know, we would pull
it about eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you would, um, you know,
you would try to take it longer because
[SPEAKER_03]: you think maybe it needed to be done more
and then would harm for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the other thing is, and this is kind
of weird about it is that it harmed early
[SPEAKER_03]: too, because well, as a breeder,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pull, if you, let's say you pull
the super skunk at 58 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you find tiger striped beans in it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When were those beans made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're early on, probably
primordial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to be early on because it takes a
good four to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To mature it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To like fully mature and get that dark
tiger striping that looks all healthy and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you pull a strain at 58 days just
by the law of how beans grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had the pot, you know, it's something bad
bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad had to happen in three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that actually, that in my opinion,
you know, and there's a certain amount of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we can get to opinions about it,
but that factor created a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: weed that we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the crazy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craziest part about all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through live herms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, in the, in the, uh,
you know, uh, the, the buddy from Staten
[SPEAKER_03]: Island, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was not very into sharing.
Yeah.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, uh, you know, when I got,
when I got the dog, I had to promise that
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't give it out, you know,
which I didn't for forever, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would have like, we would have like
really good friends of ours that would,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, beg me for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be like, you know, who you have to
talk to, get him to call me and say that
[SPEAKER_03]: you can have it and I'll take cuts for you
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, like, I'm not breaking my
word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like, we're all good friends and
he's going to know you have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that makes me look like an
asshole, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, you know, issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, well, this is the,
you know, this is what I had to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he wasn't as strict about the skunk,
but he kind of felt the same way,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, me, like I try to be as
like, as etiquette as possible with cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even like to pressure people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they have their own vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their own energy about why they come
to you or not, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, so what sucks about that
is that we didn't spread it very far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we weren't on forums or anything like
that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Staten Island buddy is not weasel
clock glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, he's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm not paying very much attention to
the words at the bottom of the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as anything, maybe Matt can say it or
repeat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something, but yeah, he's totally not,
it's totally not him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, uh, you know, so the fact,
there are two things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is obviously back then most people are
growing for profit, you know, on some
[SPEAKER_03]: level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so having a cut that reeks the high
heaven and scares your neighbors and herms
[SPEAKER_03]: on you, uh, you know, it made it dicey on
people holding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, we never, you know,
skunk va, myself, you know, our buddy,
[SPEAKER_03]: we never really spread it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't trading.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't active on the forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we weren't swapping cuts out
right and left and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, uh, that's a,
you know, that's a different discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you know, like every time my
opinion is, is like every single time a
[SPEAKER_03]: famous named cut happened, like purple
craze with Urkel and GDP, the sour,
[SPEAKER_03]: the cush is whatever a whole bunch of
amazing diversity just goes to shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people want to fill their room or
their greenhouse or their whatever with
[SPEAKER_03]: something that some guy is going to come
and snap it from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want the, the ship is going to sell
up for the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even amongst most of my close friends,
I've always had a bitch of a time getting
[SPEAKER_03]: people to back things up for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People want one or two plants that they're
currently doing for production and they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't hold onto a bunch of stuff that
they're doing for safekeeping or heads or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it wasn't that easy for me to get
it to be backed up anywhere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, uh, you know, when it comes to,
you know, production and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: some broker finding seeds is fucking doom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so like, Hey, do you want to grow this
thing that could potentially lightly or
[SPEAKER_03]: heavily seed your room?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not, not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, you know, I mean,
uh, so we all grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to boot someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to, but he was being a
jackass and being real rude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Oh, I have no, I, I wasn't even paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's kind of the start of the,
of the Cali super skunk, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: thing it stayed with our little crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, and, um, you know,
the Massachusetts side of things and Greg
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Masonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm being real fucking serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're being fucking disrespectful as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep it up, knock it the fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been real fucking cool to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, what happened with chem
dog in Massachusetts, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: who, when, how he shared what with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, as far as the, as far as the
actual super skunk cut goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but it's one of those things
where like, you know, uh, nobody wanted it
[SPEAKER_03]: until it became sort of this legendary
famous thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody started poking around,
trying to figure out who might've kept it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, Staten Island and I, um,
we had this thing where like two of our
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite strains were obviously the super
skunk and the chem dog, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the super skunk had the, the lime
green and the frost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I mean, you know, from the chem,
you know, from dog, dog isn't particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not super frosty compared to strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's darker cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it cannibalizes its own leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't even always taste great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes it can taste amazing
and I love the flavor, but like I could
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it all year long and only two crops
out of five be happy with its flavor at
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and why exactly, um,
why, why exactly that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had this idea, um, and this is long
before, you know, I mean, there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: real American seed companies or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were, we were doing a bunch of
breeding, but we were doing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding that was literally for our taste
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was not for public consumption at
best.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was going to be grown by us and spread
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we created this, we created this
thing over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Staten Island started it and I came on
and helped, uh, and you know, we did some
[SPEAKER_03]: work on it together, uh, that we
eventually called the super dog,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, which is in the can of Bible,
the second one, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that was my first, that was my
first experience with kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, really finding a strain that I wanted
to hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right there, even though I got along
quite well with, with Jason who wrote it,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, and I gave him a bunch of accurate
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that got twisted and turned into
some of his entries about the dog and the
[SPEAKER_03]: chem dog and the super and all that type
of stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So be that as it may, what we were trying
to do is we were trying to combine the
[SPEAKER_03]: Terps and the look of super skunk with the
potency and some of the density and some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the niceness of the dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like a, you know, and so,
um, you know, and strangely, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is another thing of why I think
maybe it disappeared is we talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: this recently too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to believe that the skunk and the
herm is related.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I can't say for certain,
but I think it might be a linked trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of, uh, um, evidence for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and as you know, um,
you know, there's, there's very few traits
[SPEAKER_03]: that people breeding have, you know,
more prejudice against than, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: banana, banana sacks with herm in them,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think inadvertently, uh,
people bred away from the skunk without
[SPEAKER_03]: realizing it because, you know,
you breed some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hermy mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, Oh God, that's a hermy mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get, you know, I'm not going
to breed towards that side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the idea that you could have a linked
trait where you have a very desirable
[SPEAKER_03]: trait and a not so desirable trait,
uh, together, you know, the biggest reader
[SPEAKER_00]: pain in the ass ever is a link trait with
undesirable traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, Oh, all the potency comes in
these low yielding ones that suck,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, all these huge donkey dicks and
like have the structure is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all bland, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, uh, the problem is,
is that, you know, you have a situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, it's kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, like I told you about with
the Trinity, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the Trinity didn't spread very far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we lost it and I kept trying
to get it back, um, people would give me
[SPEAKER_03]: fakes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not because they were dicks most of
the time, but because they never had it
[SPEAKER_03]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they got it from someone,
they didn't, they had no way of knowing
[SPEAKER_03]: that it wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so then I would have to be the
bearer of bad news, you know, and be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, this isn't it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people hate the bearer of bad news.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of what's happened with
this super skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that there's obviously this desire in
the community to have these, these
[SPEAKER_03]: roadkill turps come back, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone who finds super skunk has a
current seed company and is making seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: to sold to the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one ever shows up to events with a
couple jars of fresh skunk and lets the
[SPEAKER_03]: proof be in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: They advertise the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're breeding with the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy my seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the amazing turps in the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they get kinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, so you don't know, you don't know
if, if they're lying because I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever, or they just have no,
they just never had it in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to know that, to know what skunk
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What actual, to what the actual skunk cut
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, by the early to mid
2000s, it had been dropped enough that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, various people had lost it
through, you know, lots of the same
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons that everybody loses cuts,
fires, busts, accidents, breakups,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people not returning it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had backed up with a couple people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They refused to give it back to me at one
point and then lost it in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had some stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I lost it and we've been, you know,
we've been hunting it ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I mean, we're both
obviously friends with Skunk Va.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these new school super skunk finds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what are you going to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: They just end up, they end up not looking,
I mean, what's awesome is that he's got
[SPEAKER_03]: these, he's got these, you know,
these pictures, these Polaroids that are
[SPEAKER_03]: undisputable proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the cut I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so big that he has those pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're buddies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got it from, you know, it came from the
same place.
[SPEAKER_03]: The story was the same thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's, it's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you have all these other
shorter squatter, Afghan, all these other
[SPEAKER_03]: different looking, you know, super skunk
cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other part of it too,
is that you have people that like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, so this guy had the super skunk at
once, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then as soon as that dude verifies,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then all of a sudden, okay,
we have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can trade bait it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can get spread out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this person has the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the problem, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I mean, before everybody
who's listening, holy shit, we're up to
[SPEAKER_03]: 242 people on this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the super skunk was not a perfect cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like it wasn't, in my opinion,
it wasn't the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it have crazy rare skunk turps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had that fades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it enjoyable to smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it held a candle to the dog,
the D, some of the cushions, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: modern cuts right now that we would
consider to be elite, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would consider it to have moderate
potency at best.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it wasn't, you know,
I mean, you know, various cuts have
[SPEAKER_03]: various qualities and, and, and other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and so it didn't check all
the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a great cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it worth having?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a pain in the ass to grow at times?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in your room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about, but, you know, in,
you know, I mean, in, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean, obviously, you know,
all of chem dogs early breedings were all
[SPEAKER_03]: accidental.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as far as we know, that's the
correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was, well, I mean, the thing is
that nobody was reversing back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus fucking Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, no, it was making femseeds back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you only, you know, so,
you know, the only way you're crossing two
[SPEAKER_03]: female cuts is accidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and those accidents,
you know, they led to some of the best
[SPEAKER_03]: weed ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in many people's opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I mean, that's,
that's like a whole nother thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: steps, you know, maybe it steps on toes or
doesn't to talk about all those kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: theories about various things,
but I have not seen the real super skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: since I lost it, which has been,
you know, quite a while at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been hunting it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I don't think it exists,
you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always the possibility there are
still pockets in America where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people aren't really connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not dialed in to like the scene,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously, just like we know,
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to jump on a European trip,
everybody thought the A52 was lost for
[SPEAKER_03]: well over a decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody could find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Karma found a guy that was
holding onto this cut for Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville told him not to tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the A52.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Karma wasn't even sure what he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to give it to Yosemite who he
grew with Neville forever to grow it out
[SPEAKER_03]: and confirm it was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's possible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we are all desperately hoping
that happens too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible that that could exist
because the A5 was lost for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was a short period of time that
it was lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it got lost in the
Switzerland raids when they shut down
[SPEAKER_03]: Shanti and those different things and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got lost in Holland during the bust
eras.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was lost for, you know,
10, 12, 14 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that until it just popped
up within the last few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now losing friends fast over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's fucking arguing over it real
fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it's cool that people are
still fighting over over cannabis made in
[SPEAKER_03]: the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: To how good it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's also not only as a
testament to how good it is, but like
[SPEAKER_03]: people want to make money off it,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got rare and you've got rare
access and you can bring some things,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you're a breeder who operates in
the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got something nobody else
does and you can hype it and it's worthy
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can, you know, I mean,
that's what all these super scunt people
[SPEAKER_03]: are trying to do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to make a bunch of money
before people realize they don't have what
[SPEAKER_03]: they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people want to sell
seeds or pass cuts or do this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a good, at least a minimum
four months, three months before you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get any kind of pushback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other problem is that I've
noticed when people either invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: buying that cut or they've invested
emotionally in that cut at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they think they've got a really rare
cut that's going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring some kind of value to their life,
however they see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're now in that mindset where this
is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not yet, I don't have whatever
agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was saying with the Trinity,
people would get butthurt at me sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: when I would be like politely,
it's not it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would go full thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't know what I traded to get
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And da da da da da da.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be like, well, you know,
I'm sorry about all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have nothing to do with any of
that, but yeah, remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still not it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just isn't it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it's gotten to a point
where there's a narrow group of people who
[SPEAKER_03]: had super skunk it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them had longer relationships
with it than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of them are a little bit
better at identifying than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without naming names or stepping on toes
or doing anything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've had issues in the past in the
community with people that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: are, you know, well thought of or
respected that verify.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once it's verified, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's all that's all she wrote.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's verified, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I, you know,
hit up, you know, skunk bar or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be like, what about that verified
cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It absolutely isn't it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they ever had it,
if they think that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, like if he tells me,
if he hits me up and he tells me,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I found it, I'm gonna get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he's I, I tend to think him above
everyone else is going to know that cut
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really intimately being that it
came from his mentor and he worked with it
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, the fact the fact
remains is that him, our buddy and myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: we cropped it quite a bit for three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do crop after crop after crop for that
a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You run anything for a number of years as
your as your main squeeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you learn a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: When my buddy and I were, I mean,
that's the thing too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've talked about this
before is that since we bred with it a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch, I got to see, you know,
that's one of the things that I really
[SPEAKER_03]: respect about, you know, say like CSI or
archive who I see on here, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: where there's only so many breeders out
there right now that actually test their
[SPEAKER_03]: own gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't test your own gear,
you don't really know what, you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really know what traits your clones pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to see it firsthand
ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see what, how they breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they breed clean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they breed a mess?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they throw consistent phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they, you know, growing a bunch of,
growing a bunch of, oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truth band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's asking about truth band.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's, that's a whole different
subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but yeah, you know, but so we grew,
you know, buddy from Staten Island and
[SPEAKER_03]: myself, we grew out hundreds of,
you know, dog and, and skunk and other
[SPEAKER_03]: various skunk hybrids, you know,
and, and we saw what it passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you see what it throws out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of the, the various like semi
proven, semi unproven theories I have
[SPEAKER_03]: about certain things we talked about a
bunch are just on my observation of like
[SPEAKER_03]: not very many people like had both
parents.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gunkva, my buddy, myself, were like
literally in like a handful of people that
[SPEAKER_03]: probably had both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And were familiar with both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I mean, you know,
the, the skunk definitely seemed to be
[SPEAKER_03]: connected to herms.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, you know, when we were doing the,
the super dog stuff, if we bred away from
[SPEAKER_03]: the herms, we bred away from some of the
stuff we liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the trick was to try to find like
a minimal or acceptable amount of herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like say take the Chem D for instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem D herms like crazy at times.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it gets a little test, especially in
depth, you know, not as much as indoor,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in depth, certainly, or if it gets a
little stressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not live pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's not, it's sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It throws bananas, but there's not really
live pollen in those bananas, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you're looking for, you're looking
for, you know, one throws herms and has
[SPEAKER_03]: the stink, but doesn't have the danger
inherent in, in all that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a long and expensive breeding
project because back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously herb went for a lot more and it
was a lot riskier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anytime you dedicated rooms or areas to
constant breeding, that could have been
[SPEAKER_03]: just some kind of production run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're not even selling the
beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just for you and your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but, but you know, we had,
we always had dual stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we always had this goal of trying to
like, you know, improve the gene pool a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit, you know, create more weed
that we liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now it's like most, most people's
breeding is like, take two famous things
[SPEAKER_03]: that people want, mash them together and
then sell the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it's like, we were like,
okay, like we, we liked the skunk smell
[SPEAKER_03]: and we liked the color and we liked the,
the, you know, the quickness and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we marry that to the dog's potency and
feeling and warm, happy buzz and all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there some hybrid that we can create
that marries those two things together?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's obviously the classic way to
breed is you look at two different things
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're like, I want traits from this
and traits from this to end up in its
[SPEAKER_03]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so that's, that's really the
gig.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it, you know, sadly,
it seems like a bunch of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: got passed, it got passed around in
Massachusetts quite a bit more,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it seems like from what we've been
able to determine that it, maybe it,
[SPEAKER_03]: the actual cut itself wasn't passed around
nearly as much as people think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in one, maybe bag seed, maybe
something different got passed out and it
[SPEAKER_03]: got called super skunk and it was from
said dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course it's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're off to the races and then
that thing gets spread around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the more, you know, I mean,
we, we talked about this before too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like, you know, rez calling his
fucking line, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because anytime a named cut and then makes
a fucking line out of it, finding the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual named cut, once there's a whole
bunch of, of, you know, yeah, other stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: out there that has the same name is
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became damn near impossible in some
cases with that, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and so I mean, you know,
the, I think the super skunk has a semi
[SPEAKER_03]: there's obviously there's some pretty
famous people in the weed community that
[SPEAKER_03]: had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that ends like some gravitas to the
fact that it was killer and then they was
[SPEAKER_03]: killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it comes from this 90s historical
era, obviously.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and then on top of that,
it probably is in a bunch of other things
[SPEAKER_03]: that people don't realize.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody knows what a rank skunk
smells like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in America for the most part is
probably in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once, you know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a really distinctive turf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't, it doesn't, you know,
I mean, some people on here know some
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't, but I got lucky enough and I
cracked them and what became known as the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo P, you know, and what's interesting
about that cut is that like, if that cut
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't exist, there's no, no other line
that I know of that has those turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like those turps are in cannabis,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're obviously in cannabis,
but it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: The modern cannabis and anything you find
that ends up smelling like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you discover it was descended from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, you know, the,
the skunk nose, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: really only pops out here and there in its
descendants.
[SPEAKER_03]: On occasion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and so it just doesn't even
it, it, nobody's found it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's, nobody's made the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's found the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's been able to produce seed lines
or cuttings anytime, because if they did,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would be announced.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would be, it's, they would be at
conventions or, you know, Emerald Cup or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever with jars and they would be,
you know, it's a lost turp that people
[SPEAKER_03]: want back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who can capture that, that thiol
turp into a seed line that reliably
[SPEAKER_00]: produces it and, and let it stay in the
bud form is, is going to master it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, so it's obviously a lot of
constituents of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, trying to get something that
really hangs with that smell past flower
[SPEAKER_00]: is very, very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you know, and so everybody,
it's got universal recognition of what it
[SPEAKER_03]: should smell like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole bunch of fake cuts that
people try to pretend smell like it,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really did smell like it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with it, there's no faking the
funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you have skunk oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rub it on a jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all, and all that, and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's like the scientific
method, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if somebody can't grow it and produce
the same smell, it's not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like you had to do a bomber job
of growing it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, you know, obviously in
the nineties, we've all gotten quite a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: better at gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Older, you get more experienced.
[SPEAKER_03]: You learn more.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's way cooler products that make your
life easier, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, we used to mix soil in a
fucking cement mixer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: From raw amendments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't all these biological amendments.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't all these like, you know,
inoculants and booze and teas and this and
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there is now, it was like,
it was like GH and, you know, earth juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the, even just the stuff that
you could get and like you were,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you were just happy that the store
carried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty limited compared to now,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that turp just, it just existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's saying about the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not from the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpenbird, think about that question for
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Mendo perps from the PNW?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it's cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any question, whoever asked that,
any question is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's, Turpenbird's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really down to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like most, that's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just so, you know, like,
you know, Matt and I are going to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast pretty soon here and chat about
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really what it boils down to for me is
like, without the, I don't really give a
[SPEAKER_03]: shit about fame or rep or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our history in the cannabis
community is oral.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, passed down from people to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are people that have heard the
real deal and have verified and cross
[SPEAKER_03]: verified type stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it can be really hard for people to
come along later or don't have personal
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have a personal connection to
something, I mean, bullshit spreads like
[SPEAKER_03]: wildfire at times, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And certain people have vested interests
in spreading bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, counteracting that with
truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so, but yeah, you know,
it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, it's an underground, it was an
underground illegal venture and lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: little individual groups you know,
like passing on knowledge to each other,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just so happens that, you know,
like the Grateful Dead and the kids that
[SPEAKER_03]: followed the Grateful Dead, that was
probably like the greatest open air weed
[SPEAKER_03]: market in American history at a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after them, after Jerry died,
started growing weed because it kept the
[SPEAKER_03]: lifestyle going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a while now, it's not true
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're just a segment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for a minute, you know, in the 90s,
and mid 2000s, like almost all the best
[SPEAKER_03]: and most famous cuts came from some hippie
or another, some crew, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: some related group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're only so far removed from all
those people because it's a small world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it, you know, most of this
stuff, I just got lucky in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean, you have no idea what's
going to be famous or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that we're doing, like, you know,
the dog didn't get famous until Skunk Va
[SPEAKER_03]: decided to get on forums and start
chatting about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew who, you know, except for on
the East.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew who Chem Dog was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew who Peabod was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew any of these people's names or
what they were involved with or anything
[SPEAKER_03]: else, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so it's like, you know,
all this stuff kind of happens after the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you're just like,
you're just kids.
