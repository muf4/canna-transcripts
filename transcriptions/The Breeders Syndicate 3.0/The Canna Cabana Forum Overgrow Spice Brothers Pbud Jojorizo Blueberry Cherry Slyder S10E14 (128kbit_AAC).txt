[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_03]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_03]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_03]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_03]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Matthew, here with my co-host
Thousandfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, we have a really, really special
show, special to me, special to all the
[SPEAKER_03]: forum members of the community from back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have everyone from the Kana Cabana that
made that place special, that built it up,
[SPEAKER_03]: and each one of these guys really brought
something special to cannabis other than
[SPEAKER_03]: just the Cabana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each has their own unique stories,
how they came to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm honored.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for doing this with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means a shitload to me as someone who
grew up looking up to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, Thousand, take it away,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very, very much like a guest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very remote from all of you,
and especially remote from that time in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also just very grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we could kick it off with a
little icebreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we do a roundtable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of you tell us, how did you get
into the forums to begin with as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your growing or journey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can start with D-Man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, I'm D-Man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody knows me and knows the
forums.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I hit the forums like 1997 when
Overgrow was still, I think it was called
[SPEAKER_08]: The Edge back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a wild ride that was when you first
get on the internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the coolest place ever,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: All these other people.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when I just really started growing
weed indoors at that time, 1997,
[SPEAKER_08]: 1998.
[SPEAKER_08]: Finding that, dude, people were sharing
genetics all over the place.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, wow, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I got started, hanging out
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty rowdy place at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was definitely cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other like-minded people around,
and didn't know that existed, especially
[SPEAKER_08]: on the internet, which was all really new.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least to me, I knew I'd be around for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same here, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did it mean to interrupt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Darren, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm done, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I discovered it basically after,
I guess, my dad gave me a hand-me-down
[SPEAKER_02]: computer around 1994 or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't really discover the online cannabis
community until closer to 19... Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: help me out here, Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did we, when were we, and Howie?
[SPEAKER_08]: Late 90s, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was late 90s.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pre-911 version.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure, like a few years before 911.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I taught myself to grow all up
before that without the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go source underground books from
shady little bookstores here and there,
[SPEAKER_02]: and finally piece together how hydroponics
might actually work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I didn't have enough sense to
go to the library, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then discovering the forums,
that was like, oh, this was everything I
[SPEAKER_02]: needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I can't believe I didn't have this
trellis netting on my plants to hold them
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's a picture of what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh, boy, you know,
these forums are gonna be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were, still are, but they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right now, sir, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, late 80s, I moved to Colorado and
could not find good pot here on my own.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks to my great wife, I was able to
start growing on my own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Found the internet by looking for seeds.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't too long, you know, after the late
90s, I started really looking for seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I came across overgrown in the cannabis
world and actually came across D-Man then
[SPEAKER_05]: and became like his primary beta tester.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, I was beta testing
for Mota Rebel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had a great time, because the genetics
were coming to me from them and a few
[SPEAKER_05]: other folks up in Canada on the west side
from where D-Man is were sending me
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of became, weirdly, I'm a very
small scale grower, as most people who get
[SPEAKER_05]: to know me know, but I ended up at one
point holding genetics and supplying
[SPEAKER_05]: clones to, I don't know how many people,
Steve, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Between you and me, we sell stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere in the world possible,
we tried to get stuff there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had the hardest trouble,
I think, with Darren.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Darren's a troublemaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes naturally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, packages made it to Hungary with
clones, no problem, but couldn't get them
[SPEAKER_05]: past Canada's security.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada's hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, still it's hard to get clones over
that border.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I don't know how but Cushy Man,
that guy can get clones over the border.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: He does it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a fucking secret, but he does it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll tell you, just to jump in here,
of all the elite clones that you guys have
[SPEAKER_08]: heard about in the U.S., they went through
these two guys' hands before they went to
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Steve and Howie, dude, everything
went through them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of weird because,
you know, we're older than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had to start out with seed
because we definitely didn't have clone
[SPEAKER_02]: connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we finally discovered the
online community, it just opened up
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're just the kid in the candy
store.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I bought my first seeds from Mark
Emery way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sent me strains I didn't order,
but that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember the way I met you,
Steve, we were, you know, we were talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about, you know, how nice it would be if
we each had different, different bud to
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing we knew, we were trading
through the mail, you know, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: samples to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you became my primary source for who I
want to try to grow that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is I think a lot of these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much built to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a bunch of new ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that whole new batch I got in
most of those just flopped, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, any cookie stuff now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am running some some cookie strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the garlic cookies, which I
really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a bunch of other new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got this modified grapes, which I haven't
thrown out, but how he has.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got that you can see this tiny little
itsy bitsy bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go get a bigger bud, but that's what
I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking this little modified grapes right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the size of a grape.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually actually this is some sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the buds, the buds on the modified
grapes are very reminiscent of the ice
[SPEAKER_05]: cream cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look a lot like the ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you smell them, you can tell
they're definitely two different,
[SPEAKER_05]: different beasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just they look almost exactly alike
growing and could be twins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from modern genetics, let's talk
about what you guys were first seeing when
[SPEAKER_03]: you when you hit the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, of course, a lot of strains didn't
have names at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you started seeing that,
like Darren, what do you what did you see?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, it was like, you know, back then,
it was the sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: See me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back then, a dude, it was like,
you know, the White Widows, a secret Coke
[SPEAKER_08]: recipe, White Widows, a lot of,
you know, Blueberry, not and not just DJ
[SPEAKER_08]: shorts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's real blueberry, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, dude, seriously, the best blueberry
and not enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: The DJ or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: But was that saver math is blueberry,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that's shit wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was some really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, dude, for for me, it was like,
I never really bought, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: breeder seeds, like really at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I found Seabay through Cannabis World,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where I spent my money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, there was like and some of those
guys, you know, like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Never heard of before, like most of them,
you know, just, oh, we apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, some of the best genetics ever came
out of there for cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you mentioned Motor Rebel,
one of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Motor Rebel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, dude, Joey Weed, you know,
like that's where I got my start.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was the three seed or the three
seeds of classic clone company.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually forget who that was.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, dude, you know, Katsu's Bluebird,
his collection, like that dude just like
[SPEAKER_08]: rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just bought everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he did a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, dude, if I sold my own seeds at
Seabay, and that would be the only way I
[SPEAKER_08]: bought seeds was some serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just instead of taking cash from
RC, I would just say send me seeds that he
[SPEAKER_08]: had on the board.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Sangramath or Blueberry is
literally the only two breeder seeds I
[SPEAKER_08]: ever bought.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything else was Seabay and traded
straight up freebies, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was what it was great back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like nobody really cared about money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like even Seabay, dude, like nothing other
than, you know, Dutch flowers stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing went over for like 25,
30 bucks a pack.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that was what made the forums fun for
me, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like everybody wanted to talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody was willing to share.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we all had our little knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, I had all kinds of outdoor
experience before I had the indoor
[SPEAKER_08]: experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like to hang out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's like Steve said,
it was like a kid in the cane store.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people were awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was trolls.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the most part, the first few
years, it was like, this is cool,
[SPEAKER_08]: dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you had no idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all over the world, like Australia,
New Zealand, like, you know, Fiji,
[SPEAKER_08]: like growers from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, dude, you could literally ship
clones and seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that was super easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: But after 9-11, then everything just
slammed shut.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, back in the day, you could get a
priority mail package in two days,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the clones would still be alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of stuff are you seeing,
Skitty?
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of stuff are you seeing when you
first got online?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I got any clones in the mail,
I did buy some seeds and had some good
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the blue bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Flo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the Flo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like an idiot, I didn't keep that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I had the DJ Short Flo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a DJ Short Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also had a blueberry that someone
else had given me, which could have just
[SPEAKER_02]: been a mirror image of the DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was just real, wonderful blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought those legendary packs of slider
from SagerMatha and grew those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I found the cherry slider.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will regain that one day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smoked it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Never grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what else did I... Oh,
my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bog strains, if you remember Bog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: His Boggle gum and... Sour Bubble?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't think I had necessarily
think I had the Sour Bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may...
[SPEAKER_02]: I very well may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when I was down in New Orleans at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And... Did he have Bog Bubble at the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: He had something called, remember,
Boggle gum.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, that was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bog's Boggle gum.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, that was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I had the THC's Boggle gum or
excuse me, THC's Bubble gum as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had THC's Chocolate Chunk,
which I didn't really find any chocolate
[SPEAKER_02]: or any chunk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just one of those hit and miss sort
of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you do the ChocoDiesel too,
skinny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was way down the road after
Santa Smoke had his trivia contest late
[SPEAKER_02]: one night at Cannabis World and gave out
the packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the ChocoDiesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the original ChocoDiesel guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made one much later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people would ask me if I was the
ChocoDiesel guy from Gorilla Glow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that came before me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are two phenos out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another Cannabis World alumni
who's at the Cabana now, Knucklehead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knucklehead found a separate pheno from
what mine was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's Knucklehead pheno and then
there is the Skitty pheno.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure mine was a bit more
distributed than the Knucklehead.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you see during those first years?
[SPEAKER_03]: What strains were you running into?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course, I ran into D-Man,
so I was beta testing a whole lot of his
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with Mota.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I saw a lot of those strains,
but I ran into just different groups of
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had lots of very kind people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had strains from Cabbage Man,
1969.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had strains from Stash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was seeing a lot of Aloha White Widow
crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were seeing a lot of Black Widow G-13
crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of G-13 Gorilla Arm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day when we originally started
here in Colorado, I also was able to
[SPEAKER_05]: source some Romulan and some of the
Colorado Peabud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, thinking about it,
I really wish I knew how to clone and keep
[SPEAKER_05]: plants back then because there were some
real cherry plants back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also saw a tremendous amount of Durban
in Colorado in the late 80s, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a pleasure to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We even ended up getting our own cut
somehow, rather.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado has its own Durban cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure who that's care of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Stacy Muir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: He might have been instrumental in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another real nice guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I was privy to helping these other
two gentlemen run an auction for a
[SPEAKER_05]: gentleman in Australia named Rod Wall back
in the day to help him get out of some
[SPEAKER_05]: troubles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of the middleman for I don't
know how many thousands of seeds that
[SPEAKER_05]: different members across the different
forms donated to us so we could have an
[SPEAKER_05]: auction and send him some money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even today in my seed collection,
I still hold some things that everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: gave me extras so I would have for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still holding seeds from back in the
day from that auction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to find something to do with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they in a fridge?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did it right, Ro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned someone from Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that later to be D-Man's buddy or a
different person from that region?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we first got on Cannabis World,
I got back on OG in I think it was 99,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I didn't move over to Cannabis World
till 2000.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where D and I started really
connecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back then, we had a grip of folks who were
from all over the world growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them were there for having
stairway for seeds to get from Seabed.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us, we all have things in common.
[SPEAKER_05]: You meet people different ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had people from all over trading
us stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had guys in England.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the original UK Cheese came to
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that by Vision?
[SPEAKER_05]: From Vision.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we all first saw pictures of it,
we saw pictures of this white plant
[SPEAKER_05]: sitting out in somebody's backyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw it in England.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, wow, what the heck is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that covered in mold?
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember that very photo.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was wild.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vision made sure that a group of us got
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: God rest his soul, Buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the early days, Buckwheat was heavily
involved with us in making sure that a
[SPEAKER_05]: large number of members got a variety of
clones that we were being sent from Canada
[SPEAKER_05]: through Vision creator and Thunder Monkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: He watches sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Being in Canada, Vision, it was easy for
Vision to get me the UK Cheese.
[SPEAKER_08]: One goes to the next.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back then, that was pretty sure pre-911.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right around there, it was still easy to
get stuff across.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, Howie, he was the repository
for all the clones, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything went through him and it went to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had two lights to grow my plants under.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I had a front room with a bunch of
T5s.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't use it anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to Skitty, I don't have to worry
about moms anymore, which is great for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: At one point, I was holding 26 to 35 moms
at any given time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a whole group, including Kirby,
who knew that if they needed clones,
[SPEAKER_05]: they would just call me and come over and
I would just turn my back.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would just go in my room and make
what they needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the holder of the strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called easy maintenance too,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy maintenance for the mom.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let other people come over and keep it
firm back for her.
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked out fine for me at the time to
be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I had people passing through
staying with me like Skitty stayed with me
[SPEAKER_05]: when he moved out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the doc to stay here for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorter, God rest his soul, when he first
moved to Colorado, he stayed with me for a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a lot of people come and go and a
lot of good people come and pass genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorter was another one who bred genetics
in the backyard secretly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that anybody else thought was
wrong was worthy he would try to breed F2s
[SPEAKER_05]: of.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have in my repository some of his
F2s from a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of those are almost all Aloha White
Widow crosses.
That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that through Jojo's work that he was
doing F2s of or someone else's like NCG?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he was doing someone else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget who originally put out the Aloha
White Widow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorter had a lot of mental health issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was super obsessive, compulsive,
and had paranoia.
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, that strain helped him
get through his day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He tried crossing it to all different
kinds of things to see if he could get a
[SPEAKER_05]: better, more vigorous plant that would
help him.
[SPEAKER_05]: In turn, he was one of those people who
posted up on Cannabis World only minorly,
[SPEAKER_05]: but all of his posts were like,
oh, I just made these crosses and these
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses if anybody wants them.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was constantly sending out seeds to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still making the rounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still come across a few people I know
who still grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had an Aloha White Widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crystal locomotive?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it might have been my train wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that's the crystal locomotive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think he had that cross and I
think he passed that around a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, everybody was trying to do their
part to make sure everyone in the
[SPEAKER_05]: community had what they needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: His biggest, most famous one to this day,
a lot of people don't know, is the Grape
[SPEAKER_03]: Stomper clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came via Jojo and it was renamed and
stuff, but that's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool to still see it moving
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jojo had some great strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had never, he came out with a candy
haze and other haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought Blowfish was Dutch Flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a lot with Dutch Flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been able to unravel it,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did Blowfish.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did Blowfish F2s, but he also sold
seeds to RC that I think were sold as
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch Flowers, but I don't even know who
Dutch Flowers was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, dude, you're on the right track
there, Matt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly think that Dutch Flowers was
RC.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Reeferman told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that he was RC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't confirm that, but that's my hunch,
dude, because, you know, he used to deal
[SPEAKER_08]: with RC a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, we're getting paid and
stuff with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their writing styles were very similar,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had some emails that were like,
wow, dude, just the way they word things,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had the best descriptions,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so speaking of Jojo, dude,
like such great strains, probably nothing
[SPEAKER_08]: went over like 30, 35 bucks, 40 bucks max.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, max, dude, like nowadays,
you know, you would just kill for that
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, it wasn't about the money
back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really wasn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all about, yeah, it was kind of
cool to, you know, get a few bucks,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, because it wasn't a lot of
money, but it was just collecting.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, you know, almost like
collecting baseball cards, really,
[SPEAKER_08]: like Kirby says, you know, people collect
seeds like baseball cards now,
[SPEAKER_08]: but back then it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ask Katsu, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got one of the biggest baseball card
collections I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you remember D-Man, remember Academy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he bought everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fastest bidder on CW there was.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was a sniper, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: What a sniper that guy was.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't win a pack from him if he
wanted it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would snipe you right to the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, after my own heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say, you know,
like, I'm really enjoying just being a fly
[SPEAKER_00]: on the wall for this conversation,
but it sounds like just such a radically
[SPEAKER_00]: different time to where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, it was so different.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, you know, I'm not going to say
there wasn't snakes, but we weren't,
[SPEAKER_08]: we weren't privy to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure like some of the guys that were
really, you know, running the hard traps
[SPEAKER_08]: and out in California that were,
you know, really facing hard time if they
[SPEAKER_08]: got caught, you know, those guys,
yeah, you could see where they were,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, a little closer to the vest.
[SPEAKER_08]: They wouldn't share as much, but it
slowly, even those guys started coming out
[SPEAKER_08]: when it seemed, you know, remember that,
uh, what was that guy, uh, with the black,
[SPEAKER_08]: the blackberry guy, so much summer blaze.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, like those guys, like, you know,
at first, dude, that guy showed some
[SPEAKER_08]: pictures blew everybody away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody had ever seen fucking weed like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he would just wouldn't say anything,
but then slowly even he would come out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but for the most part, it,
there was, it, there was no sketchiness.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one was trying to get a leg up.
[SPEAKER_08]: On anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, dude, it's like, you know,
how he said, we just wanted to make sure
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody got a taste of everything that
was going around and get it to wherever we
[SPEAKER_08]: could.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember when I first got my first
clones in the mail, I think it was towel
[SPEAKER_02]: that sent them and I got the sour diesel,
the Bubba Kush train wreck, or help me out
[SPEAKER_02]: here guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there two more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the holy grail of seven strains at
the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know about your end,
but dude, this was cats.
[SPEAKER_08]: You sent me all my gear that I had that I
was breeding with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was maybe part of the seven
strains at the Bubba Kush, East coast,
[SPEAKER_08]: sour diesel train wreck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the, uh, a 11, the genius cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think I had the chocolate diesel was
C 99 out yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the C 99 I had, uh, and that was,
I believe one eighties cuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that was the most prominent good cut
at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably still is to this day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and dude, it was so cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how cool it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: So cat shoes in the States, Southern
state, not going to say which one he
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking UPS me those clones at four 20 his
time in a Southern us state.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they arrived.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Ontario at my fucking door at four 20
the next day, rooted clones, dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: by a UPS, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we never had that look next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we never tried UPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three years later, I called them all when
heaven's stairway got busted because I
[SPEAKER_08]: figured they're coming for us.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So lost it all, but that's how easy it was
back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: And nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was like, nobody, everybody was
looking for the Holy grail, but everyone
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted to get it around, find everything,
just get as many people looking forward as
[SPEAKER_08]: possible with many strains popping
billions of seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody was from sea bay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just a wild fun time and then it
got ruined.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a real small crowd at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was, there was different people in a
group.
[SPEAKER_05]: And depending upon which segment of a
group you were in, you might get the
[SPEAKER_05]: clones before, you know, I might get them
before D would get them or before skitty
[SPEAKER_05]: would get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everybody knew I was going to give
them to skitty or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we had, we had guys like way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you know, who was sharing
genetics kind of really as secretively as
[SPEAKER_05]: possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we had, you know, barefoot who
was sending seeds to all of us behind the
[SPEAKER_05]: scenes without saying anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was good friends with, you know,
I, I feel like I made a connection with
[SPEAKER_05]: like CTG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was getting a bunch of stuff from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great breeder, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: To this day, you know, his brother.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good between good gear and his,
and his brother med kind, we get a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: our gear.
[SPEAKER_05]: From them to even today, you know,
we, we've developed relationships that
[SPEAKER_05]: are, you know, years of, of making,
I, I opened my home and had parties with,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, upwards of 30 people on four 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't always know everybody who
showed up at my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those are fun barbecues.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all had a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all made good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we met Kirby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I flew in from Canada for those
parties.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were better than the ones we had in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, and then there were the cups,
you know, out in California where we met
[SPEAKER_05]: all the guys that, you know, that we kind
of hold dearly old sog and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: also repo and CGA helps player.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been good to me too over the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just texting with Elky last night
about his Detroit red wings.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we just had, we had great people,
you know, every single one of them,
[SPEAKER_05]: Chip Baker, you know, Ed Larkus,
TC, just huge crowd of people and
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody who anybody, you know,
if something, if you, if you wanted it,
[SPEAKER_05]: all you had to do was ask, you know,
it was, it was good, good times and safe
[SPEAKER_05]: times pre, pre the COVID stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, with our group and our group that we
have going on right now, we really tended
[SPEAKER_03]: to model a lot of what your guys's parties
were about, how that all worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: clones and bring that into the modern era.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we do it some justice a
little bit, but it sounds like it was
[SPEAKER_03]: fricking amazing time to be alive,
a little jealous, but I'm, I'm,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stoked also to hear about it from your
guys's eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, was there any memorable moments
during any of those parties?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can think of where someone was,
you know, kind of wild.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at Howie's at one of those parties
and the first time I met Kirby and that
[SPEAKER_08]: was the first time he, Kirby gave me my
first job ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the first job I ever did a shot or
I think that was in like, I gotta say
[SPEAKER_08]: that's at least 10 years ago now,
like 2014 or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a really nice day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I remember that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kirby was way ahead of the pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't looked back since then,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a dab fucking hat, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I smoke more dabs than I ever do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I had to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do, I did too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got sick after a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's C O P D knocking at the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's bubble fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does something about those dabs?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, memorable for me about the
parties, of course, is, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: all the people who I've met, including
some who are no longer with us like Zoch,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, Matt and Sorter and,
you know, a nice, we still have a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our friend Bud Spleefman came to a lot of
the parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still friends with, you know,
Kirby because of the parties and Green
[SPEAKER_05]: MoFo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the funny stories about one of
the parties, the first party Kirby came
[SPEAKER_05]: to, he bought a brand new dab rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was over a $200 dab rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got one hit out of it and then he
dropped it on my concrete patio.
[SPEAKER_05]: We laugh about it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of a stinging memory and he
always joked about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He never once got upset.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Kirby, that's kind of guy Kirby
is, you know, just rolled with the
[SPEAKER_05]: punches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, didn't, didn't Kirby have a whole
dab case, like a specialized briefcase
[SPEAKER_02]: with all different folded papers?
[SPEAKER_05]: We call those trap trophies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when it became unfashionable to
use the torch, if you remember,
[SPEAKER_05]: he not only brought the case with the dab
rig, but he brought like the battery to
[SPEAKER_05]: heat everything up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he brought the whole setup.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like mobile dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had, he had quite the setup and he was
the first person I ever met who was making
[SPEAKER_05]: the giant bazooka tubes, you know,
to blow hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of a cool, cool thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so he was doing it at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I first met him, he was,
he was the dab man at scale in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh dude, dude, he was the guy who was
buying the giant tubs of fucking,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, do you take this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like he went to the supplier or something
and the suppliers like, dude, we can order
[SPEAKER_08]: that in for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like, yeah, order me as much as
you can get.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you using it for?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's a science project or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what, one of the most well-known things
with you D man is the spice brothers era.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a person named Fett.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit about how that
came to be?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually Fett was, he was in Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a wild man for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just hit it off because he was a big
indoor grower in Australia, which,
[SPEAKER_08]: which you think when you think of
Australia, you don't really think indoor
[SPEAKER_08]: grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: You think more like outdoor, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But he, and not to say he didn't do
outdoor, but I don't think the,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the ground in most of Australia
is indicative of doing outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you really need to like, you know,
like an auger to dig the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just so hard and you need to
condition everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: So dude, he was doing indoor stuff and how
life stumbled onto him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was posting pics of these fucking water
jacket, cooled lights, like these high
[SPEAKER_08]: pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I remember those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, what the fuck are they doing
down under?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the ones, those are ones where
they are actually putting down into the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, like not over them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were down inside with the water
tubes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he could put your fucking hands right
around the lake, like no heat.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously in Australia, anyways,
we just started talking and, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: we just started trading some strange
again.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all free.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, Hey, maybe I got something.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I hear he's like, can you,
what do you got?
[SPEAKER_08]: Would he grow it in Canada?
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent him some stuff and the next thing
you know, it was like, he started breeding
[SPEAKER_08]: some of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started breeding some of his stuff and
we were like, it's a good collab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did a few, just our own things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's right around, you know,
the time that just about a year,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe two years before heaven's stair,
we went down and brother's grim.
[SPEAKER_08]: Went out of business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: They stopped selling seeds on heaven's
stairway right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And dude, if you wanted brother grim seeds
back in the day, they were like 150 bucks
[SPEAKER_08]: a pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they were top of the line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was big bucks back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And not everybody could obviously afford
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they stopped selling seeds and I
knew that because again, my close
[SPEAKER_08]: relationship with RC at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we reached out to Mr. Soul at the
time and said, dude, do you mind if we,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, knock off some of your strains,
make some F twos and send them out on the
[SPEAKER_08]: sea bay for everybody to fucking get,
you know, a chance for your genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he gave us permission to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And dude, that's basically what we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how we started space brothers
was just basically knocking off everything
[SPEAKER_08]: brother's grim.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, dude, that did some really crazy
things over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, again, once I got the a 11 from cats,
you, that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of the genius crosses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And did the, all the green giant and
what's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he have the Vietnamese black stuff
too?
[SPEAKER_08]: So he was one of the ones, uh,
him and cushy man are the only two that I
[SPEAKER_08]: know personally that actually got the,
uh, anonymous Vietnamese black and dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: he crossed out Vietnamese black with legit
Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I never smoked it, but I seen pictures
of it and I talked to people that did
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like trippy sativa is like, and that was
that skink.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you call that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: 303 spice or something weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 303 spice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: And dude, I remember even all the,
uh, the dream giant, uh, crosses like huge
[SPEAKER_08]: buds, dude, huge buds, like huge buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he got into that, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: he crossed that with the Neville haze.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, again, he loved the sativas.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess Australia is a good, good place to
do the sativas outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can find the suitable soil to do
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, then, uh, we just, once heaven's
stairway went down, he went over to that,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, what is that UK place?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause at the same time as heaven's
stairway was getting busted seeds in the
[SPEAKER_08]: UK, became legal gypsy.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other guy dock something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Oh, Dr. Green thumb, Dr. Green thumb.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he's in Canada here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had a forum and he was selling seeds
over in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where Farid and I ended up our
relationship ended there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, there's literally, I shut down
everything right after heaven's stairway
[SPEAKER_08]: went down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of people, but I said,
uh, I sent all my stock to, to doc
[SPEAKER_08]: chronic.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was anything spice brother related
and that, and I just split it up after
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, dude, then he just fell off the
face of the earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could find that guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I reached out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't find anybody that knows him.
[SPEAKER_08]: The last thing I did here is that he got
bit by a black type man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's pretty, pretty rough
snake in Australia.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, he, he made it, but I think he got
pretty fucked up from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, who is this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I don't know what happened to
him, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had people reach out to me over the
years, asking where he is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, dude, if you find him,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hell, I'm on looking for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, yeah, I would love to reach out and
get ahold of him again.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember his string dizzy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely not Hives.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the weird, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't look like weed weed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The not ABC, not ABC, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not ABC.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a never, uh, never release it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he would never even send me any seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: He crossed that shit with everything,
but, uh, everybody wanted it, but nobody
[SPEAKER_08]: could get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder why, why he held it so tight.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Hive worked on it too, or something
similar, maybe not ABC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, but again, you know, I, and now I know
that, uh, inspectors working with it,
[SPEAKER_08]: like he's got some crosses of it out
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I think it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to grow some, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's cool looking, you know,
like, I don't know what it smokes like,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, that's, that's the spice
brothers thing, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it was a good relationship that we had
a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like whenever I would find, even today,
if I see spice brother seeds, I get really
[SPEAKER_03]: stoked and try to get them from whoever
has them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that, that's a very fun spot in my
heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I see spice brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's special to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to get some, I actually have a
couple of packs here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what they are.
[SPEAKER_08]: And somebody sent them to me with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some original demand seeds in the original
heaven stairway pack too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I just sent the, uh,
gee, black widow, the cushy man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause, uh, he's the vomit female,
if you know, again, you also did endless
[SPEAKER_03]: sky work, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I helped develop that with doc green
thumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me more about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Iranian indica, um, crossed with,
uh, a strain of his called grenadine,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is a G 13 cross.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I'm not sure which G 13, a G 13.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, he had very, very few seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was building a house and he sent me,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know a couple of dozen seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked through them and made some,
you know, F twos for him and sent him back
[SPEAKER_08]: like a couple thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was my part with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he ran with it from there and made his
own selections.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually sent him the mom back with
the seeds that I had found.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, cool guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, he's still in business now doing lots
of good stuff up here, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the earliest feminized seed sellers
that I remember that was in the North
[SPEAKER_08]: America, uh, right up there with the,
the classic clone company from see who
[SPEAKER_08]: they were, but they were the first ones to
get a hold.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was, uh, I think it was high,
but again, you're selling his,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, yeah, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We tried it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The XC it worked on a couple of strains
and a couple of it wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's, that's, that's what people
don't realize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with reversals, like it's not all
inclusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what spray you're using,
no matter what type it's, it really is
[SPEAKER_03]: dependent on the health of the plant,
the type of plant, the genetics of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and how it reverses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just found, uh, I don't know if you
could see these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can see those.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you got is a Jojo candy haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something by barefoot alpha
push.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like alpha F 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't, I still have some crystal
locomotive to the Jojo did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you, that was a good strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very good strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're his train wreck S ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did killer stuff way, way ahead of his
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was, I honestly think that,
and this is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly think a lot of the Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: She knows that are going around now all
came from CBA, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those first feminized public crosses.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when all of a sudden that you
started, you know, seeing that catch you
[SPEAKER_08]: found a catch you won.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was ghost found one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was the abuse of,
and, oh, great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they all just kind of came around
the same time that that first feminized
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubba Kush cross came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just, it makes things to make it does
make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, whether they are or not,
I dunno.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just funny that they were everywhere
and there's so many different phenos and
[SPEAKER_08]: it's like, well, we all know that it's
really hard to get an identical,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, from the mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but there's clothes and different
nuances.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The story goes is that the Bubba Kush
seeds that went out were half OG Kush and
[SPEAKER_03]: half of a plant called Bubba that was an
urban lights plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like normal lights, OG Kush,
you cross them, you're going to get OG
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush expressions, even in the S one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they may not be identical to that mom
exactly, but they're close.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like any S one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like recessive pop out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Howie, you mentioned Peabod earlier was,
did you ever hear of it referred to by any
[SPEAKER_03]: other name?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I got to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lived in Wyoming for a number of years
before I came to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time I got here, it was the
Colorado peony bud, the Peabod.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were lucky, you knew somebody in
that specific area or somebody,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, local who knew somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and you could get it, you know,
pretty handily back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, the clones were held really
tightly by the group in the valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not something that was readily
shared with outsiders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, at one point, um, I had the clone,
um, but it was before I had a medical
[SPEAKER_05]: debacle back before I met most everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I lost pretty much everything I
had after that and couldn't not get it
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I am a really hopeful CTG who had,
was originally from Colorado, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: who's now working with some Peabod that he
got from, um, assorted sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I'm hoping that he gets the,
gets it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying it's going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have really good faith in him,
uh, as far as his breeding and abilities
[SPEAKER_05]: go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, it, it was, uh, it, it was called
the Peonia paralyzer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had, yeah, it had, it had a couple of
other, you know, snazzy names,
[SPEAKER_05]: depending upon where you were.
[SPEAKER_05]: I happened to, I happen to live in the
Denver area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but if you went up North to like Fort
Collins, where CSU is, uh, everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: referred to it as the paralyzer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody knew it was the same bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, you just, you couldn't get the
piney taste out of your mouth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it was that really big, beautiful,
heavy smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's perfect for a, you know,
nice Colorado night sitting out under the
[SPEAKER_05]: stars or under a campfire.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, a few years ago when he was
friends, um, uh, Muir hit me up and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Hey, I have some, um, I didn't know
who Muir was at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that wasn't from your guys's era.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought he was some guy on Facebook
that people knew that it was kind of old
[SPEAKER_03]: school.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, Hey, I have some, uh,
Netherlands, purple Indica, but I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: sure this is the, I think he said pay on a
purple paralyzer gave me the seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, maybe I should give
these to P bud because he called himself P
[SPEAKER_03]: bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's looking for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have regretted that ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was in those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually gave him to my friend,
Matt elite to give to P bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they stayed with Matt for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they may be coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm pretty stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if we can get it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thumbs up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, you know, and like D
said, yeah, it may not be a perfect
[SPEAKER_05]: expression of what, what it was,
but it's just like, uh, it's just like
[SPEAKER_05]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, um, you, you know, SGP it's still
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Posh.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were joking about that, you know,
uh, with the East coast sour D,
[SPEAKER_05]: which we got back, you know, not that long
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a whole lot of people were like,
Oh, it kind of grows funky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have really tight nugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and you hear people and you're just
like, could you just smoke it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't evaluate it based on the fact that
the name is from a 20 year old strain,
[SPEAKER_05]: like evaluate it based on what it does for
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, it's still as good today
as it was 20 years ago when we first got
[SPEAKER_03]: our hands on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone identified it as the 96 cut to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that rings any bells, there's so many
different cuts people talk about now,
[SPEAKER_03]: like they've named so many.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think there was only a few cuts
back in the day that people had,
[SPEAKER_03]: and now there's like 90 thanks to the
different seed lines and whatnot and
[SPEAKER_03]: people making claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the one, the one name that I do
hear attached to that a lot is mirror to
[SPEAKER_03]: his name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard he was passing it, uh,
with the 77 crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I've heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're any of you guys in the 77 crew?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, but I mean, I'm good friends with,
you know, several people who, who
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely were, you know, we were,
we were really good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skitty and I, and, and Demaine even knew
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were good friends with Scoosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was a key, you know, key member of the
77.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, you know, 77 himself too,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were part of the pool of enough kids to
be part of that club yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in, back in that time, we weren't the
cool kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a different time.
[SPEAKER_07]: People were really, you know, after having
stairway got popped, people went fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: tight, private sites started popping up
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like, cause like legit,
dude, you could fucking go to jail in the
[SPEAKER_08]: States for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: For growing weed ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even still now with it legal,
you'd have to really fuck up to go to
[SPEAKER_08]: jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the States, dude, like,
I was growing in Louisiana, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ended up at Angola.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you were also, you were also one,
you know, you also were immediately like,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay, I can open a private site.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you salvaged, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You salvaged how many of us like right
away from that core group of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: CWO.
[SPEAKER_05]: G people that we've been interacting with
already for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, so, so I did have the
raccoon lodge open before we did the
[SPEAKER_02]: cabana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember, remember all the,
you know, remember all the people that
[SPEAKER_05]: were there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we are, we aren't necessarily in
total contact with every day now,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I mean, we had, you know, Budmeiser
and we had, you know, moonshine and
[SPEAKER_05]: doctor, you know, Mr. Dank or Dr. Dank or
what, you know, we had, we had the doctor,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that's, that's before the doctor
came in.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason he came and stayed at my house
is because he met me, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: through the lot raccoon lodge,
you know, when he, you know, when he
[SPEAKER_05]: needed a place to crash out here and same
as you, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the raccoon lodge tightened up a lot of
our friendships, you know, that we already
had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we moved from kind of becoming
friends in public and then being forced
[SPEAKER_05]: into a private kind of smaller world where
some of us really bonded very well
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: How the refuge of overgrows this,
how essentially the, as we're getting into
[SPEAKER_03]: this, the raccoon lodge into the can of
Cabana started then we were, we were in
[SPEAKER_02]: TCB first, wasn't that, and then TCB with
clips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they discontinued, that's when I
think y'all said, Steve, open up a raccoon
[SPEAKER_02]: lodge or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Incorporated everybody from there into the
raccoon lodge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think at that time, that's when
cannabis world where we were all mostly
[SPEAKER_08]: hanging out, it was starting to get crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, there was the trolls from
overgrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're starting to migrate over to,
you know, I think there was a shark tank
[SPEAKER_08]: at cannabis world too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just started getting messy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like, you know, that's when the
sharing was became a lot more private and
[SPEAKER_08]: where the private sites came in much
handier, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you didn't want to really broadcast
so much then exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: People were starting to realize that it
took work to find phenos and they weren't
[SPEAKER_08]: so willing to just willy nilly throw them
out there to just anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people started to hoard strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, well, and again,
depending upon your perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: cause I remember at one of the big parties
in California, when, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I first met, you know, uh, inspector
and, um, you know, he was explaining to me
[SPEAKER_05]: how he was a third generation grower and
that some of the strains were coming in
[SPEAKER_05]: his family from his grandfather's side and
that he had made a family commitment not
[SPEAKER_05]: to share them at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, till he, you know, till, you know,
he had an agreement with his father and
[SPEAKER_05]: grandfather that, you know, there would
come a point where he would share them,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it wasn't then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was trying to explain to me that,
so does it make me, you know, a greedy
[SPEAKER_05]: person if I can't share something that I
promised my father and grandfather I
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't share?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, dude, it doesn't, you know,
I, I hold the man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a really great, great guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really love him for his principles.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was very firm in what he could and
couldn't share.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, he developed that into a,
a huge, you know, situation like he's got
[SPEAKER_05]: going on now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, God bless him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He, you know, he didn't betray his family.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't betray his morals and he was
able to do what he, you know, and now he's
[SPEAKER_05]: sharing those genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's very, still very, very hardline
honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably one of the biggest influences in
my life on what I, what I model my
[SPEAKER_03]: character and how I carry myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is the most honest person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people accidentally,
you know, send him $14,000 and him return
[SPEAKER_03]: it because they didn't put, you know,
what they wanted and he doesn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: give him the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's crazy what I've seen him do.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guy is just a walking book of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like when I, when I met him in
California at one of the parties there,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was like, dude, he was so much younger
than everybody else too, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, and, you know, we're all do
sampling these strains, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: try to go through 32 strains in like two
days or something at the cannabis world
[SPEAKER_08]: cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and here's the inspector over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like a college kid taking an exam,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like fucking just so serious and
dude, like, yeah, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were really fun times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, yeah, we, you know, the parties were
fucking wild, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and those parties were just walking
books of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just didn't matter what situation
you were in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a small scale, really little grower,
but I mean, there were guys with big
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were guys with big indoor grows,
guys with little outdoor grows,
[SPEAKER_05]: little indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a full spectrum, but they
included, you know, inspector,
[SPEAKER_05]: Shaba, the doctor, Rosarifo, NCJ,
demon, you know, overtokes and the
[SPEAKER_05]: overtokes Kendo, you know, God,
God bless Kendo.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he and I, he and I are brothers
from another mother that just don't see
[SPEAKER_05]: the world from the same dead eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a wild man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a wild man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've, I've spent, I spent a week
with him up on one of his, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: grows when he was still down in Cowleys
out in the boonies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a crazy time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a, he's a super crazy, crazy guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an episode with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we, we watched.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just say for the record, when it came
down to whose idea it was for the secret
[SPEAKER_08]: mods at the cabana, if Kendall thinks it
was his idea, honestly, dude, that was
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking 18 years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know whose idea it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: If he says it was his, he's probably
right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And kudos to him for thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing I'll say about that,
it was, it was shitty for me because all
[SPEAKER_08]: the mods were hidden, but it was me that
always had to go deliver the bad news.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or deliver the punishment, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was always like, Oh, these guys had
secret fucking moderator handles,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The big banana or the rock lobster or
something, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Comes in rowdy nudie, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was always D man that was like,
Hey, you can't do that because the mod
[SPEAKER_08]: team said, well, D man's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you lies the crown, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, Kendall, Kendall was a big part
of the command to do like getting the
[SPEAKER_08]: commander up and running for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, like, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with old song.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with moguls.
[SPEAKER_05]: God rest his soul.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there was a couple other ones in
there too that just shout out to funky
[SPEAKER_02]: nugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Funky nugs too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Funky nugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And science.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, JJ Jameson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: JJ Jameson who's still around and peaks in
now and again, but yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we don't hear from him much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, we've, you know,
to this day, we still see, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: people pop in and out from 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's nice to know that some folks are
still rocking it hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, good, good, good breeders like Jace,
the case are still out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stache still out there working hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, uh, Jace, he's a New Zealand
fellow too, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually popped in recently since the,
uh, re reborn of the rebirth of the
[SPEAKER_08]: cabana, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of timeline, when was the
original kind of inception of the cabana?
[SPEAKER_08]: December the second 2006, my birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was coming online.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I remember it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: When, uh, cannabis world went down,
we went over to the raccoon lodge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kitty asked Kitty hosted us there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, we, we sort of just reached out
to some members at the raccoon lodge who
[SPEAKER_08]: we thought would be a good fit,
you know, like muggles and, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: old song and, you know, buckweed and how
we, and obviously everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a bunch of people help us in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we just banged it out over five
months there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we were just racking ideas off
each other's head, what would work,
[SPEAKER_08]: what wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we kind of realized,
you know, we didn't want a shark tank.
[SPEAKER_08]: No politics, no politics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we obviously thought that,
you know, firearms wasn't a good fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we were, we were unique like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the other sites.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of people didn't like us
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were known as the care bears.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it stood the test of time though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like doing it a certain way, keeping it a
certain way, keeping a private all those
[SPEAKER_03]: years, letting certain people in sounds
like you did it like an onion where there
[SPEAKER_03]: were layers and you involve certain people
in fit better and molded better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we first opened it, you know,
we, it was sort of like, if I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: mistaken, these guys can correct me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was sort of like we left the threads
open.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody would nominate somebody in and
they were kind of like, get a vote on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we started realizing that that's
not really fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, everybody sort of deserves a
second chance.
[SPEAKER_08]: If a member, a current member is vouching
for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're putting their account on the
line.
[SPEAKER_08]: We felt that was good enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just started locking those threads
for nominations.
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody wanted you in, dude,
you were in as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it worked good that way for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of participation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when Colorado went legal,
then a lot of people came in from
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado, like it just like a boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when Kirby and, you know,
green mofo and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just, it was, we had an influx of
members there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that when Tierra Rojo got into came in,
Paco came in for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody came in for a little while,
especially anybody who was friends with
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Kirby came in, just a whole influx of
guys in his kind of little core group at
[SPEAKER_05]: that time came in with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, a lot of them have always
been members.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some have just popped back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Paco popped back in not that long ago as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Paco, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great to see just the fact
that there is a renewed interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were, you know, we were on,
I was the last captain of the ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: These two guys ahead of me, led the place
for a lot of years and had everything
[SPEAKER_05]: going pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, as people age and attrition
and you don't have as many older members
[SPEAKER_05]: meeting new people to invite in,
we became kind of the road to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, self-defeating prophecy where,
you know, I was, you know, I was asking
[SPEAKER_05]: people for donations and looking at the
thing as a dinosaur, like when do we go
[SPEAKER_05]: extinct when we run out of donations?
[SPEAKER_05]: The key to me is kind of like,
what do I do to help lead the ship into a
[SPEAKER_05]: new era?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's where Curbs comes in,
you know, to the line on the story,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you guys start talking about
doing that with Curb, about maybe changing
[SPEAKER_03]: hands?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he approached me in all honesty to
my two friends sitting here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In all honesty, Kirby approached me last
year, last summer, early in the summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve was having an off season.
[SPEAKER_05]: Darren was in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of hinted something to Darren about
it way back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he seemed really amenable to
potentially letting Kirby, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: take over.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Steve's position and his, you know,
situation was such that he and I weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: able to actually communicate out,
you know, what Kirby wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of kept it in the back of my
head and I literally said to Kirby,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, give me some time, you know,
let Darren get out of the hospital.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let, you know, let Steve get through his
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything magically worked itself out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kirby actually called me that week and
said, hey, you know, you talk to those
[SPEAKER_05]: guys anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I go, no, but I will right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll call you back in a little while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hung up phone with him, called D.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was actually a Friday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then called Kirby back and said,
dude, you're the man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got, you've got a plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll save us from going extinct.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've always worried, you know,
as we've gotten older, things have become
[SPEAKER_05]: more legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: When Darren originally took this thing on
under his belt, he had to worry about
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadian laws, Canadian police.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was living here in Colorado where things
were always fairly mellow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve, who was bouncing from Louisiana to
New York, and then eventually ended up
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to, you know, some coaxing from my
family and I got him out to a good place,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a place we knew he'd be able to
establish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we all are, you know,
two years later and the site still running
[SPEAKER_05]: itself just fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I took it over, it was still running
itself just fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing wrong with the site, except that
as older members pass and we've lost a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of good people, as people's situations
change and they leave and don't come back,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got, you know, a handful of guys
who are between 40 and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: 80 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not bringing on any new blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I interrupt and ask, you know,
what did you guys think of Instagram when
[SPEAKER_00]: it was coming online?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know when that was now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how aware of you guys, how aware of
Instagram were you guys when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging or how, when did you guys look at
it and think, oh, this is, this is like
[SPEAKER_00]: the new form that people are communicating
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it weren't for Darren and Steve talking
to me about Instagram, I'm the least
[SPEAKER_05]: technologically inclined of the group.
[SPEAKER_05]: Darren starts telling me, yeah,
you don't have to go to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: ICU or you want to look at pot pictures,
you just have to go to this, this new
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, new thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people just post pictures and there's
like thousands of, and I like fishing and
[SPEAKER_05]: fishing just, yeah, you can go and look at
thousands of fish and fishing pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, yeah, now you can go and look at
thousands of pot, pot pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh, really?
Fishing and pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fishing and pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you got me interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really Steve who got me to even
understand that there was something out
[SPEAKER_05]: there doing that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I actually joined Instagram in 2015.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure when it came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason I joined is because my
young daughter at the time, I don't,
[SPEAKER_08]: how old would she be then?
[SPEAKER_08]: She would be 15.
[SPEAKER_08]: She had Instagram account and I don't
know, she was telling me she had all these
[SPEAKER_08]: followers from school and I'm like,
okay, well, I'll download this app and you
[SPEAKER_08]: know, I follow my daughter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, she's got 870 fucking people
following me on Instagram, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are these people following my little
girl, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just tear a strip off her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get off that platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, dad, they have pot pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, what, wait, what, what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I started looking at, oh fuck,
dude, there's like really cool pot
[SPEAKER_07]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started finding people I know from the
cabana.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, oh, this guy's over here
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do I work this, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So for me, it was 2015 and yeah,
I just never really looked back.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because we had such old vBulletin
software, the command, it was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was really hard to post pictures
because it really sucked, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was hard, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't like it, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, Instagram was easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I seen right away, dude, like once I
seen that, dude, there's like thousands of
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis accounts there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, wow, this is the new trend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the forums are going to go really
bye-bye now, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily, I don't think that happened,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, it turned out obviously,
as we all know, Instagram sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suck for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your thoughts on that
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got 6,000 followers on Instagram and
anytime I make a post, 10 people like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, I just like, dude, I'm not even
a big guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just says I sell cannabis seeds or I
breed cannabis seeds and that's enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instagram algorithm says, no, fuck you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the feeling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even your followers, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, yeah, it sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see like all these big accounts,
like CSI and he's got a quarter of a
[SPEAKER_08]: million followers and he's got like,
you know, five accounts and they all have
[SPEAKER_08]: the same cause they're all backup accounts
cause one gets banned or shut down.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just has to start.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's a time suck, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really, it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's when one thing came in and
said, dude, let's make the forums relevant
[SPEAKER_08]: again.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can post pictures and on the
forum.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't really, it was never about
pictures for the rebranding or the
[SPEAKER_08]: rebirth.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just about, you know, the comments,
making it more relevant.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the communication of the plan,
you know, on Instagram, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, I'll interrupt here and just say
that one thing we've discussed in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: is like how kind of going back to some of
the early points you guys made,
[SPEAKER_00]: how well connected you all were and how
meaningful those connections were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one thing about Instagram is obviously
everyone's quite alienated and quite
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated and you have these very,
uh, brief interactions with people on a
[SPEAKER_00]: post.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next day it's gone,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not, it's not gone, but like,
you're going to have to go find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: abyss of the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so you don't really have that kind
of accumulation of history as you would on
[SPEAKER_08]: a forum thread or even the interaction,
you know, from the original poster,
[SPEAKER_08]: whoever posts that awesome pick,
you know, they can post their little
[SPEAKER_08]: description of what this is, but it's not
indicative of having a conversation,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, or even asking a question,
you know, it's like, we need to help desks
[SPEAKER_08]: again.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need these breeders to have their own
forums where they can, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: communicate with their customers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it says, and it's just like,
if you look at the command and now just
[SPEAKER_08]: about every breeder that has their own
form there, dude, they've been an original
[SPEAKER_08]: member, like great either from inception
or from the Colorado influx of 2012.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, and some of these guys are
fucking huge breeders, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, so as we all know, and that's what
they need.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, if we can get content there and get
their customers to come and interact with
[SPEAKER_08]: them, we know they're busy people,
but, you know, even like Inspector dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: he's chiming in, people are posting stuff
about his strains and that's what we
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted a place for the breeders to be
able to talk to the customers,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and answer some questions like
it used to be, you know, like get away
[SPEAKER_08]: from the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you can post the pretty pictures
there, but we know that when, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: Inspector posts a pick, dude, it's not
hitting a quarter of a million followers.
[SPEAKER_08]: If he hits 1%, maybe 2%, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, whereas, you know, I'm not saying,
you know, I'm not being naive saying that
[SPEAKER_08]: we're going to replace Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not about the pictures at the cabana.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about the interaction and about even
the smaller guys, like these up and coming
[SPEAKER_08]: breeders, that's who we really want to
help give them a platform that Instagram
[SPEAKER_08]: can't do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like these guys are just a shadow band
with, you know, a thousand followers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because they're posting cannabis
pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, come over to the cabana,
dude, but Kirby's giving it fucking free
[SPEAKER_08]: rein, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Post your seeds, post your grows,
you know, we're going to eventually,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, hopefully have a, maybe sort of
like a Seabay kind of platform,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like that would be cool for up
and coming breeders again to get a name,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to make it really clear to the
people listening and watching,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of cabana is now open again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be really clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't actually said that,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inviting people to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It went public a hundred percent on
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_08]: So dude, please register.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wide open.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can look at the forum now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see the 18 years of history that's
there from everything that has been
[SPEAKER_08]: posted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of skitty picks, skitty grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's a few how he grows in
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of demand grows, but if you want to
post, you got to register, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: so it's, we're, it's not a hard ask.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can read it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's there for you to read.
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope that you see something that
entices you to make you want to join
[SPEAKER_08]: because there's up and coming things.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's things that are coming,
you know, probably some giveaways,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, we're going to have some cabana
packs, things like that with some seeds,
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe from some up and coming breeders,
you know, we just want to see people
[SPEAKER_08]: posting their grows and if we can help,
like, as we still know, lots of people are
[SPEAKER_08]: still just new growers right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing it in the cabana.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people are saying, I'm just got
two or three grows under my belt.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, yeah, we forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we all got so tired of answering
the same old questions over and over again
[SPEAKER_08]: that we forget that dude, we have to pass
this knowledge on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't, we can't just not, you know,
we can't rely on other people just to do
[SPEAKER_08]: it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably more new growers now than
ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have so many more tools than we
have.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, LED lights, you know,
all the cool toys to have.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everybody knows Kirby was supposed
to be here, but he got stuck in an
[SPEAKER_03]: airport.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yes, maybe a separate episode with him
or another one of these, because there's,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to get Kirby here because,
you know, we can, we can give you the
[SPEAKER_08]: whole history of how we got to the cabana,
but it's Kirby's idea and his baby from
[SPEAKER_08]: here, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's got big plans and he's going to
make forms relevant again.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like we're not going to say
we're going after other forums,
[SPEAKER_08]: but dude, we're going after other forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that were there, like I don't
have any good relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, my, my whole, my whole
relationship with that was I would go to a
[SPEAKER_03]: forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was usually run by someone who ran a
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd see, I have a seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I don't interact with them in
certain ways, I'd be banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really my, my whole experience
of forums just didn't happen that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really what happened at the
cabana, you know, the original,
[SPEAKER_08]: because that was part of the other things
that we had.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we said, no seed sales, you know,
we didn't want any seed spam.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'd literally by policy pushed all of
our friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still scared of posting seed stuff
there, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reality is that we need a new
approach to move ahead to dinosaur either
[SPEAKER_05]: collapses and goes extinct or we move
ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having had all those parties and
interacted with a lot of guys who are 20
[SPEAKER_05]: or 30 years younger than me who have other
aspirations and ideas, which I wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking about or didn't, didn't ever
think about, I guess, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: really brings a whole new perspective to
what, what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't, you know, we remember the days
when at seed bay, you know, like if you
[SPEAKER_05]: bought something from, you know,
doc green thumbs, and you had a question
[SPEAKER_05]: and you post it up in his help forum,
like, what, how do I grow this or how long
[SPEAKER_05]: does, you know, you'd get either him to
answer himself or one of his helpers,
[SPEAKER_05]: or, you know, a group of four or five
other people would jump in and answer and
[SPEAKER_05]: try to help.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of what, you know,
is missing out there is, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's easy to go buy a pack of seeds,
but what do you expect from it?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and it's good to have people you
know, I mean, that's how my relationship
[SPEAKER_05]: with the, my relationship with motor
rebel, you know, was all based on beta
[SPEAKER_05]: testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They relied on me to be honest,
which I brutally was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and I, and I always tried
to be as descriptive as I could.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if somebody put themselves in my shoes,
you know, all right, I'm going to grow a
[SPEAKER_05]: few of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could give them an easy way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Show them the picture, show them the root,
show them the plant through several
[SPEAKER_05]: stages, and then show them buds and
flower, and then show them a finished
[SPEAKER_05]: picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I appreciated that it
allowed us to become, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: personal friends way back, you know,
before it was posh to be friends with
[SPEAKER_05]: someone on the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we also knew that intrinsically
him being in, you know, Canada and me
[SPEAKER_05]: being in Canada, and me being in Colorado,
we were absolutely no harm to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we became, you know, we're,
we're, the three of us right here with
[SPEAKER_05]: three Stooges, we're brothers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are my brothers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brothers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any brothers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only a brother, only a brother would fly
down to Canada, to his other brothers in
[SPEAKER_08]: New York City, up in a fucking truck and
move them to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an awesome story as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another time when there's enough time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, Darren drove a 18 wheeler with
all my life's possessions from the Bronx
[SPEAKER_02]: to Littleton, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: When my flight was delayed, I was supposed
to accompany him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a brother right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the house sale was delayed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but it was it was a, oh,
it's a great story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, you got to, I got to tell it the
night before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and the cops next door to a New York
City cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a narcotics detective and she was
not nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was not nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: She did not get along with skinny.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got this fucking giant truck loaded
up with all skinny's possessions in the
[SPEAKER_08]: driveway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a shared driveway with the cop
and skinny, right skinny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I own it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had right away through it to get to
her parking spot in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the time that I lived there over
five years, she abused her privileges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she parked her cop car right there in
my driveway, blocking everybody from using
[SPEAKER_02]: the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, I got pissed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd start knocking on her door and
asking her to move her freaking cop car.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all the while, like she'd
stand in the driveway, talking on the
[SPEAKER_02]: phone underneath my second story air
conditioner, dripping sour diesel on her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, we had all the stuff loaded on
the truck before we're ready to leave.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the next skinny and I,
we hop on the subway, we go down the top
[SPEAKER_08]: of the Times Square, go get some dumplings
or something, just to chill out,
[SPEAKER_08]: do some last minute tourist stuff for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: We come back.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as we walk around the corner,
walk, there's fucking cop cars everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're like, Holy fuck, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We walk up to the driveway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the lady cop being a fucking
Karen, get this fucking truck out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: driveway, get this truck out of the
driveway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And meanwhile, it's like, it's dark and on
skinny street, there's parking on both
[SPEAKER_08]: sides of the street.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in New York City.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Bronx in the Bronx.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got this giant 26 foot truck there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cops said, well, you're going to have
to move your truck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, move it where I can't even
get out of the fucking driveway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember they were going to tow it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, dude, go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Call the tow truck right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truck was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't do it because they didn't
have the space to pull the truck out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We attached the tow truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: People parked right up to the driveways.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no way you were getting that
fucking tow truck in there to get this
[SPEAKER_08]: giant truck.
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, the cop had to tell the lady
Karen cop, dude, just shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're leaving at six o'clock in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just stop being a bitch and go to bed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Skinny and I went into house got high and
I fucking left the next morning and drove
[SPEAKER_08]: to Colorado and ended up at Howie's house
on the giant truck.
[SPEAKER_08]: In front of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think about that horrible woman.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, sorry, a sidetrack.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was just a funny, funny story of
moving skinny out of New York to Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was kind of a top cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: She actually escorted Escobar when he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's the one that they brought here?
[SPEAKER_02]: El Chapo.
[SPEAKER_02]: She escorted El Chapo at one point,
if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she made us made herself a name with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you know, while uninvolved officer
Karen in said truck, you guys left out a
[SPEAKER_05]: very important part of the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, Darren left Steve's house in
New York, headed for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the average speed limit
between here and there is like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know, sixty five to as much as
seventy five miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Darren calls me from I want to say it was
like somewhere near Ames, Iowa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like he should be closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the truck wouldn't move out of low
gear?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a governor on it, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So this truck is it's not doing more than
fifty five on a downhill slope,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember going through the Poconos
fucking a crawl up ten miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to take me fucking
forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did I sign up for?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was I was supposed to be with him,
but my house sale was delayed,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I had to stay an extra day in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Darren was on a time schedule to get
this done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he had to be back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like you said, that's a brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darren, our huge points that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how he let me stay there in his
basement for a month or whenever until I
[SPEAKER_02]: rented my first house.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is where the forms could could
lead.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure we're just one of many
lifelong friendships that those old forms,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, started, you know, like.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I know these guys still talk to
other people that from from years ago,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like it was a fun time and it
would be nice to make forms fun again.
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to even jinx us, but we've
had no real trolls or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if trolls aren't a thing or
if they just know they're definitely a
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, dude, like, but I'll tell you
one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kirby's not going to have any.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe patience for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it seems very cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: The receptions has been very cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're almost got a thousand new members
since we opened up January 1st.
[SPEAKER_08]: So not just barely two months,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, it's not huge or anything,
but, dude, I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's new blood.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are probably going to, you know,
dip their toes in the water and feel how
[SPEAKER_08]: it is, you know, because you might have
bad experiences with other forms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you said, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the king of the bad experiences of
forums, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I I, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But real, real quick, can I please give a
shout out to Detective Diane Spangenberg
[SPEAKER_02]: in New York Bronx?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diana Spangenberg Spangenberg,
Spang, but I think of Spangen and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: a bird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the way we've made a lot of friends
and lifelong friends, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's and it's not some really cool
people have passed, dude, like some really
[SPEAKER_08]: cool people like, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, you know, it's like 20
years is a long time, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: like, and we're older, you know,
you guys are a lot younger and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_08]: you guys are going to do it all justice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Kirby's going to do everything
justice, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like he has mad respect for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have mad respect for him, for what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love him like a brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wish him nothing but success.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100 percent, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're behind him.
[SPEAKER_08]: We support him and we're going to be here
to help him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, you know, how hands on will
be like without skitties being a huge help
[SPEAKER_08]: to us right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, dude, since switching over to the
new San Foro software and all that,
[SPEAKER_08]: you skitties, skitties has been like the
go to guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been rushing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been rocking his socks off,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just been like a trooper.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still waiting to get the rest of our
smileys back, but we'll get there one day,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, too, that for our
little collaboration here, this is also
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know exactly what kinds of
shows we'll do with the cabana and you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys in the future, but I can see lots of
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we could do little highlight
segments from the cabana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could do really topical ones if you
guys want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could let you guys host your own show
if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's lots of interesting
opportunities to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think three of us might like to do some
comedy skits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys, you guys is like,
what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Symbiotic nature with each other and how
each other's balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, dude, and like, you know,
I'm sure like Kirby, he's got big ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to do events.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to get the cabana out there and,
you know, get some merch going and stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, more podcasts, things like
that, you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you guys to have a discord channel
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's, that's going to be a
discord.
[SPEAKER_08]: We stumbled famously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have many more Brock's tales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I bet you have tons there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have the discord thing loaded up on
the site, but none of us really know how
[SPEAKER_08]: to use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use discord all the time for playing
Pokemon Go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, you know, I played the game as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that game sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get Howie into ours then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think Howie needs to meet Denali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, give him a Denali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we have a friend that's probably
about your age, but he's also a fisherman
[SPEAKER_03]: extraordinaire.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's about to go fishing with someone real
famous in our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's also a weed guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those two things, I mean, you guys
would get along.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how he did.
[SPEAKER_08]: He likes to eat it in his leg.
[SPEAKER_08]: He says the tug is the drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tug is the drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I got along with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met D-Man through growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met Skitty through trading buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met Buckweed back in the day because he
posted up at CW way back in the day a
[SPEAKER_05]: picture of a fly he tied for bass fishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I literally was like, it was really a
beautiful hand tied frog with movable
[SPEAKER_05]: arms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was super impressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tie anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And God bless him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent me a box of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we became good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Him, me and Waisos went fishing a couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, half of it was for me was just
meeting new people, putting myself out
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And man, the community has just been a
great thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, for sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still waiting for Waisos to come
back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen him strolling.
[SPEAKER_05]: He needs a little tug as the drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get him on some fishing or
something and try to twist his arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that tug is the drug thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how he's tagline.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my tagline.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the cabana is going to be way
different than the other forms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, similar in the whole question and
answer thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're not going to have any troll
bullshit like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be like fun again.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to make it fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have contests.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have, you know,
news, you know, it's all, it's all new.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's all up to date and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of posts to read through and
we encourage everybody to read every last
[SPEAKER_08]: one of them, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much knowledge there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All 18,000 pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such a value there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was, I wrote down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't, I know we didn't bring it up
yet, but like the free for all clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: like most people don't know about that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big thing with you guys,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The free for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FFA.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys remember that one over your head?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was a, it was a, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're talking to strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a specific grade that was passed
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a mass super scope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I don't remember that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't remember that one either.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was so many in my era.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sometimes it's hard for us to stay
relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to still grow the old school
strains where a lot of people just like
[SPEAKER_02]: 1980 just called.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said they want their pounds back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the thing for me, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I popped so many seeds and including so
many of so much of my own gear.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just hard to remember standouts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there were so many standouts,
but you know, you're always just moving on
[SPEAKER_08]: so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you didn't pop them, like,
as we know, they're just going to go to
[SPEAKER_08]: waste, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like still even me, you know, I haven't,
I haven't bred a seed since 2017 and 2018.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do literally have like millions of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, what am I going to fucking do with
them?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, and then, and story of my life,
I've given away far more seeds than I've
[SPEAKER_08]: ever sold.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I think we all have, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I gave away like most of my
collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were just going to go stale just
like these Jojo packs or the Jojo pack
[SPEAKER_02]: over there, which is 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, well, and not everybody stored
everything good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping that, you know, you know,
tissue culture or embryo resurrection.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's something, you know,
dude, cause I am sitting on some pretty
[SPEAKER_08]: old seeds that were not stored properly
that I've just loved to get you,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, some three, nine 11 stuff,
but I have stuff dude from, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that goes back to the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start busting some seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the original stuff that we got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even
know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I germed it, you know, I have such
limited capacities to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta find somebody who wants them
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me a list.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find some people that'll pop them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's probably the idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget, I forget who said it,
but it was one of the wisest, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: comments I ever heard or read on a forum
was that if everybody just took a single
[SPEAKER_08]: pack out of their collection and just
started them, just one pack, everybody,
[SPEAKER_08]: and just see what's there, dude,
we could find the new, new old time,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, and that's all it would take.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a few thousand people just
popping a pack from like the fucking early
[SPEAKER_08]: two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on that path, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm still on the blueberry path where
we're like finding old blueberry for me
[SPEAKER_03]: meant the world, you know, and finally we
locked it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truly blueberry tasting and smelling,
and you could pop a pack of seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're all clones of each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: That took a long time to get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That Tony guy, his blueberry was fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he originally sourced his from DJ
short.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was still the same stuff,
but it was, it was a very early generation
[SPEAKER_03]: before it was super inbred with just a few
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it still had a lot of open space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could still find that super actually
blueberry smelling plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, after a while that was just
gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was all about chasing those down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I had back in the late eighties,
early nineties, um, that was a sativa ish
[SPEAKER_02]: and just little sparse little,
little popcorn nugs up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stems were blood red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just, you could smell one blueberry
plant over a whole room of another strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got something for you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got shit for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're going to like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exactly that it's red stamped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the taste was so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been my biggest chase in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, once I found it, I haven't left
in like six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't believe I let that go along
with the DJ short flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kept that around too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The actually is Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: A pack of those original blueberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my first ever grow, you know,
where I didn't grow bag seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course I knew nothing about
cloning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have these beautiful blueberry
plants that stink like blueberry pie and
[SPEAKER_05]: have these beautiful red stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course I could never get them
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Dutch passion DJ short sold his seeds
through them after a Sega math.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought they even used his stock
or whatever, but later on they used
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was, this was back late, late
nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say that this was before I
moved, before I moved from New Orleans to
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely, we definitely got all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely got all that in spades.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to see what Canadian guys that
love blueberry think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of you guys that have had it
before, I think it'd be a fun journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, I haven't tasted anything
like that since that was just so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I got a garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can get them into there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you guys covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you guys covered on it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy too.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you want to run any?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got, I got you too, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That experience is smelling a real
blueberry plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't smell like skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't smell like anything else,
but just truly jam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It blows people's minds when they smell it
and see it, taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My story was when I was living in New
Orleans, I lived in a hundred and 50 year
[SPEAKER_02]: old house and I had to grow in the back
bedroom and back of the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I was down outside in the backyard,
I could smell the one or two blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: plants over everything else growing in the
room at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the first seeds I ever got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is even well before I was
on the internet or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a friend of a friend went to Amsterdam
and brought back seeds there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One strain was mind control.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was Valley girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was just the two strains,
but it was a, there was Valley girl and
[SPEAKER_02]: the mind control and they were both
phenomenal strains.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course the loss to history,
at least for me, but we still talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: the weed being some old friends to this
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why did I even bring that up?
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smelling out the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dutch cluster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a room full of Valley girl and
just a couple of blueberry plants would
[SPEAKER_02]: just overtake all that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is before I was smart enough to
use carbon filters or even knew about
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon filters was barely on the internet
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had like a real stink going on,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fortunately it was in a part of town
where no one probably either gave a shit
[SPEAKER_02]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would not just rob my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, this, this is way back in my
ghetto growing career back, back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was growing with four inch Rockwell
cubes in rows of rain gutters that I set
[SPEAKER_02]: up on a tilt with one gutter at the end to
catch from all the other drains going into
[SPEAKER_02]: a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for as horrible as the system really
was, it got some really good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was 1988 ish 88.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I think skinny pioneered a lot of
good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 93 ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The eighties I was in Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do, I got my start in
Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like I might've mentioned no internet,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was way back in the late eighties and
had to go source books from, it was
[SPEAKER_02]: Schindler's books on Hennepin had some
obscure weed growing books and started out
[SPEAKER_02]: with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, was able to source of Rockwell
professional lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't even know anything about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to some like building supply
store and we bought a streetlight,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a great, great metal halide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we strung that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first saw my dad's goes,
he was stealing metal halides off
[SPEAKER_03]: streetlights.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dad's like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a metal halide and we grew in South
Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was my start?
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew a guy up here that used to go to a
public works auctions and buy old
[SPEAKER_08]: streetlights for the old municipalities.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're really change of the street.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Hey, just go buy the old fucking new
bulb in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good as new.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: He scrapped the whole arm part of the
scrap metal and just keep the fucking
[SPEAKER_08]: light.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, dude, never, never underestimate the
ingenuity of a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can turn apple into a pipe,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turn rain gutters into a hydro system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably developed nutrient film
technique yourself, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, dude, people have been
copying skinny tech for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as I should remember skinny tech
is, is like the ball.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's legit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only one thing to skinny tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to follow what the dude says.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not skinny tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had more than a few people ask me,
you know, Oh, can I change up the newts a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit in the Rockwell cubes?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like don't talk to skinny.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to tell you, no, you want the
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to, you got to follow the recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So bake good, good baked goods,
you know, and that's why people will wait
[SPEAKER_08]: for skinny packs, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's also why you'll hear me rant
one day about all this crop steering crap
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, where they push the high PPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope none of you guys are super crop
steering fans because I can rip on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Darren, many years ago, Darren talked
me into trying a very low PPM grow with my
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I did switch to EC instead of
PPM anymore, I still keep it low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grow it like a 1.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try telling people the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like you don't necessarily need to
raise the nutrients until it's telling you
[SPEAKER_03]: to do it until you see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you even push it like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: The resins and the flavors and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you start pushing that you lose it,
trade out for weight and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Oh my God, they're
getting like a runoff of three points
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you buying it for good wheat or are
you buying it for biomass?
[SPEAKER_03]: Biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're growing it for the biomass,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, they're all using,
you know, I guess salt nutrients nowadays,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess got really popular, whatever bulk,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still use Pure Blend Pro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to go back with that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has great flavor in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow in dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reality of growing in dirt is like I'm
very small scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grow from my family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reality is that, yeah,
I can look at the Gary Payton.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I can get a clone from Steve of
Gary Payton.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: His is going to yield, you know,
twice, three times as much as mine in some
[SPEAKER_05]: cases, the way, you know, he grows and the
way he pushes things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we both have different needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I go for, you know, I go for what I'm
going to consume.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what comforts me is part of
getting my hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to be an archaeologist,
so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like playing in dirt a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's always been, you know,
it just was a natural easy way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, before the Internet,
you know, when I picked up a few books,
[SPEAKER_05]: it suggested that the easiest way to learn
was growing in dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have and I've you've been using the same
basic formula now for almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a man provide me a great set of
clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's always great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything else you want to get
in before we wrap this episode?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a feeling going to be doing a lot
more with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is I think we got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have to we have to do it
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to join us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm actually nocturnal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to be in bed about four and
a half hours ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty nocturnal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at the total end of my day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know why that my wife has
brought me.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I mean, I've been taking bites while
I've been putting my head off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been trying to sneak it off the
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just been smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mostly pet my cats and I took two long
hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that'll work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, all I have to say to finish off if
that's where we're going is, dude,
[SPEAKER_08]: we got to get Kirby on here because the
next part is like it's it's where we're
[SPEAKER_08]: going, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cold.
[SPEAKER_08]: He made us do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We busted his balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I busted all your balls by proxy to get
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be honest, you'd be busting my
balls even longer than that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say a shout out to demand for helping
me coordinate as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like demand is no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, send on the info.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
