[SPEAKER_02]: All right taking a bit What's up everyone
slowly waking up Okay, I guess we wait for
[SPEAKER_02]: not so we have Some kind of stuff planned
a little planned as much as we plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't plan too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so my apologies in advance How's
everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Slowly waiting for people to show up get
it started so I was thinking of doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: giveaway today, you know at some point of
this shit, so We'll probably do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Got a better idea so not so didn't have
to come up with it Yo, yo yo What's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Habs Jack adjusting the height of my
little thing here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah That's what she said, oh man All
right, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good haircut Seems good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a haircut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really No, I got a haircut last
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it looks good until it mushrooms
out It doesn't really go long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes wide and then it gives you a
dickhead Just like it just expands outward
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can wait for it to fall But I
don't have enough hair left to really make
[SPEAKER_02]: that work whenever my hair Grows out like
it starts doing this thing where it flips
[SPEAKER_02]: and curls right here on the sideburn area
Really really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks cool Peter panties All right,
so what do we want to start off with what
[SPEAKER_02]: did you want to kick it off with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've been doing so again what we're
gonna do is we've done a bunch of shows
[SPEAKER_00]: that are that are like somewhat like
themed, you know and then the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've been doing have kind of been
more a bit more like Some loose subject
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that we discuss and then we riff
off and then we answer some questions and
[SPEAKER_00]: such and it seems like people People are
into that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna do one of those where We're
gonna touch on some different stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: people asked about during the week on our
discord and then We'll riff off that a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and people can answer questions or ask
questions Matt's a little bit better at
[SPEAKER_00]: reading the screen than I am but I'll try
I can feel some for you You can feel some
[SPEAKER_00]: if you see anything that pops up that
looks normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally we wait until It's 150 ish people
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well, yeah, we could start we could
start in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple things that that people wanted
to chat about a little bit was some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll mostly talk about which is sort
of like the Some traditional hash aspects,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some stuff that it's a
little bit more matte where people were
[SPEAKER_00]: asking about like, you know, what's like
the international seed scene like Today,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does that all work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is you know, what is what's changing
in the in the in this in the seed world or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot more Can speak a lot more
eloquently on that than I can really But
[SPEAKER_02]: you can speak on the hash because I I have
never smoked like Afghan Lebanese blonde.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I had a chunk of Silk Road hash
that was Like I didn't smoke it was too
[SPEAKER_02]: scary to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just didn't so it's it's interesting
and like the hash thing you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hash thing is is kind of cool because
you can we can widen it out a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sense of You know and talk about
like some traditional weed cultures Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is a real divide in weed
cultures between cultures that grew weed
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily to make hashish sure and
cultures that grew weed primarily to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: weed You know, yeah and you know that that
aspect and those choices made Made a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of differences for people and now for a
long time America One of the benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: America is that we're isolated from
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like big oceans Yeah on either
side and all that but we're very far away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the hash culture Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditionally all the best hash Sort of
stays local and then some small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: it would go to Europe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and what America typically got was
the B and C grade Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a lot of times Americans especially
Canadians are a little different Canadians
[SPEAKER_00]: had some better connections and some
better smuggling that happened up there
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they sometimes saw a little bit
better of a grade but Americans especially
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they we got the shaft as far as
high grade so a lot of people think of
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if your view of kind bud was like
Beasters Yeah, and that's what you thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it was because that's the only thing
you've experienced a lot of people If you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been to Europe and you haven't and
you haven't and you haven't been tied into
[SPEAKER_00]: those communities, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you probably haven't smoked the best
of the best And so there's a lot of hash
[SPEAKER_00]: people in America that think like the last
10 or 14 years of sort of like the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolution that's happened over here That
they have the best hash by far that they
[SPEAKER_00]: throw away all the traditional cultures by
far and that they're kind of on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting edge and they've changed the game
and They figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right, which is pretty far from the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, so it's like a lot of
those things where You know, we can we can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of riff on that for a little bit So
maybe you can kind of talk if we can we
[SPEAKER_00]: can start like maybe we'll we'll start
from the beginning where it's like The
[SPEAKER_00]: hash culture sort of comes from the I
would say the the Near East and the Middle
[SPEAKER_00]: East.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say Indian Indian culture
India Chinese maybe yeah, I mean and and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the old probably the oldest way
to smoke cannabis Before they even figured
[SPEAKER_00]: out how to smoke flour besides like
burning flowers on brassieres or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah is the hand rub Yeah, you know and
that India Pakistan Afghanistan Iran the
[SPEAKER_00]: Middle East you can go into like Lebanon
and Israel in those areas and you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through North Africa All the way to
Morocco and that's sort of hash culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right And in terms of like people
grew weed just make to turn weed into
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah where you start getting into like
Southeast Asia And you know and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: the New World like Mexico and Colombia and
Panama And these type of places in Africa,
[SPEAKER_02]: they mostly smoke wheat Yeah, and you know
one that that caught me off guard was
[SPEAKER_02]: Nepal I always think of like Nepalese
temple balls and that kind of hash culture
[SPEAKER_02]: But I if I remember correctly when I was
studying it most of it was a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: culture It was most it was it was a little
bit of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know But you know and so to be
perfectly honest, like when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: going to Amsterdam I went there in search
of seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah you know and then I started getting
introduced to hash and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a bunch of stuff but in the
coffee shops It's a lot like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot like dispensaries or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wide variety Yeah of mids and
junk and really good and pretty decent and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and it wasn't until I met collectors
Yeah, that started explaining to me like
[SPEAKER_00]: how it all worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right and so There's an aspect maybe
we could maybe I could talk for a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: about before We talked about the regional
differences for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe I could talk about like
Something that we chat about often which
[SPEAKER_00]: is the vast difference between how
traditional hash is made and how American
[SPEAKER_00]: hash is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the American hash the way it's made in
most cases is It's it's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called single source, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a single clone right grown in either
depths or outdoor indoor or whatever and
[SPEAKER_00]: that single clone is usually You know
dried or fresh frozen and then it's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's processed And then it's usually
refrigerated or frozen right away or
[SPEAKER_00]: stored well until use and it's used pretty
quickly Yeah, right where in traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: hash culture you're harvesting a field of
seeds Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know in America it's like oh I'm
gonna pull down this greenhouse and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all For lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all the same cut You know same
terpene profile same CBD CBN THC all that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same thing Yeah, but if you're if
you're harvesting it from any other
[SPEAKER_00]: region, you're gonna get the full range of
Expression of that wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they're harvesting thousands
of sisters Yeah, and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: processing those sisters and unlike unlike
mo if you're if you're talking about like
[SPEAKER_00]: dry sift and stuff like that They tend to
let that hash age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah on the plant for a number of months
And then when it's cold and bone dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start a sifting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right and then from that sifting
process you know, then they make it into
[SPEAKER_00]: various grades and Then they press it
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not done in America at all All
of your all of your turpshit all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's fresh frozen or it's you know
BHO or it's it's You know, whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually single source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's not aged Usually the plant
is taken down fresh and as soon as they
[SPEAKER_00]: can make the hash they make the hash Yeah,
right and so, you know, I'm not exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the expert on the science or whatever But
definitely aging it creates, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it transfers things from one to the other
Right certain amounts of CBN or CBD or
[SPEAKER_00]: this or that or whatever is converted into
other bioactives whatnot and then on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of that when We've wanted to get Our buddy
Bodhi on here for a long time to do like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie hashish trail kind of episode Yeah,
and so we might get more in depth with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Essentially when Europeans and
white people first started going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash regions and looking for export Most
hash there was a lot of hash that was one
[SPEAKER_00]: two three years old Yeah, you know a lot
of the best hashish was Smoked until it
[SPEAKER_00]: was over a year or two years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yikes Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's just different climate though
It was stored it was stored very
[SPEAKER_00]: differently, you know, and they just
thought that it was it was not like it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't ready yet Yeah, you know and so and
what's interesting about this is that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to Amsterdam and You have all these
people that have all the same access to
[SPEAKER_00]: all the same tech that we do here yeah,
as far as extracting modern cultivars for
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish and All the hash heads over there
will tell you that the best hash that they
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke is the top import Mm-hmm,
they can use pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use tumblers They can fresh froze
and freeze dry and microplane and do all
[SPEAKER_00]: the tricks that people win awards with
over here Yeah, and they still think that
[SPEAKER_00]: hash is inferior in quality and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the best of the best imports Right
and you know, but in America we all think
[SPEAKER_00]: that our shit is the best shit ever the
worst Basically as soon as we invented the
[SPEAKER_00]: nail and we invented some modern ways of
hash smoking and oh oh nine, you know 2010
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the revolution and hash
went from shitty to amazing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: right now it's true that most Americans
got shitty hash and it's also true that
[SPEAKER_00]: when all these white people and all these
Europeans and all these Americans and
[SPEAKER_00]: Brotherhood of eternal love and all these
assholes started coming to these regions
[SPEAKER_00]: to look for hash and Started offering
crazy amounts of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah quality went way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah People started adulterating people
started middlemen started making it worse
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted volume because there was so
much demand, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times the best stuff never
leaves Yeah, even like even my friends in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam Who are very tied in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Them getting the best of the best is
really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine so and they and they savor
it Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely savor it and they hold on
to it and it never makes the you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost said clubs It never it almost
never makes the the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it's all traded amongst each
other Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all bought and sold that kind of
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of have to know someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's no different than like if you
if For mention him again a boat he gave
[SPEAKER_00]: out some like 14-week amazing sativa You
probably wouldn't be able to buy it from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cookie store Yeah, you'd have to have
a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to have a homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe now maybe but but even someone
even something that takes that long Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Europe, you know, there's there's
still like I have a buddy over there right
[SPEAKER_00]: now that was texting me I want to get Matt
I didn't tell you this but he just bought
[SPEAKER_00]: some CG 13 and some c5 and some and Some
a5 from over there, you know, and those
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, those are 15 16 week strains
Yeah, that's you that's unheard of to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in a dispensary over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's wild But over there,
it's their bread and butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know so you can find that stuff
So the biggest just to reiterate before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get too off track the biggest differences
between American hash and like the best
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional is You know the what I was
Told by the the Amsterdam cruise is like
[SPEAKER_00]: the best stuff is made in traditional
regions But Westerners help them To make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the purity and the process is
amazing Okay, does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So making their technique more purifying
making making sure that the cleanliness,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah technique and all that is
good screens and everything like that and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know people one of the reasons why
people ask this is people asked about
[SPEAKER_00]: Temple balls, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Nepalese temple balls And I will say
that these Nepalese temple balls that I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked from my buddy was some of the best
hash I've ever smoked in my life Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's interesting because a lot of
people over there feel that way yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: right and they feel that like There's
something to the fact that like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff is being grown at six or seven
or eight thousand feet Yeah, right where
[SPEAKER_00]: the air is thinner and there's more UV And
maybe that leads to a different type of
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive or a different type of THC
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh sure You know, and so they would say
that like, you know Our buddy yo Sammy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah would say I don't care what modern
cultivar you have I don't care what
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing cut you think you have or how pure
you make it You know, it shits the bed
[SPEAKER_00]: next to the best temple ball Yeah,
like if you can get the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like just in flavor and effect Yeah,
right and effect is hard to say because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's invisible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so We got used to making all these
modern cultivars and thinking that like
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of years of hash culture We just
beat Yeah, because we're a little cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because we got a little bit better
and we have a little bit we have some
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery and we're a little bit better
process but like Old-timers will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that like they think that putting your
hash in there in the in the fridge ruins
[SPEAKER_00]: it Yeah, and you know what what what's
weird about the Nepalese stuff is I will
[SPEAKER_00]: say that And this isn't a plug on it or
whatever but anything I've ever smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: That smelled like the Mendo perps that I
cracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah had the Mendo perps in it Yeah,
in the sense that like I've never smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: that terpene profile from any other plant
that wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Unless it was related to it in the
sense that like someone bred with it or it
[SPEAKER_00]: was it was an ancestor of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, except these temple balls that I
smoked And they smell when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: burning them they smelled like you were
burning Mendo perps It's interesting now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, does that mean that like the
Mendo P is Nepalese I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but or does it mean that it just
evoked that terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know I can't say but all those
guys over there what's crazy is that All
[SPEAKER_00]: those hash heads over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow all kinds of phenomenal weed and
they sell all that weed To buy the best
[SPEAKER_00]: hash they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know somebody like somebody
like, you know when you were interviewing
[SPEAKER_00]: Kamara and and red, you know, yeah,
I mean he was saying that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he's never even seen Sam skunk
man smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That you know, the the top people
over there are hashishians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, they smoke hash They're
resin farmers make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what they're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're after a resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and so, you know, we could widen that
out for a little bit and talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is like a totally different
tangent or whatever but when Americans
[SPEAKER_00]: started smoking weed we were a flower
culture We were getting weed from Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: and Panama and Jamaica and Colombia and
all these things and we were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: bricked and we were getting you know,
we were getting bricked of this stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: We started blending them with Afghans
because of prohibition, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's super common and Matt can speak
on this too, but Most of the weed smokers
[SPEAKER_00]: back then were very disappointed in the
smoke of the Afghans Yeah, they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really like the high and they didn't
really like the way it burned Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it was so vastly different than
what they were used to Compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to sativas because those sativas
have been have been bred for Smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were bred for they were bred to
be burned as flour Yeah, you know where I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I told this before but there's this
funny story of when Sam Scuntman was in
[SPEAKER_00]: Was in Afghanistan and he was searching
for seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so he was asking these warlords
for seeds for flour You know and they
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at him and they said, you know
smoking flowers for women and slaves
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he had to convince them that he
was a man and he just wanted them so he
[SPEAKER_00]: could grow his own Flour at home and make
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if he pulled out his wiener You
know And they prove it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to them it was like that that was that
was the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flour was a waste product Yeah,
you know peasants and women slaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: women's smoked smoked flour real men's
Smoked hash that was their culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Obviously, you don't care how flour
burns and you don't care how the flour
[SPEAKER_00]: affects you Because you never smoke it in
that culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Americans were the first people
taking all these hash plants and and
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghans and actually wanting to smoke them
Yeah, it hadn't happened before because
[SPEAKER_00]: none of those people back back home where
they were from gave a shit Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can kind of draw a line from
Morocco on the the western part of Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: all throughout North Africa all the way up
through Lebanon and Israel all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: over Iran and into Afghanistan and that's
all hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah right But then once you get to like
Cambodia Thailand That all kind of got
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it flipped into weed smoking and
exporting actual wheat, you know I wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: why I don't know why that one became so
separate, you know, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know You know and you know,
it's like I prefer flour too to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that we need to like
based what what what we think of on what
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghans think But uh, you know,
definitely they um, you know, they just
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that because that was the culture
that they were raised men smoke hash Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and women smoke flour And slaves
I like they weren't good enough for hash
[SPEAKER_00]: women were puffing tough on the flour over
there and You know, and so there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where when I first went over to
Amsterdam I met this guy he's still over
[SPEAKER_00]: there Steve the nose or whatever and I got
introduced to some of this hashish culture
[SPEAKER_00]: and They would show me the best Moroccan
the best Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are amazing temple balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Afghanistan This is from the
Pakistani Highlands and you smoke all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and it's unbelievable Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like he had the best hash collection
I've ever seen in my life and these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even really smoke weed very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had it Yeah, you know, but they
mostly cared about hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny, you know, and they
thought they didn't care what method you
[SPEAKER_00]: used They didn't care what extraction
technique you had All those cuts that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could make hash off of they were inferior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah They were in it was inferior hashish
interesting, you know Yeah, and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we we huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know they So it's really a big
it's really interesting because Americans
[SPEAKER_00]: like until things open up I would say that
99% of Americans have probably never
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked the top import grade of hash that
you can get Yeah, they just haven't seen
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't show up it
gets It barely gets to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah before it gets absorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of people asking about the the
opium thing and I can comment on that real
[SPEAKER_02]: quick what they're referring to is an old
story and It wasn't hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a weed thing It was necessarily
it wasn't necessarily a weed thing The
[SPEAKER_02]: story was that tie sticks were dipped in
something called pasta water, which was
[SPEAKER_02]: the water used when you Produce heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're when you're doing the
conversions from opium to heroin the
[SPEAKER_02]: leftover waters called pasta water so
there was Theories and or people would
[SPEAKER_02]: spread stories that you know, all tie
sticks were dipped in pasta water And
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why they were so strong when in
reality it probably wasn't the case That's
[SPEAKER_02]: not really how how the the water works
drying on to to weed, you know But it that
[SPEAKER_02]: that is stuff forever So that a lot of
people think that tie sticks have heroin
[SPEAKER_02]: in them and that's yeah, that's where that
came from and you know, they don't mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think if it happened it would
have been very rare I mean The reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: is because cartels like that They don't
put more expensive drugs on cheaper ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, never free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how that's not how they
operate, you know I mean, you know now
[SPEAKER_00]: with like the whole fentanyl thing and all
that their people are cutting all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff with highly dangerous substances
Yeah back in the day if anything got cut
[SPEAKER_00]: with anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was by something cheaper and weaker
Yeah, I still am very skeptical on on
[SPEAKER_02]: street fentanyl being cut into normal
things because it's still more Expensive I
[SPEAKER_02]: would imagine then most of the drugs are
saying that it's cut with it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really make sense unless people are trying
to buy Fentanyl and they're cutting it
[SPEAKER_00]: with shit but cheaper I'm gonna I'm gonna
reiterate it one more time just because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's really important is that almost
all traditional hash Regardless of grade
[SPEAKER_00]: or quality is made out of thousands and
thousands and thousands of sister plants
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah grown from seed and so you get a very
wide range of that that strains profile
[SPEAKER_00]: THC CBD CBN trapeze all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all gets blended together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so it's vastly different than
Growing a room or growing a greenhouse of
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO or skittles Yeah, or something along
those lines and taking the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic cut Right, yep and that exact same
genetic cut and and and extracting that
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, it's just very different and the
way they process it is different and how
[SPEAKER_00]: long that it takes them before they think
it's cured into something that they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke is also different so American
hash culture is very new and it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: against the grain as far as like any other
kinds of Hashish culture that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would you would see now it is
true Of course that with with demand,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna mix all cut brokers and and
and people looking for profit are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: mix all kinds of cut into hash Yeah,
I'm talking about the nicest stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the pure grade Yeah,
and hash in these regions was a lot better
[SPEAKER_00]: Before all these white people showed up
demanding tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure And then once all these
Europeans and all these English and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these Americans started showing up on the
hippie hashish trail in the 70s and they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted just Enormous amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They blew through all the best and then of
course just like any other humans You're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get a bunch of people that are
trying to meet demand Yeah, so the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: on average is gonna go way down and you're
gonna get a bunch of B and C grade and
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna get you know,
and then you're gonna get um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the top end is gonna be a lot more
rare Yeah, you know And you know the like
[SPEAKER_00]: I said all those old-timers That smoke
hash they all swear That the best
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional hash is still the best Yeah
now whether that's because of the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: they use whether that's because they dry
farm it, you know I'm sure there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different reasons, but the process
itself is very different yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the effect is very different and they
They all they all swear by and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: they take the best of what they grow You
know and that and people say that Too
[SPEAKER_00]: people say I see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a buddy of mine that was like,
oh, yeah Yeah, yeah, they know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're fucking talking about They fucking
make hash with the same half the hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking wipe their shit on yeah,
right and it's basically like These people
[SPEAKER_00]: these humans that have spent thousands of
years refining their hash culture don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know shit Yeah from what we've learned
since oh wait on yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and American we've gone we've gone
through everybody dabs with a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand Degree glowing cherry red hot
nail or banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah unpurged bh Oh every two or
three years We're like improving our
[SPEAKER_00]: technique and you only have to go back
five or six or seven years to techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit that people wouldn't do again
Yeah, it already get out of style that we
[SPEAKER_00]: learned that a bunch of these terpenes are
like carcinogenic Yeah at the heat that
[SPEAKER_00]: most of these people were dabbing them
Yeah with right and then the other Thing
[SPEAKER_00]: too is when you watch you know You can get
on IG right and you can watch some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these hash cultures work and how they heat
the hash and how they work the hash You
[SPEAKER_00]: know and how they get the hash malleable
and how they get the the resin to be warm
[SPEAKER_00]: before they use it You know, yeah all that
different types of stuff and like and so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot to learn from those people
You know because they've been smoking hash
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time Yeah, you know and like we
you know, we stumble upon all this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and we think We're doing amazing because
you can see through you know, we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it on a piece of parchment paper And
be able to see through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we want to make it off fresh frozen
Harvested fresh frozen put in through this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing put through a freezer dryer all this
different stuff and you know, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy people talking about Frenchy and
stuff like that and he did bring a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of the of of that different culture
into all this, you know, but there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect of You know the the old-timers will
tell you that you would store the hash in
[SPEAKER_00]: like in loose bags Right in a cold spot
and they said if you wanted to ruin your
[SPEAKER_00]: hash you put it in the fridge Yeah,
and and the fridge and the humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: the bullshit would ruin your fucking hash
They were like if you wanted to ruin it
[SPEAKER_00]: just just do that to it But if you put it
into a cold dry cellar and you let it age
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while boom It would get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and You know and so and
they also grow with a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that we're not used to Yeah,
that's very true, too You know And you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and they you know, they grow from
seed every year Yeah, right and we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow from clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, and so we've gotten really
in especially on the West Coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know We've gotten really egotistical
About our hash making yes and about our
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts and we are, you know,
we are doing better I'm not I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that like what we do isn't viable I'm just
saying that like from the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam that have vast experience with
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah They all prefer the traditional shit
if they can get the grade they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure so that should say something
Okay, people are asking the title of the
[SPEAKER_02]: book and someone did point out the turning
app.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe isn't so well liked But this is with
Lawrence Cherniac and Alan Dronkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called How she's the joy of making
and curing it's I was just putting up some
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures to illustrate as we were talking
about how she's the different styles looks
[SPEAKER_02]: Techniques in here, but yeah people used
to sit there and you know, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see my hand or whatever But like
you can they would sit there and rub and
[SPEAKER_00]: rub and work and work and work and really
get the hash warm and malleable sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: people would Put it into a plastic bag and
they would put it in the heel of their
[SPEAKER_00]: shoe Yeah, and they would walk on it to
like work and work and work and they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't just sit there and you'll see
videos on IG now because there's people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going around Afghanistan and
Pakistan and some of these hash cultures
[SPEAKER_00]: Of how before they use it they heat it up
They work it they get it to be they get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of there's a lot of
There's a lot of old techniques that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think are kind of being ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that You know, it's almost like this
shit where like in California in the 70s
[SPEAKER_00]: People knew about red and white wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, that was that that was the
level of knowledge that like red went with
[SPEAKER_00]: with prime rib and meat You know and white
was for their wife and went with fish or
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken or something and that's about all
they knew Yeah, and now you fast forward
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 years or 40 years or whatever and now
it's like they're like Oh Merlot and this
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian and the pinot grease that's
that you know that uh that's that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and And whatnot and you know,
I think the same thing is gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: with hash Yeah, we're a baby hash culture
in America and we don't know shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're learning stuff and every few years
You can see hash culture and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: people's techniques improve Yeah,
right But we could learn a lot from you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and maybe they'll get to a point
like we With the legality of things or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot where you could grow a field Yeah,
like it would be cool for seed makers,
[SPEAKER_00]: right where you could grow a field of of
seeds Yeah, and then harvest the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be awesome And then you
get the full range of whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Matt's bubble berry or or yeah,
you know a Skittles hybrid or a GMO hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever the case may be you'd get the
full range in the hash Instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: like this one Cut I'm gonna concentrate
what's in this one cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because that's never been done
before right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's not typically how it's done over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not typically how it's done over
there And so we have we have our own thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not bad or anything like that I'm
not saying that but it it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very different now we could
expand it out a little bit and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: When when they first started bringing
Afghans, you know, we all started growing
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa in America, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Because sativa seeds came free with
the fucking wheat Yeah, you get kilos of
[SPEAKER_00]: you know headstache brought in everyone
selling it your weed came with free seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we used to sit there in high school
leaning back against the chair and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a we'd have a tray and you'd break up the
weed up here and you'd let all the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and stems roll down and Yep, keep and you
keep your weed up there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But hash didn't come with free seeds Yeah,
yeah, so just watching someone tell a joke
[SPEAKER_00]: about bubble man We so we don't have we
don't we don't we didn't get very many
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know Sativas were all everywhere
everywhere in the 70s and 80s and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily what it all was.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think puck washes?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I think like man, you know If you
wanna if you want if there's people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that don't like me and you want to
think of me as a shitty grower I should
[SPEAKER_00]: show you some pictures of my puck grows
because I did some I did some depths and I
[SPEAKER_00]: did some greenhouse outdoors with it and
Boy, was it not impressive?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't wash it because there would be
no residue wash off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it was it was a really ugly I mean,
I can't say what it looked like in the 80s
[SPEAKER_00]: or in the 90s when it was a little younger
But you know when I got it it hated
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight and food Yeah And you know
strangely enough those were two things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I like to give my plants sunlight and
food at The time so yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was it was really unusual you know and
You know, they uh So there's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash and there's another aspect of
it too where it's like maybe we should we
[SPEAKER_00]: could talk about this for a second is that
Most people most most Americans I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say white people, but most Americans
will say it that way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like we don't like our time is our
time is money Yeah, you know, so you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the way traditional People sift sifting
is an amazing product, but it's the most
[SPEAKER_00]: time-consuming Yeah, and it gets the least
yield So it's the rarest So Americans are
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly looking for can I wash this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I BHO it can I see what what way can I
do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's efficient and I can get an
extraction that yields what it what it how
[SPEAKER_00]: can I get yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well most of the time you have to put that
through a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just knocking the Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah over a screen and getting and getting
dry sift and then putting that dry sift
[SPEAKER_00]: through a series of screens and cleaning
it up like bubble man is as shown Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even water is assault water is the
original solvent That's why it's so funny
[SPEAKER_00]: that people call water solvent list Yeah,
our hash is solvent list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like look put in is water a solvent into
Google and see what comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the original and what's crazy
about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is if you read now granted there's a lot
of there's a there's some THC and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that aren't soluble in
water Yeah, but there is if you read like
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Clark's book hashish about 25% of
terpenes are water soluble Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can so there's times when we did
stuff with water hash, right where You run
[SPEAKER_00]: something like some kind of tangy cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that and that citrus that's
Citrus comes through super strong Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but then you run something like the
56 day headband and it comes out smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: like axle grease Yeah, it's super potent
but it's like chemical process didn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's if the chain that makes up the the
aroma and the taste Yeah, make it through
[SPEAKER_00]: the hash making process Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the stuff we do today whether
it's bh o or whether it's water hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: then frozen or This or that a lot of these
things affect the flavor and a lot of what
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes popular is what keeps its flavor
With the time-saving techniques that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use to make hash extraction easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, I mean you watch you watch
these guys like on IG or whatever Then you
[SPEAKER_00]: see them do their traditional hash thing
No American wants to be sitting there with
[SPEAKER_00]: a face mask on for eight hours a day over
a thing shaking flour and knocking off the
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals And then carefully, you know like
refining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get you enough weight for your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah People we want to use machines Well
that changes it too Yeah right Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and part of the reason why I think like
the tangy and the whole dimension that
[SPEAKER_00]: again the tangy and the whole citrus craze
happened is because when Like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in mid-2000s you couldn't give
away Calio No, no If you had citrus weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a great way for your broker to
look at you and say no dog Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: no dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need that I'm not taking your
weed, you know, but then and it was also
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus weed tends to not be that potent
Yeah, so it's it's you know, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say midsy But you could
say moderately potent at best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah with a flavor people did blank
lacking recreational potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but then You start extracting it
with bh o or this or that or whatever and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden that that Citrus terpene
came through super solid and now the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit's 70% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it actually gets you high Yeah,
and so a lot of the popular strains in
[SPEAKER_00]: America that got made into hash Got made
into hash because after you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: through the the processes that we do to
make life easy Yeah, still taste didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work good You know But the but the old
like the old static tech and the old like
[SPEAKER_00]: and the old sifting tech that was like
used forever That wasn't abandoned because
[SPEAKER_00]: it sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was abandoned because it was lower
yield and took a lot more time Yeah And a
[SPEAKER_00]: man and you know most hash guys like to
make their money quick, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, turn it over I'm gonna turn it over,
you know, and so you get like what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think is the world's most amazing hash The
hash collectors in Europe don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking the world's most amazing
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not that it's not good And
everybody can have their opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yeah, they just have a different
perspective on it and more Man,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to say but more cultured at some
points when it comes to hash specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean, it's one of those things like like
that's why you can compare it to wine
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know it's like now in California
you can have all these wines nerds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are extremely Intelligent about the
different grapes and the different grades
[SPEAKER_00]: and the different Appalachians and where
certain varieties do better than others
[SPEAKER_00]: because a climate Yeah in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was red and white And that's kind of
where we are hashish wise right now We're
[SPEAKER_00]: just learning and like anybody who's
listening right now like, you know Who's
[SPEAKER_00]: made hash for the last 10 or 15 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how much your techniques and
what you've been doing has been changing
[SPEAKER_00]: every year to this whole time It's not
like you've reached the mountaintop You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's like people figure out a way to
do it better and then people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do it that way Yeah,
and a lot of the traditional ash people
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me that most of the modern cultivars
that we grow with suck as far as hash
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction Where you get some yeah where
you get some Lebanese shit or you get some
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepalese stuff that for generations has
been grown just for that and That shit
[SPEAKER_00]: dumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know because that's what they
decide it to do and When when the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution hit 10 12 years ago,
you know People started looking around for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the elites that had been kept around
and do any of these also dump hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah They weren't bred for that No one
ever thought of it Hash was like a you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, hash was like a personal product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe you could get some Keith at a
club Maybe you should get some water hash
[SPEAKER_00]: at a club, you know People would get
scissor hash You know if you were working
[SPEAKER_00]: or people would get finger hash when they
were bucking down stuff and all that But
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't like commoditized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right Did you ever use an ISO 2?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, yeah I want I want one of those to
try out if any of you guys out there have
[SPEAKER_02]: an ISO 2 I would trade you some seeds for
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to use my dad's is like a he-man
Castle along with my group Castle
[SPEAKER_02]: grayskull and shit, but I'd really like to
see how it works today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can probably do a We could
probably do a whole show one time on just
[SPEAKER_00]: the different eras of like oh,
that sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Oh, I'm gonna go on an octagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm gonna grow areoponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm gonna go NFT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm gonna grow this way Oh,
I'm gonna extract that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, you know Coliseums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Coliseums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to Coliseum I mean we could go
through all that of just all like whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: is the most cutting-edge shit imaginable
Yeah, do you remember the V tables that
[SPEAKER_02]: were like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, everyone those popped up
there's a pencil and so it's funny right
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of my friends are
egotistical or whatever You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like the the main you talk to
hash people in California and the West
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast now And they think they're the best
hash people that have ever lived sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they dominate You know, and I'm not
dissing them because they are figuring
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out and they aren't making nice hash
Yeah, right most of our field growers fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also turning their back on
thousands of years of humans learning shit
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know and and it's and it's like
it's like when you're shocked when old
[SPEAKER_00]: people have something to teach you Yeah,
you know, yeah, you know, there's there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's techniques and there's things and
there's aspects You know that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean think about all those classes that
Frenchie did yeah Just you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was and he all he was doing was
just teaching some people how Different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures over there made some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know and people ate it up Yeah,
they did you know and there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor profiles and there might be a way
where you take a cultivar and you extract
[SPEAKER_00]: it one way and it's potent but it sucks
and Then you do it another way and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing So it's not like all strains react
the same like something like I said some
[SPEAKER_00]: things go through water like a champ
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even did shit where I would have like a
greenhouse full of the same strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would have outdoor Yeah,
and like sometimes like the sour diesels
[SPEAKER_00]: and certain things like that if they got
rained on a bunch in October Their terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile wouldn't be exactly what I was
after Yeah But the sour diesel grown 30
[SPEAKER_00]: feet away in a greenhouse that never got
rained on once was Fed with the same food
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same everything would be bomb You
know But like the super silver haze or
[SPEAKER_00]: certain citrus stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't affected by the rain at all
Yeah, it just kept its profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes the rain enough rain would
fuck up the flavor on my weed Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know And Well, you know someone just
said it's potent but it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest oxymoron ever not
really it depends because it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: how it depends on how you What the high is
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean you can quality of high You
can read old high times, right and not to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring up high times, but a lot of people's
opinion of the old Afghani one Was that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a uncomfortable anxiety inducing body
high that gave you heart palpitations And
[SPEAKER_00]: it was one of the least enjoyable smokes
out there Yeah, and they way preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas or normal or NLs or there was lots
of other highs that they liked Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: they thought it was potent but they didn't
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know Some people like some some
people the that sativa buzz that nl5 haze
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz or that nevels haze buzz It's super
potent and it makes them want to crawl out
[SPEAKER_00]: of their skin and jump off a bridge and
die And they'd never smoke it again if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, they hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's like me with skunk one types
They fucking hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the nicest sativa I've ever smoked
but there's people that are smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of times and they'll be like I know
That's a bad time for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know potency is just one aspect It
just means it's strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that it's gonna affect you
in a pleasant way Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally I don't like edibles Yeah,
oh, no, you can't control the high You're
[SPEAKER_00]: in just strapped in because and the reason
why I don't like edibles I'll be perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: honest is that they fuck with my
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: They give me this like, you know when
you're drunk and you're like if I put a
[SPEAKER_00]: foot on the ground I'll stop the spins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they can give me the spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's not like that feeling Yeah,
and I have friends that'll be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh you just got to eat enough and blow
past it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and for me I'm like, well how how
many hours of uncomfortable do I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel before I start feeling good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I like weed a whole bunch
and I don't feel good at all You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so how many hours of my life do I want to
not feel good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know that happens to me enough,
you know So I don't do edibles because
[SPEAKER_00]: like I got kids and shit, you know,
so, you know one of my kids could be Break
[SPEAKER_00]: their toe or whatever and yeah,
it doesn't matter how much weed I've
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked I can hop in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take them to the hospital I can do
whatever I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but if I just ate a couple hundred
milligrams of edibles I might need to like
[SPEAKER_00]: call a lifeline, you know, or I'm not you
know And then yeah, I have all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are gonna start commenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you just need to take these you just
need to eat these I'm just saying yeah for
[SPEAKER_00]: me the way my body works Sometimes it
gives me the spins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And I don't like the spins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people don't understand
that though how how variable the
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's brain chemistry is and how
each individual?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of annoyed or what have you interacts
differently with everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody gets the same effect from
the same clone though, though,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean collectives That's the
way people are tied all all indicus do
[SPEAKER_02]: this also keep us do this all hybrids do
right in the middle, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just It's just it's just not that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I chem 91 is one of my all-time
favorite highs Yeah, it makes me feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a teenager Watching a Mel book Mel
Brooks movie and I got a big thing of
[SPEAKER_00]: popcorn and I'm happy and content and life
is great Yeah, and we have good friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like meh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean, I love what it I love what it what
it breeds like and I understand that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of other people like it But I wouldn't
like to smoke it on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I love it You know, so there's
that aspect too You know and that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one Of the main things that all the hash
guys that experience tell me is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't they just simply can't find the same
effect Yeah, have you tried suppositories
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can assist you if you need help I
know you've got you've got although you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to all those extra jumbo I got that
extra long attachment on the thing to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a release No, yeah, I don't I don't need
any of that kind of stuff I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that for people that have a hard
time in a bunch of nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know I'm not trying to make foot
off the fun off it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be the best way for them to
absorb Yeah, I got a pretty funny pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: funny story about boofing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a friend named Brian He's dead
now, but he had heard that if you booth
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxycontin and granted that we were like 17
18 You heard that if you booth Oxycontin
[SPEAKER_02]: you get really fucked up and this is the
early days Oxycontin So he stuck the
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxycontin up his ass and waited and waited
and then he realized that there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: coating on the outside That it really
won't penetrate through your asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had to crush it up and reinsert it
and do his ass That's my boofing story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I do joke with My friends that are
younger than me, you know that their
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution to drug culture is boofing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That's that really that's what they
that's what they're gonna be remembered
[SPEAKER_00]: for that's their innovation Yeah,
you know all that different types of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, whatever It like I have seen
people making suppositories for very sick
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer patients and AIDS patients and
other various aspects and I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they do a great job But what people also
should know too is that when you eat when
[SPEAKER_00]: you eat weed Or you take it, you know
suppository style it turns into THC 11
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, did you know that no I didn't it
converts into something When you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's 11 THC Delta 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right and It's much longer lasting
You know And so that's kind of why you get
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked like in the sense of like if it if
it hits you the wrong way Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sort of stuck with that feeling for
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so me and Delta 9 are real good
friends Yeah, I don't nine and me we get
[SPEAKER_00]: along we see we see eye to eye on things I
can smoke whatever format even you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I'm more of a flower person than
hash but I can smoke a bunch of hash and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can still accomplish whatever I need to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah 11 hydroxy not Delta that makes
sense.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah 11 hide Maybe I misspoke but but
yeah, it converts in your gut into
[SPEAKER_00]: something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and it's longer lasting and it has
some different effects Well, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't it bind with your fat cells too,
which makes it more potent in your stomach
[SPEAKER_00]: now We're getting into into areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with Yeah, you know,
it's one of those things where I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: care about Edibles that much because I
don't I don't I don't ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that important to me You know,
I do think that they're a great way for
[SPEAKER_00]: some people to get medicine Yeah,
you know, but I got shit to do and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: kids and I can't take myself out Yeah,
yeah, it's a good take yourself out and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know to be honest like in the 90s and
stuff like that, you know Now you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the you can go to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be like, oh, I'm gonna get a five
milligram or a ten milligram or fifty or a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred Milligram, you know, yeah and back
in the day, you know, and you know when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing edibles more It was like is this
ganja goo ball?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I gonna feel anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah all the way up to I'm in my tent and
I can't move Yeah, and I'm missing the
[SPEAKER_00]: festival because I'm horizontal You know,
yeah, okay here just came here just
[SPEAKER_02]: answered He said no crosses the
blood-brain barrier more easily make
[SPEAKER_02]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It converts in the liver not the gut which
totally makes sense Yeah, I knew I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna I knew I was gonna misspeak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that it affected you differently
and it converted differently Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was nervous to talk about the various
science of it because I I wasn't I
[SPEAKER_02]: probably wasn't gonna get there Yeah,
see I'm very Adventurous and I'll talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about the science of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No exactly nothing what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm good at that part I just knew that
it converted differently and it and it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it it lasted longer and it has a different
series of effects Than inhale and then
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking Yeah, I know someone said that
people with diabetes can't feel edibles
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can absolutely disprove that Yeah,
I mean I've been on you know, I've eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: some ganja goo balls at times and stuff
and I definitely I'm not I'm speaking for
[SPEAKER_00]: experience when I was like I'm in the tent
and I can't move I can't stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I gonna pee myself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, can I move?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you know, it's just like
it's just bad dosing Yeah, these six ganja
[SPEAKER_00]: goo balls are almost worthless and you
wasted your money and this one is like
[SPEAKER_00]: catatonic Yeah, you know, do you really
want to be catatonic at a festival?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, no, that's how you get
raped happens Well, no, I mean not that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, but it but it's just yeah You paid
money to be there and now you're laying on
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks on in a tent spinning, you know but
it's just one of those things where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like You know and actually too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's interesting in the sense
that I don't know I don't even know if I
[SPEAKER_00]: should bring this up, but I have it I have
a daughter That's and I have a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: daughters in middle school, right and it's
one of their big issues right now Is
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really think about it taking edibles to
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're easy to to mask An older
brother an older sister or someone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to go and buy them and kick them
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're sour patch kids They're made
in a bunch of attractive ways now like
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were kids The only way you got
edibles is if some degenerate older
[SPEAKER_00]: brother made some brownies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah some shake or something Like that was
able to stink up their whole house or some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah now they can get like these really
attractive much more controllable packages
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna get caught with a lighter
or a pipe or stinking like weed or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that You can just eat like a
10 milligram Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're a lot more prevalent Makes
sense nerds ropes sour patch kids rice
[SPEAKER_00]: crispy treats all kinds of there's an
immense amount of baking and candy and
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit and much more controllable amounts
That I just don't like it and I'm not what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're saying is kids are good customers
None, you know, I just mean that kids kids
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna get access to whatever is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's available in their And it's easy to
smuggle in I mean I remember back in high
[SPEAKER_02]: school they would do like locker raids and
all kinds of shit trying to catch us
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing drugs and We didn't have things
like, you know gummy bears and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you if you took out some of those
gummies If you took out some sour patch
[SPEAKER_00]: kids from a from a an edible thing You got
and you put them in a real sour patch kids
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and took them in your lunchbox or
your thing or backpack How would they
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking know exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah visible at that point, you know But
you know, so I just I just I just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like edibles, you know, I just don't like
edibles but We kind of got off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of got off track there or
whatever, but it's like a big thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some people are into them,
but they say They steal my they steal my
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they steal other people's
equilibrium, but I start Not feeling the
[SPEAKER_00]: right way and then I get hot And when you
get hot and you have the spins,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how fun is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you end up puking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it's not fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know But you know, and I think
it'll probably take like it would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: take like international Freedom where weed
really becomes opened up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah for Americans over here at least to
really start trying like the finest grades
[SPEAKER_00]: of Imported hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see I I see the It the world
opening up and it being so super corporate
[SPEAKER_02]: and hyper illegal that nobody's gonna be
fucking with shit like that You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna be in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll have Those small clubs and all
that shit It'll be just that culture
[SPEAKER_02]: infiltrating everywhere as opposed to
letting the cultures that are there stay
[SPEAKER_02]: there being able to try each other's
cultures Who knows there's money to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made off this shit, you know right now,
you know, you can get you can get Greek
[SPEAKER_00]: olive oil You know, you can get those
Iberian hams that cost $1,800 for the leg
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been dry aged XML You know what
you can't get Thailand races anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very very hard things are
disappearing not just the not just the
[SPEAKER_02]: strains But the cultures are disappearing
with them in some senses and granted
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not a hash culture necessarily But
it just like just like those strains
[SPEAKER_02]: disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's you know, the techniques are
gonna be going with them over time So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know people saying people people are
talking about people pay more for six star
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an aspect where You know,
there's obviously different grades Right
[SPEAKER_00]: But no matter how pure you make it you're
still limited by your starting material
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, are you all getting it from a single
source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it all the same cultivar is all the
same cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting it from a field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting it from a unique you
planted thousands of seeds and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting those females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and and all that and so you
know, there's an aspect there where You
[SPEAKER_00]: know because you're gonna cut hash is
concentrated right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, where you're gonna concentrate what
was in the flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're gonna concentrate the
qualities of that of that THC or that
[SPEAKER_00]: blend or that CBD CBN terpene profile All
that you know, what do they call it
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you know, so you just you're gonna
get a vastly different experience probably
[SPEAKER_00]: from Moroccan from Lebanese to Afghanistan
to Southeast Asian to Sherpa lotto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Right Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a lot of sure blotto and then a lot
of times to people people still like even
[SPEAKER_00]: hash makers right now It's like oh my god,
this is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes off it are amazing,
but it yielded 2% So fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna do it Yeah, right people
want hash dumpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gotta it's gotta be
commercially viable First yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it won't get beyond some small little
circle There might be so there might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: few friends that like wash it and they're
all trading grams amongst each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: all stoked But it won't trickle down to
where the normal person can get it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't a viable amount Exactly,
and I'm not a hash guy that that big or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever But I do know from working in
legal cannabis and stuff like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's Minimum numbers of weight return
that you need to get to make it be viable
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah to pay for your time to pay for the
equipment to pay for the shift work and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the stuff that goes into making hash
So if it doesn't dump enough Regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: how nice it affects you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna get it's gonna get
shifted to the side Yeah, and if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got something that that blows your head
off, but it yields three and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: percent and it's sister plant tastes a
little bit different and Doesn't work as
[SPEAKER_00]: good but yields six percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, six percent is getting run and
washed all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cuz that's making a money You know
so You know, so there's that too where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like the commercial side of it people
might think oh we have the best hash in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world But unless it's commercially
viable, you'll probably never see it
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're growing it washing it and
making it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or in your small circle of friends
and trading it amongst each other just
[SPEAKER_00]: like You know just like before like if you
were growing a 12 or 13 or 14 week plant
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd probably never be able to buy that
in the store Yeah, I wouldn't think so GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably the first thing that came out
that took 12 weeks That people were
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to jump on Yeah, that always
shocked me especially them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies Well part of the reason part of
the reason why I think people were willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to jump on it was because even though it
took two weeks Four weeks longer than they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted or three weeks longer than they
wanted it dumped like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And it tested super high and it
smelled like Kim D and Kim D was not
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere Yeah, so it like so,
you know there so the yield made it worth
[SPEAKER_00]: it Yeah, right where if the yield doesn't
make the extra time worth that I mean Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: and I joke that like I mean There's some
pretty famous breeders out there that are
[SPEAKER_00]: like if it if it takes any longer than 63
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucked Yeah, or I'm harvesting it
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got this banger Colombian and
it takes 11 weeks But I don't take it
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than 63 days because it doesn't fit
my model Yeah You know That's kind of how
[SPEAKER_00]: that rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and American way the American well,
it's just it's it's there's a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between quality and commercial Yeah,
and that's what I mean too about about
[SPEAKER_00]: like for instance the the wine industry is
now there's enough education in the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that a Certain seven or eight
year old cabernet from a certain winery in
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain region You can get that extra
ducats to make that a viable product right
[SPEAKER_00]: now cannabis doesn't have enough of that
separation To make the rare and the cool
[SPEAKER_00]: and the expensive worth it Right,
there's all there's like this range that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's working in and we haven't
gotten educated enough that you could be
[SPEAKER_00]: like You should pay more for this weed
because it's Neville's haze and it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 weeks and you know, it does this
Eventually, you'll have people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to throw down for that Yeah,
right right now you don't Right right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's it's you don't you know And
so until you get that level of education
[SPEAKER_00]: until you get that consumer willing to pay
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly think like the reason why
People are gonna yell at me for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think the reason why freaking haze
did so well in New York, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was because there was there was Musicians
and rich people and Wall Street brokers to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it to yeah, they Could they could
sell them a higher grade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, straight up just like that,
you know I mean, do you think Kush would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been so popular in in LA if it wasn't
7200 a pound wholesale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No never it was a bit where where it
became massive because in LA it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is expensive and exclusive and
it's not in your bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then people wanted what the with
what people had Yeah, right and people
[SPEAKER_00]: were willing to pay a shit ton for it But
we really haven't gotten there with weed
[SPEAKER_00]: yet too much There's individual things
that break through here and there but we
[SPEAKER_00]: really haven't gotten the criteria as to
like why This weed or why this hash is
[SPEAKER_00]: nicer and should be more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know You know, I mean I even saw
there was there was some shit I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember what it was like, you know,
I see that you know chimeras on here He
[SPEAKER_00]: was talking earlier this week about he's
got RKS that he doesn't want to release
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's got unique traits in it that
he wants to utilize later Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he doesn't think the market's ready
for it Whatever those traits might be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know And that could be that could be
true, too There's lots of times the market
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't ready for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been very good at being At the
forefront of stuff and absolutely making
[SPEAKER_02]: no sales being at the forefront of stuff
and watching others come and clean up with
[SPEAKER_02]: it It's just about hitting it at the right
time when the markets ready for something
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we talked about that before to like
all that superdog work that me and my and
[SPEAKER_00]: my homie did, you know Yeah, that was like
years before American seed sellers could
[SPEAKER_00]: really get a toehold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had no place for it to go Yeah
You know, we had no place for it to go You
[SPEAKER_00]: know so You know, it's it's got to be the
right it's got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a balance between
commercially viable mm-hmm and fire Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to match You know, so I don't
know right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we've been in we went to war
with Afghanistan for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably not the it's probably not
the best time to go over there as a white
[SPEAKER_00]: guy and Start looking around for hashish
and and rare things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah, you get Taliban or
whatever but you know, but But they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a real culture over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have a real vibrant hashish
Culture and it's just separated from us,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's always a trip to me with it
with how how Religiously conservative
[SPEAKER_02]: those areas are but there still is a
breeding culture or a weed culture there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know It is so counter to the Muslim
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Just you know, it's like I think it's
one of those things where it's like it
[SPEAKER_00]: predated You know predated the that whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just it's it's you know,
it's just kind of like how you know Like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's any number of different
things where like Christianity just
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed certain pagan rituals into itself
Oh, yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good because they because they couldn't
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they co-opted it Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you want to bring you want to
bring Allah to Afghanistan you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to incorporate some hashish Yeah,
because it's ancient there and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid Yeah, should have done that with
Christians.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean well, you know they I mean
they it Just it just didn't it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It all honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, like it's an accident You
know and you know, they probably didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize how much effect they were gonna
have a thousand years later or two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand years later I'm sure and in that
regard, you know, yeah so But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean hash You know the the hash in
America is moving along really quickly and
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could go back to to maybe I will
sometime and go back and And talk in
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland and stuff like that and see what
what they have right now is their best
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff Yeah, that'd be interesting to know
and just how it affects you Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz that's what they all talk about is the
the flavor and the effect is just on on
[SPEAKER_00]: you Just can't you just can't get it in
other shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be the judge of that shit You know,
yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But and they also even back when I
was going back there a bunch it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: they would grab You know, like,
you know a certain amount of kilos would
[SPEAKER_00]: hit Amsterdam and it would all get bought
up by collectors And then they all sit on
[SPEAKER_00]: it and hope that they didn't run out
before they found something else of that
[SPEAKER_00]: quality Yeah, and so they'd have a chunk
of this and a chunk of this and a chunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you know So on and so forth and
whatnot And that's what you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd they'd smoke they'd smoke they'd
almost keep flour for the Americans Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they'd show you and then they'd
show you what they really were we're into
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah in that regard, you know and you
know, and so you know, we're we I Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know maybe maybe there's a there's an
aspect of America where we blend we
[SPEAKER_00]: blended a bunch of the smoking weed With a
bunch of the hashish weed What do you mean
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of create huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know We took stuff that was bred
for smoking like Thai our Colombian and
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mexican and things of that nature and
then we blended it with all this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that was Specifically designed for
hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Like all the Afghans that came over
originally Yeah, that was all bred
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively for they didn't they weren't
going for like does this flower taste
[SPEAKER_00]: good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they never tasted the flower Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they hashed it But the hash had to
taste have a taste of its own,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but it's different it's
different when you're burning aged hash
[SPEAKER_00]: That's versus versus like a bunch of
flower material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know And so we started figuring
all that out and we started blending it
[SPEAKER_00]: with sativas and blending it with
different things and trying to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: they all came out Yeah, you know,
it's weird in the sense that like America
[SPEAKER_00]: and Holland sort of became the two places
I should say Canada too North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sort of became where like all the
various regions of weed started blending
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could probably put Australia in
that category Sounds like it sounds like I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a lot of familiarity with over
there but like it sounds like Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: was another melting pot where they got a
bunch of Southeast Asian weed and they got
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of They got a bunch of Indians
Indian and Afghanistan and Pakistan and
[SPEAKER_00]: blends of different stuff, you know yeah,
and whatnot and so You know it and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was people too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could switch we could switch
bases for a second There was people that
[SPEAKER_00]: were asking which is more Matt's world
than mine I can let him talk for a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: about what the what the internet what the
seed market is like outside of us Like
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of us outside of our like little
STS reversals Like what everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this guy's dropping caps dropping
something Matt's dropping something CSI
[SPEAKER_00]: has a drop here comes these people,
you know, cuz we're used to like very
[SPEAKER_00]: small scale You know like and I think
probably most people think of the last ten
[SPEAKER_00]: years as what's normal Yeah, but that's
not I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's not really what's out But
you know, obviously like so maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: could talk for a minute about like what
what is it like out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're like so like someone like my
mirror that's been around before me He's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have a different experience than
when I entered when I entered in you had
[SPEAKER_02]: to fuck with Europeans Or your seeds
weren't gonna sell, you know If you
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't fucking with the European seed
bank and we're trying to do direct you had
[SPEAKER_02]: a very very small chance of getting any
Meaningful sells because people wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy from seed banks seed banks were known
There wasn't a lot of places to do
[SPEAKER_02]: exchanges You could always you know do it
get down in the DMS on different forums
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff But that was that was really not
cool like it wasn't looked at as a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to do by the the forum onus because
they were they were kind of taking a some
[SPEAKER_02]: risk for your exchange even though it was
done in the DMS is still on their server
[SPEAKER_02]: and transaction so it wasn't looked upon
positively by a lot of the the Forum
[SPEAKER_02]: owners for anybody to be doing any
exchanges of any sorts and usually you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: get banned from places for doing anything
of the sort so we were we were mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: counting on when I entered in it just
started the British and Attitude wasn't a
[SPEAKER_02]: thing when I first started But yeah,
most of it was outside of the u.s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think heaven stairway was was that
Canada that your us I?
[SPEAKER_02]: think Canada Think it was Canada Canada
believe is it Canada where Calrissian was
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so yeah, I mean You had the
Canadian seed banks a lot of them wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up American folks I remember Med user
Chris over At wood horse seeds he was
[SPEAKER_02]: really not friendly to most Americans hemp
depot Was around, but you still had a hard
[SPEAKER_02]: time getting them to pick up most
Americans so being an American you had the
[SPEAKER_02]: choice mostly of British or if you were
lucky like a Dutch seed bank would pick
[SPEAKER_02]: you up, but yeah, it's It was minimal a
lot of it like when when I got booted off
[SPEAKER_02]: the attitude Subcool had asked it
basically gave that given them a Ultimatum
[SPEAKER_02]: me or him and at the time there was just
me and him that were the Americans on
[SPEAKER_02]: there when I left the attitude and
unceremoniously left I Had to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: was I gonna do is I gonna take the risk be
the one American trying to sell direct or
[SPEAKER_02]: was I gonna just find another seed bank
and get fucked so first thing I did was
[SPEAKER_02]: try to operate a seed bank with a few
other Americans and Unfortunately chose
[SPEAKER_02]: the brothel brothers who were notorious
scammers, and they got me And eventually I
[SPEAKER_02]: just learned fuck I got to do this myself
or it's it's not gonna work and from there
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I mean you could be operating
great in the US But if you weren't taking
[SPEAKER_02]: credit cards like the Europeans Then you
just weren't gonna be any sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: competition and those were always gonna
get the the sales Nowadays it's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: different nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all sorts of direct buying
Instagram kind of changed a lot You know
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram made everyone a lot more
accessible seeds were a lot easier to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: because people weren't As interested in
effect they were more interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: learning by looking you know oh,
that's pretty that look that looks dank
[SPEAKER_02]: became a real catchphrase during Instagram
that looks dank, but I mean back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day We kind of knew that looks didn't mean
anything when it came to date this I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: the weird thing let me interject for a
second because I'm saying stuff in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments is that America was an enormous
seed market Yes, but everyone that tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with America Typically got in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So everyone in Europe, you know when
they saw what happened in Neville yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the super sativa seed club just shut down
and a lot of you know seed banks became
[SPEAKER_00]: very hesitant to ship stuff to America
yeah, and then Canadian seed banks sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: took over that that role for a minute and
Started being willing to ship stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: America And a lot of times they sort of
like took the reins from Europe because
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe would send it to Canada Yeah,
you know and it would get and it would get
[SPEAKER_00]: filtered through But as you know Camaro
was mentioning a few minutes ago Heaven's
[SPEAKER_00]: Stairway went down because there was an
intercepted shipment to the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: and that got cannabis world and overgrow
shut down at the same time and well and we
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna do a full episode on this me
and flan, but it's we're gonna go into
[SPEAKER_02]: detail on Cilpro Heaven's Stairway
Overgrow IC mag and how they were all
[SPEAKER_02]: related in the big bust and this is over a
period of several Years on what I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's that people are still being
prosecuted from one major fuck-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Why I used to go to Amsterdam to buy
seed in the 90s was because that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: most reliable way to get it Getting it
shipped over was very difficult You know
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of people wouldn't do it Mark
Emory who had you know cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine And all that and he had his whole
seed company He ended up doing I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know five ish years or something like that
in America in prison for seed sales So
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a big issue with America's this
voracious seed market But how do you get
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds there without getting in trouble?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and So, you know there wasn't you
know people on IG now you can see all
[SPEAKER_00]: these things and that's why I was joking
about You know, oh this guy's got a drop
[SPEAKER_00]: coming, you know when 20 years ago or
whatever when I was doing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding work There was no outlet to get
that to anyone Yeah, there was no way to
[SPEAKER_00]: advertise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way to set up shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way to I mean even like
somebody like DJ short who Ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: working with a bunch of Canadians Part of
the reason why he worked with so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people was that in order for his sweet his
stuff to get out there He had to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony from sag Martha first Yeah,
and then he ended up working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch passion crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Hank and Dutch passion and he ended
up not liking that and then he ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: working with various people up in Canada
But he had to work with third parties
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was no way for him to safely
distribute Advertise and communicate with
[SPEAKER_00]: people from America to get seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it really wasn't until social
media exploded and IG exploded and
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition 215 and medical started
spreading enough that it started calming
[SPEAKER_00]: down Yeah, all these seed companies like,
you know, think about all the popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know cap or or you know swamp Boys or
these people are you know cookie anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all these people came up and their
possibilities started in the social media
[SPEAKER_00]: IG Yeah, so what Matt's talking about is
how difficult it was as an American seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder to even find a home That could
that could be a middleman That could get
[SPEAKER_00]: they could get your seeds out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know my buddy That that I he
doesn't like to be mentioned but my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: I call Staten Island he kept talking about
like the potential for seeds and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: totally dismissive Yeah, right and we were
both right Right at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was right Yeah, but he saw ten or
fifteen years down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know he did he he saw it but it
just wasn't there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember making that that shift from
cash cropping I mean, it's a very Clear
[SPEAKER_02]: memory for me when I had to make that
choice of fuck I can cash crop or I can
[SPEAKER_02]: make seeds I'm learning I cannot do both,
you know and having to make something that
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I know I can make enough money to
survive Growing Tinsamia That's not what I
[SPEAKER_02]: love to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that way that did that slowly was
not my passion anymore my passion was
[SPEAKER_02]: making seeds and and learning what I could
create, you know, what could be created in
[SPEAKER_02]: these rooms and Having to make that
decision to only go to seed was a tough
[SPEAKER_02]: one because at the time they it was very
risky There wasn't a lot of money in seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean granted greenhouses killing it DNA
was killing it but Americans just weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: killing it at that level yet I mean DNA we
can talk about DNA for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two Americans Plumber in the
stunt cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they you know They went to
Humboldt and Mendo and all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: places and they gathered up a bunch of
seed and a bunch of clones from various
[SPEAKER_00]: friends But they had to go to Holland to
make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was no there was no in the
early 2000s There was no way they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do an American based seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would they even get a hold of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how would you get a hold of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you not get busted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it was it wasn't it wasn't
very easy And so we basically worked first
[SPEAKER_00]: through Holland and that's kind of why
Holland became the epicenter Was it
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right Neville got lucky because he
had balls and a bunch of American breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: were fleeing prosecution in America and
bringing him stuff Right and you know He
[SPEAKER_00]: got stuff from from Greg and he got stuff
from Sam skunk man and he got and he got
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff through Mel Frank and Jorge
Cervantes And he got stuff from Jim Ortega
[SPEAKER_00]: all these people You know because that was
the place that it could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then when Canada became the
place it could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it all went And then when
California and Oregon and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: started being the place that it could go
that's where it went Yeah, and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks because there's this artificial line
between America and Canada That sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: kept our two cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made it a lot more difficult to Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna lie between 2007 and 2010
the fact that it was such a small market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking killer You didn't have all
kinds of competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the the best competition I have Was
like swerve and sub at the time and
[SPEAKER_02]: rascal, you know for Americans and rascal
was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was at the top of the the food chain
when it came to reversals, but I mean Sub
[SPEAKER_02]: and swerve, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean there's there's there's an
aspect of it, but it's like that You know
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that like people don't
realize how long it took to get to get
[SPEAKER_00]: democracy where some guy in a garage could
have a 15 lighter or two or three four
[SPEAKER_00]: lighters or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And make some breeding and do a drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and advertise the drop and let and
let everyone know That it was coming You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I was just thinking about something
as far as drops go like I remember when
[SPEAKER_02]: that was a looked at very negatively if
you're gonna do a Drop meaning can hit one
[SPEAKER_02]: male to more than five or six plants You
were a shitty Paul and chucker and that
[SPEAKER_02]: was like a mark of shame like drops were
not a thing and now that's the common
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted way this Clown or this male
crossed X amount of clones and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted way But back in the day that was
not you were not looked at favorably.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I did So I'm not
looking down on anyone for doing it I was
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the people looked down on not for
doing those I mean we talked about it
[SPEAKER_00]: before but you know 12 or 14 years ago the
four or five guys Doing reversals were
[SPEAKER_00]: looked upon as cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's cheating You're ruining the
fucking you are ruining genetics for good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ruining the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're eliminating male You're taking
shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing this fucked up thing that
shouldn't be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to do shortcuts to make a
quick buck Yeah, and it went from that and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was you know, I don't know Emory is a
douchebag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people agree He's a cunt that
he is a he is a not and he is not a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: person Yeah, by any means, you know,
I mean but you know, there's a there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people that you know, you get some
No, I'm in weed and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's not a good kisser But yeah,
but there's an aspect where it's like like
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: it was it was Matt and rascal and Hybe and
A couple other a couple other people doing
[SPEAKER_00]: reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it was a sea of male female
breeding Yeah, and now fast forward 12
[SPEAKER_00]: years and it's completely reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like 98% femmes and 2% of
people doing reggae Breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's rare to see people do I've got
a reg seed line drop You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's really weird too for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't do that many Femseed runs
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't even though I sell the
spray and I've been doing it a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: people associate me with that I I don't do
them often I don't do them very often at
[SPEAKER_02]: all and I prefer regular seed breeding
because it's so much easier it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking free pass to not fail and Yeah,
it's it's it's a totally different than
[SPEAKER_02]: people's ideas Of what fem breeding is and
how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's regular breeding is easy in the sense
of Getting actual successful pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with real nation with real not not
that you're gonna achieve your goals
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still the breeding is still a lot
of there's still a lot of dead ends and
[SPEAKER_00]: failure in my opinion and sure You know
and all that but but you know feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding even even getting pollen and
getting viable pollen You know Perhaps you
[SPEAKER_00]: would it's a craps you people are saying
don't do the markets telling breeders what
[SPEAKER_00]: they want No, I don't necessarily I don't
think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that finding males is a bunch of
work and People started doing things where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't get either one of these two
elite cuttings, but I'll give you a hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: of them Yeah, you can't get TK by skittles
Yeah, you know you can't get either cut
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can buy a hybrid from me and I
think that's what started it and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's like people buy what's
available you know and you know Reversals
[SPEAKER_00]: just you just took an elite cut and you
crossed it to another elite You took an
[SPEAKER_00]: elite cut and you threw that on 15 or 20
other cuts and boom you've got a seed drop
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and reversals actually really killed
the the wine breeding You know companies
[SPEAKER_00]: used that we were gonna talk about Simon
today tonight, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're gonna talk about serious a
little bit or whatever a serious They
[SPEAKER_00]: offered the same six lines for like
fucking 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah 20 years, you know Sensei seed bank,
you know when Neville was there whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: probably that Matt and I were looking at a
bunch of the catalogs They barely offered
[SPEAKER_00]: a new line for five or six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was the same-ass shit and then in
the late 90s They added two or three more
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They expected you to work on your line and
refine it hopefully and You have those
[SPEAKER_00]: flagship strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, make those lines better over time
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally like I did this reversal I
got X amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're here until they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably won't make them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it a name Yeah, you know,
but That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't you can't hit up, you know You
could hit up serious seeds throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s and you could get AK 47 and you could
get white Russian and you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic and you could get bubblegum and
you could get You know Whatever right and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just on all that was just available
So let me let me use this point actually
[SPEAKER_02]: to tell a story and you'll like this story
because it it has something to do with you
[SPEAKER_02]: so I Gave not so some seeds a while back
and I I was probably I remembered what I
[SPEAKER_02]: gave him, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I gave him an old pack of AK 47
and I was like man When's he gonna pop
[SPEAKER_02]: those motherfuckers and I would bust his
balls over it like man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's those AK 47 get him?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I don't know what you're
talking about I'm like fucking not so
[SPEAKER_02]: right so I bust his balls for at least a
year and a half two years every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: lost his fucking ancient seeds I'm the
seed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk up a K like crazy all this
different stuff He sends them to me Not
[SPEAKER_00]: only do I not do anything with them But I
fuck him over by like not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking them or like you won't crack them
I just fucking ignored him and then I lost
[SPEAKER_00]: them and I keep telling them I don't have
them Yeah over and over again and I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave you these fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuck so anyways, I was busting his
balls about him again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably I don't know a month ago Yeah,
I know something like that not that long
[SPEAKER_02]: and so when I hadn't talked to you for a
long time skunk tech hits him up and is
[SPEAKER_02]: like hey, you know, I haven't talked to
Matt but let him know that I have to those
[SPEAKER_00]: AK 47 seeds he gave me so happy to cuz I
gave that up and I was like you're a dick
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, you gave him to someone else and
fucked me and told me that I fucking lost
[SPEAKER_00]: them and I didn't remember and I'm a
stoner and Yeah, yeah, you know you said I
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me rare shit from the 90s and I blew
it off Yeah, but in fairness you still
[SPEAKER_00]: does have super skunk and nevels haze over
there but you know, there's a there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I mean in fairness to me Before 2017
there wasn't like biblical fires every
[SPEAKER_00]: year in my area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And so that that ruined a number of
seed crops for me and gave me kind of some
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD and all that do it but yeah,
I mean going back to Going back to Simon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, can you imagine if you know,
whoever, you know for the last five years
[SPEAKER_00]: The Swamp Boys have offered the same six
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Matt's offered the same six lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kayla CSI offered the same 20 and they
just remake them and that's what people
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing Yeah, and you get you're
expected to work on all those lines and
[SPEAKER_00]: improve them But you can because you're
only offering half a dozen Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: now every seed drop is like fucking 20
things Yeah, at least usually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and they're all given a name and
they're all given packaging and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all given this and they're all sold and
that's that that's that and you're likely
[SPEAKER_00]: never see them again because the person's
not gonna remake them and Honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the person the fucking the person isn't
even usually growing them out anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah You know, so I will say just just to
finish the story I will give skunk tech
[SPEAKER_02]: some major props.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't even have to tell me that he had
those he didn't have to tell me that he
[SPEAKER_02]: did selections and Made more and he
certainly didn't have to tell not so to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure I get them, you know Or make
sure I know about them to get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So props to him for doing that I was I was
I was pretty fucking cool and there are
[SPEAKER_02]: AK-47 F2 somewhere and they're based on
the cherry stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool, too What's sad about it is
that in 1999 they changed the laws in
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland in Amsterdam and I should say the
Netherlands really because only two
[SPEAKER_00]: provinces Are are are Holland but in the
Netherlands they changed the seed laws
[SPEAKER_00]: where before seed making was legal and
They changed it to being illegal and most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the big producers in in the Netherlands
got busted within a year or two of that
[SPEAKER_00]: change Yeah, and a lot of seed strains and
a lot of wines that were available
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the 90s Then changed because
parents were lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes being Dutch I'm not trying to be
Racist is the wrong word or whatever but
[SPEAKER_00]: just culturally the Dutch are businessmen
and they won't admit that they lost
[SPEAKER_00]: anything ever Yeah, so if you ask Ben or
Alan drunkers, they'll tell you they have
[SPEAKER_00]: all the same breeding parents that they've
had since the 90s Yeah, but we know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not the case and it apparently Simon
admitted that he lost a couple of breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: parents in his raid and Kali missed and
AK-47 were not the same after yeah We
[SPEAKER_00]: should also it should also be said and
this is super fucking annoying for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: right but that Neville and S super sativa
seed club kind of came first, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just told you where they were what
they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they didn't have competition,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville was like, oh I got this NL from
this person and I got this from this to
[SPEAKER_00]: this and I crossed them and I called it NL
by this Yeah, right and and he gave you a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch Of information on lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can go through we've done it
before but you can go through and most of
[SPEAKER_00]: where Neville got his stuff We know the
name of the person that gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where he got it We know if he got
it as a seed line or if he got it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we know all that shit I like Simon
and Simon was really nice to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't fucking know what's in AK-47
Yeah, I don't know exactly what's in Kali
[SPEAKER_00]: missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hunting for 25 30 Years what the
lineage on that stuff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and all the second wave of breeders
that came out Sag Martha Syria seeds TH
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know What's his name Luke from
paradise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, what's in sensi star?
[SPEAKER_00]: God only knows what's in what they all
started hiding Yeah, they hid where they
[SPEAKER_00]: got it from who they got it from what the
mix was in right and so it started This
[SPEAKER_00]: massive guessing game of I love AK-47
Yeah, I have no idea what's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Would love for Simon to one day be like
I'm old and I'm just down to to say you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I one thing I will say that's
also interesting is from that old pack of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and I believe they were sold it
Simon said according to the number on it
[SPEAKER_02]: They were sold in 2000 which meant they
could have been made in 98 99 What was
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting was that the cherry,
you know was supposedly popping up when we
[SPEAKER_02]: Say one in five hundred or one in a
thousand something a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took a lot to find it in the three
seeds that popped Out of ten from this old
[SPEAKER_02]: pack two were cherry So I wonder if
there's some sort of like Viking in it
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was a very cherry line floating
around Amsterdam at the time that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people are using But that's the first
thing that makes me think that and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could you know That that something that
I didn't know that it wasn't lost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bus that Simon's ex-wife killed them
killed a couple plants out of spite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh It was it was it's common knowledge
that he lost them and I mean, I always
[SPEAKER_00]: heard that he lost them Yeah, but you
know, I assumed it was in the bust and he
[SPEAKER_00]: admitted that he lost one parent But he
never admitted that he lost more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he would just never give up the
mix Yeah, he just never knew that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: another thing that also really confused me
is that I Don't understand why they would
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted a lot of them were trying to steal
each other's clones and steal each other's
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds or whatever But if they were
breeders, they would know that how
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions in cannabis work, you know So
they probably like I would think that they
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't be focused too much on well We
can't tell them the name or the the line
[SPEAKER_02]: this came from because they'll get the
same thing and no one as you're aware
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's opinion was they stole most of
it from him and didn't want to give him
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking credit Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he thought everything is his though.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what I'm not saying it is I'm
not saying it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but for whatever reason You know
like yeah, what's in chronic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's what's what's Kali missed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in chronic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's what's a k-47?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, where do you get the parents who
gave him the parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know All that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, they've never come out and
say and those things came out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-90s Yeah, so we're talking 25 years
plus of him being secretive Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and yet Neville had an ego and he
thought the whole fucking scene was based
[SPEAKER_00]: on his shit Yeah, and some of it was but
some of it was his ego, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think you renamed Afghani one I
mean, I know you do I'm always I'm always
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna push that theory and it's based on
nothing, but I'm still gonna push it just
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz I can I mean one of the things that I
learned about Someone just asked what I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in Kali missed I was told by some
guys in Amsterdam that You know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant was this thing called the
mango And it was made by this guy that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to name his name or whatever
But it was he was the guy that came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and that was at least half of it
and I see people You know, there's people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk about whatever but I mean the
thing is is that When I went over there
[SPEAKER_00]: and when I started going over there in the
mid 90s There was already a bunch of dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: that were middle-aged that all Had beef
with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and obviously Neville and Sam had a
bunch of beef with one another and they
[SPEAKER_00]: sniped at each other for years And so
there's an aspect there's an aspect to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like sometimes people just
didn't want to give other people credit
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they didn't want it to come from
them Yeah, you know, they didn't want it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want it They didn't want to be
like, oh, well, I got that from home Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: cuz homie was addicted them and their
mind, you know, yeah, then they had beef
[SPEAKER_00]: and so then There was politics you can
look at the politics of 90s Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can fast-forward 30 years and it goes
on today in California Yeah, it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: common This is one of the old pictures of
Afghani one that has a lot of similar
[SPEAKER_02]: traits to what you will see in things like
Super skunk or even chem 91 and that's one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the the things that originally put me
onto that and Seeing and the LA AFI cut
[SPEAKER_02]: that we had that was a Afghani number one
selection homie just said Kali mist was
[SPEAKER_00]: originally called Western winds Western
winds was one of my favorite all-time
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis names and Bodhi in Cambodians.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they said, but I don't fucking
know it's Supposedly when they were at
[SPEAKER_00]: cerebral together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, they broke off Tony called his
version Western winds and Simon called his
[SPEAKER_00]: Kali missed but they were the same thing
Yeah, they were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean maybe they maybe they made
different breeding selections or choices,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were the same the same origin for
the most part I will say Tony Tony has
[SPEAKER_02]: been ridiculously transparent and open
with me when it comes to asking any
[SPEAKER_02]: questions He's the only Dutch dude who had
a seed bank from back then that never like
[SPEAKER_02]: flinches when I ask him something he's
always been super open even if it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: like Even if he doesn't know the answer
he'll tell you well, I don't really know
[SPEAKER_02]: this came I bought it in bulk from XYZ and
that's what it is and that's all we know
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been really fucking cool about it So
I got to give props to him for that You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I mean maybe maybe he would say what
it was But maybe if it came from Simon or
[SPEAKER_00]: he had be for some guy he didn't like he
wouldn't say it Yeah, cuz that goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: today like people don't want to give other
people credit if they don't like the
[SPEAKER_00]: person You know, they feel like they got
jacked on a I mean even like somebody like
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam like if it wasn't for Mel Frank I
don't you know talking about it years
[SPEAKER_00]: later You wouldn't know that Afghani won
and Durban poison came through Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he gave him to Sam Yeah,
you know Sam showed up in Amsterdam with
[SPEAKER_00]: him, you know, yeah and You know and then
you know Tony Tony has you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then once a line splits Maybe
different breeders make different
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they lean it towards one direction
or another You know, they blame with Adam
[SPEAKER_02]: Dunn and and the bubblegum and like the
different ways Simon worked bubblegum
[SPEAKER_00]: supposedly and all that Yeah, I mean,
I know that I know I you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't I didn't know until tonight that
Simon's X or whatever killed killed the
[SPEAKER_00]: cut but Simon's Kali missed in the 90s was
much more sativa leaning and then around
[SPEAKER_00]: 99 2000 it got shorter and thicker and
more more Indica more Afghan and It lost
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the ethereal qualities that I
liked a bunch about it You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one that I'd really like to
reproduce and we have the old seats to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it But I just it's one of those ones that
like I'd spend money and time reproducing
[SPEAKER_02]: it and they would just sit there You know
and nobody grew it because Kelly missed
[SPEAKER_02]: really isn't one that people talk about
You know the average for still in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there's Finos in Western winds
and you can look in Western winds and Kali
[SPEAKER_00]: missed especially in like some mid to late
90s high times cannabis cups like the
[SPEAKER_00]: glossy pictures they would have in those
in those things and You know and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they there's there those are really
nice, you know, yeah and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, then then he comes out and says
it's kind of true I don't mean that like
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam took a bunch of credit for it I just
mean that it was like in the list of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that that Mel that you know that he
brought to Amsterdam Yeah, and he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously say well I got these two things
from these guys and I got these from these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys and here's the three Hayes brothers
names that I got these seats like You know
[SPEAKER_00]: sketchy back then that's you still can't
get that shit out of him You still can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get that out of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I don't tell me is that I'm wrong
about the Acer you won't tell me what One
[SPEAKER_02]: day, you know one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean, it's one thing about weed is that
people are opinionated Yes, and it takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain kind of person to take the risks
that we all we all take and the various
[SPEAKER_00]: things that go on and You know,
we get beef, you know, yeah and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and so But it's it's also true that
a lot of weed is a flash in the pan So
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it might be around for two or three
years Four years five years and then all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden it's gone or it's not there in
the same It's not there in the same in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same category anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't exist And there's some
there's some really good versions of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cave that still float around There was an
AK in Colorado that our good buddy working
[SPEAKER_00]: man and I talk about all the time That was
a huge yielding beast of a sativa And it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled exactly like sandalwood did pure
sandalwood turps Matt worked with an AK
[SPEAKER_00]: version that had strong Cherry liqueur
cherry and then lemon I had a lemon one,
[SPEAKER_02]: too That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had the RC Cola fino They used
to go around skunk magazine and it smelled
[SPEAKER_02]: like flat cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was pretty uncanny So that
that's a pretty wide turp range in the AK
[SPEAKER_00]: line and an interesting and unique turps
And a lot of them had some pretty god some
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good highs with them, too You know,
so that was a really Simon didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of strains But you know the only the
only strain that I think he had there was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually Absolute bunk and I apologize if
you hear this Simon is chronic Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out a bunch of chronic and it was
big and midsy and ugly and I never found
[SPEAKER_00]: anything worthwhile in it But yeah his
bubblegum and his AK and his white Russian
[SPEAKER_00]: and his Cali mist and all that that was
all real nice weed I think white Russian
[SPEAKER_00]: is totally underrated to from white
Russian is super underrated strain and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of his standards for a long time
and It was killer weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was some really nice Finos of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I wish I knew I wish just for my weed
nerdism or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew I you know, I wish I knew
what AK 47 was Yeah, like what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Think if we're getting these cherry
liqueur phenotypes is from hexa butyrate
[SPEAKER_02]: not a turp But do you think that I mean
because we know that during that time
[SPEAKER_02]: there was one real strong cherry kicker
That was being used in Amsterdam Which was
[SPEAKER_02]: the either the Holland's Hope which was a
version of the Viking or just using Viking
[SPEAKER_02]: and they were being used widely at that
time so I I've never Now that I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just like and how commonly it occurs
it almost seems like it would have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: yes Chimera and crybaby both telling us
that the cherry is is is from It's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: turp, you know, yeah You know,
it's it's the alls and all the various
[SPEAKER_00]: esters and all the various things that
lead to aromas That's not that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not matanize Forte necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of learning that I could do
Over there that would expand my knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love if he told me what was in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It would be really it would be really
neat just to know because it's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: all-time great strains Yeah, the super
cool strain and it's neat that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: It's neat that there is maybe here's
something that we've talked about and that
[SPEAKER_00]: most people don't don't think about too
much but We're getting close to the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll throw it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and maybe this is something that
like Chimera could chime in on or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: but What would happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you have two ak-47s or You know
or two nl5 hazes or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: from the 90s and you're pretty damn sure
that they are what they are That they're
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same Era, they're the exact same
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just two different two different
plants, but from the same seed line Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you reverse one onto the other Do you
get a feminized seed line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not an out cross and it's not
an s1 So so give me the situation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you took you know a Cherry AK
and crossed it to the Colorado Sandalwood
[SPEAKER_00]: AK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's not an s1 And it's not an out
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: No Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when we make up words like in cross
That's when we make them up because
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is very unique and we got a Make
up our own fucking words You could do it
[SPEAKER_00]: with anything you could take any any
anything that you know are sisters Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that came from the same parents Right
because most people that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: reversals Ninety nine point nine nine
percent of reversals are either s ones or
[SPEAKER_02]: out process Yeah, we would I mean I know
me and Caleb refer to them as f2r's just
[SPEAKER_02]: when we talk So we know what we're talking
about but I don't think there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: standard term Because there's a way where
it's like, you know part of the reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: we do s ones One of the reasons why we do
it in cannabis at least is because often
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only one Fino There's only one
living cut of a certain line left And in
[SPEAKER_00]: order for you to look within the genetics
of the line and see what else might be in
[SPEAKER_00]: there You have to cross it to itself Yeah,
we would make normal lines out of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these strains had we a male Yes,
or had we but if you have two females and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sure they're the exact same thing
Right, then you could breed new sisters
[SPEAKER_00]: together Yeah, and it wouldn't be in
breeding as much because they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: two different genetic profiles Yes,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not you're not in you're not in
breeding to the extent than an s1 would be
[SPEAKER_00]: no No, you're not you're not isolating
traits still so you take you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: sandalwood smelling Ak-47 and you cross it
onto the cherry ak-47 Yeah, and you you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and then you have you have a you
have a feminized seed line, maybe that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what Bitter did with the p91 s ones took
two different p91 s ones and cross them
[SPEAKER_02]: together to create his neck But the
difference is that those are two s ones
[SPEAKER_00]: cross together Yeah, I'm talking about
like two sisters from the same exact
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid You see I'm saying that's my was
though two sisters from the same if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have an s1 If you have two sisters from an
s1, there's one parent And that's yeah has
[SPEAKER_00]: one parent right there's two Identical
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genetics is essentially one parent
But if you take two sisters from a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: line Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, then it's two parents You know and
it's like if you like for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got multiple daughters you look at my
daughters They're not two piece from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, obviously, you know, they have some
of they got you know They look very
[SPEAKER_00]: different from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my wife and I's jeans popped in
different ways in that regard so you're
[SPEAKER_02]: referring specifically to An f1 hybrid and
then using two Sisters from that f1 hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: not from a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Like let's say for instance you took
You know, we can't get we can't guarantee
[SPEAKER_00]: this but let's say you took c5 Yeah,
and crossed it to Cuban black and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you know that you're you or you had
two phenos of nl5 haze Yeah, and you knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that the mom was nl5 and the dad was haze
in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just two phenos from the same thing
right and You've crossed those two you
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed one onto the other Yeah,
that's probably one of the most rare
[SPEAKER_00]: things in breeding Because then you'd have
a feminized line, but it wouldn't be an
[SPEAKER_00]: s1.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Mean the only difference between that in
the feminized version would be that the
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized word version would have less
variation Because there wasn't an
[SPEAKER_02]: additional Line at the what we're calling
the parental level, but that's In the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that so let's say you take let's say
you make a cherry aks1 Yeah, you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: only have the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's within that specific That specific
plant It would be going in that direction
[SPEAKER_02]: for that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but if you had if you had a sister
of hers Yes, there's so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they're sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: She probably has a different a slightly
different genetic makeup So it'd be a
[SPEAKER_00]: sibling cross Yeah, but it's almost never
done because we almost Never have to it
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be nearly as inbred Yeah,
it wouldn't be nearly as inbred as a
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse cross you probably you'd probably
get like a lot wider expression within the
[SPEAKER_02]: seats You know what's interesting though
what you're describing is almost exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what DJ did with blueberry two things that
were were from the same parentage to just
[SPEAKER_02]: totally opposite different expressions and
constantly recross them from a small
[SPEAKER_00]: population each generation I mean,
I'm not saying that like in a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: world if you had hundreds of seeds That's
the direction that you should go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I'm just saying that like is a
method There's there's an aspect where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like if all you have in the line is
one living living example Then you all you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do is self it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but if you got two Then you could
widen the gene pool just slightly Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have and have a group of seeds that
had a slightly wider gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you could get without Yeah,
but I think like if you keep it like he
[SPEAKER_02]: did it with moon bow 99 and moon bow 112
Yeah, I think if you do that and you keep
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it and successive generations What
you get is a lot of mutants and weirdness
[SPEAKER_02]: without necessarily the the narrowed down
variation I was just thinking in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: like 90s weed or Various things where you
might get lucky and you might have one or
[SPEAKER_00]: you might have two or even three phenos
that might exist Yeah You see them Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: like where it wouldn't be that that would
probably be I don't know, you know It's
[SPEAKER_00]: just something that's not often done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's two phenols from the same
line, you might be able to figure it out
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's almost never done Think of
somebody think of somebody that has It's
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's almost like back-crossing it's
not often don't see back You don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: back-crosses to males often done,
but it's an Interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its place Yeah, I just in terms of
and I mean in terms of most genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation We're like super lucky if one
phenol of an old line survives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah for sure You know, but in the
case of in the case of nl5 by Hayes C
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably three or four or five
that survived Yeah, a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we really knew for sure I think
there'd be a lot more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there's potential where you could
you could you know, you could I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just interesting in that in
that regard, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah project the monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are not siblings We don't know for
sure They're not fucking siblings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we want the parents of the other
we hoped that we hoped that that phylos
[SPEAKER_00]: and some other and some other genetic
groups would be able to prove these things
[SPEAKER_00]: and It has not happened Yeah, no phylos
got everybody's money because they
[SPEAKER_00]: promised they would be able to show what
was a grandparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was a child?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was a hut?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was a daughter?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was a mother and not not the case and
we're still gonna do a full episode on
[SPEAKER_02]: that eventually on why Why we were able to
prove that it was a broken system
[SPEAKER_02]: Effectively prove it but yeah You're gonna
give it a little bit of time so people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't get too butthurt and sue and all
that shit you know, but it's it's just one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things where Between no whether
males or females Are responsible specific
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no there's no, you know,
there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that Because because cannabis for a long
time has been Well, I just I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say that Cannabis for a long time
has been deprived of science or the
[SPEAKER_00]: science aspect of of breeding Most of it
is observational by people still to this
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people that There are some
People that are doing that are doing work
[SPEAKER_00]: that are using a lot more scientific
methods and things like that, but It's
[SPEAKER_00]: rare still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most cannabis breeding is
observational And so it's hard to know
[SPEAKER_00]: males and females You know, we just don't
have we just we just were denied up until
[SPEAKER_00]: ten fit ten years ago or something like
that We were mostly denied labs Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were mostly denied access to what you
know normal breeders would be Able to use
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time Yeah, so I want to do a
giveaway before we're done since we're
[SPEAKER_02]: almost at two hours and I actually thought
of something to do so you didn't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we used to do back in the back in
I don't know a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked out a Phrase there's gonna be a
blank spot in this phrase and whoever
[SPEAKER_02]: comes up with who we all agree Is the
funniest answer gets the bomb threat
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble Hawaiian lights hybrid?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the more expensive ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to get it out there so people
can Yeah, anyways, so we have a few
[SPEAKER_02]: different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see Okay, here we go here it is you
guys if you want to participate you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have to fill in the blank
Rub-a-dub-dub blank in a tub who has the
[SPEAKER_02]: best answer rub-a-dub-dub your answer in
the tub who has The best answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this one should be nice and
creative Rub-a-dub-dub blank in a tub
