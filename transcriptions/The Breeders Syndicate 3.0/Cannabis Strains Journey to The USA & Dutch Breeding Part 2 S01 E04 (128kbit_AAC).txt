[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Breeder Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with our other host, Natso.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even like calling you a co-host
because you're really just the other host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the other host indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we're going to cover cannabis
breeding as it was back in the Dutch era,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly in pre Dutch era and a little bit
after and why it matters today and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: apply that to what we're working with
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to take you through
like some early days of breeding kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: up to what we've already done so far,
which is like the the 80s Holland era and
[SPEAKER_00]: that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll move forward on to
different stuff later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought about like I don't know
exactly how much time we'll spend on each
[SPEAKER_00]: specific topic, but we thought about like
it might be interesting to we thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be interesting to talk about how we
got here as far as breeding techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to know where we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to know where we came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the the easiest way,
you know, we won't we could spend an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous amount of time on how cannabis
moved around places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the basic premise is that
for most of the like what we consider to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like the land race regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people were starting to get imports
into America, they were coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Jamaica,
Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those type of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were importing seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how did those farmers how did those
farmers get to the point where they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing tons of cannabis and exporting it
to our region?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, it's at some point in the
past, we don't need to spend a super
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, somewhere humans figured
out that THC had cool effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets fucked up, you know, by by a lot
by a lot of people, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: humans started interacting with plants and
the nature around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started figuring out which ones were
good to eat, which ones were good for
[SPEAKER_00]: health, which ones did this, which ones
did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on a certain level, there was a
point where people figured out that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, marijuana that, you know,
the wild marijuana strains had some
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, whether it was like hand rubbed
Shiraz, making hashish by rubbing buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: then getting it on their hands and then
rubbing it off and smoking it or consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: it or various aspects like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started to sort out that this was a
useful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like just every other kind of
useful plant from corn to watermelons to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else, people started messing with
it to get more of what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we what we think is, is we think as
as you go from wild populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, that that started that humans
started interacting with to planted
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of cannabis by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we assume is the traditional method
is that people would go out into these
[SPEAKER_00]: fields and they would pick females that
they like the smell, they like the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, they liked whatever it was
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they like that it had increased THC
compared to its nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would keep those plants and then
therefore next year they would plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of seeds from their favorite
females.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then over time, year after year,
generation after generation, humans
[SPEAKER_00]: started slowly improving their local gene
pool and breeding it towards things they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was terps back then, although
they obviously wouldn't have called it
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aromas, effects, weight, you know,
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Different farmers, I'm sure, had vastly
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, farmers back then seed
collecting was part of the way they grew
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you picked your favorite plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were seeded and you grew that next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, humans started having
a massive impact on what kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what kind of plants were being
grown because they'd done this selection
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, over time, over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pretty much, I think,
happened virtually everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere the cannabis was in the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of not well known,
but just really quickly, they think that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sort of started in the highland
areas around China, Tibetan Plateau,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that kind of region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went down into India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went down into Pakistan and
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about twenty seven hundred years ago,
we have verifiable evidence that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Scythians, who were like central Steppe
people, were using it in their culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was being used in the very
northern parts of Afghanistan and in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain parts of the Caucasus Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also they found THC burned in
temples about 60 miles south of Jerusalem
[SPEAKER_00]: about twenty seven hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so there's a situation where
obviously like we have we don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: long ago it started, but China and Tibet
and the Caucasus Mountains and where
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel is right now are obviously pretty
far, far apart from each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially from the way that people got
around at the time, which was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, camels, horses, donkeys,
et cetera.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so smoking and consuming either hash or
cannabis is at least three thousand years
[SPEAKER_00]: old, documented in multiple spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably goes back significantly
farther than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just haven't found absolute evidence
that it occurred.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, then you have it,
then you have a scenario in which so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of how it starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts up in Tibet and China area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes down into Pakistan, India,
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts going into Iran and the Middle
East.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes down into into Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Russia, it turns into what becomes
known as Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so so then so then there's a
you know, the the weird part is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Americas, right, is how it got to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like although this isn't one
hundred percent verified, but it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like that most of the stuff that ended up
in America came along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: conquistadors and then later the slave
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a bunch of hemp hemp was
obviously used for most rope, most sales
[SPEAKER_00]: was sailors brought it with them
everywhere because it was like if you got
[SPEAKER_00]: shipwrecked or something, you might need
to grow a crop of hemp to turn it into
[SPEAKER_00]: sales or rope again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could get off your island or
wherever you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, hemp was hemp was critical
to that era's trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of brought everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like to Brazil, to the
Caribbean, to Mexico, when they when they
[SPEAKER_00]: start talking about that kind of thing,
genetically, most cannabis from those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions ties back to some kind of African.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's there's not a lot of evidence
to back this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the strange thing is, is when they did
genetic work on Panamanian and Colombian,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has to tie back to to Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I only have like one little tidbit
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has nothing to do with cannabis
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, at some point, if that if
it's true in the genetics of Panama and
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia tie back to more Southeast Asia
region, then somehow it had to get from
[SPEAKER_00]: there to from Southeast Asia to the
western half of South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's essentially two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either it happened once the Spanish and
others started trading with the East after
[SPEAKER_00]: the conquests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there's another interesting thing where
there's Pacific Islanders and some others
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've done genetic testing on in
Southeast Asia and some of these islands
[SPEAKER_00]: where they have discovered pre-Columbian
Indian people's DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these Pacific Islanders, from about
eleven or twelve hundred A.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know for a fact, because they
interbred, they had babies with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They implanted some of their DNA from
pre-Columbian peoples into Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Islanders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know for a fact that hundreds of
years, three, four hundred years,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps, before Columbus sailed and
discovered and rediscovered the Caribbean
[SPEAKER_00]: and Americas, there was some kind of trade
or at least interrelationships between the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Islanders and the Panamanian and
Colombian peoples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know if people are fucking,
they're probably smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and since we know that that was
absolutely was absolutely required for
[SPEAKER_00]: sailing, it makes sense that it
theoretically could have been required for
[SPEAKER_00]: sailing back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they traded some of these
pre-Columbian indigenous peoples that were
[SPEAKER_00]: sailing out to the Pacific Islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They traded them some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds would be necessary on both
ports if they're going both places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have guaranteed proof that they were
interbreeding at eleven hundred A.D.
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the way DNA and genetics works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that there was trade ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly when, but it does
seem like Colombian and Panamanian tie in
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow to the Southeast Asia portion of
the gene pool, not the African,
[SPEAKER_00]: where Mexican, Jamaican, the island weed,
the stuff that's on the eastern side of
[SPEAKER_00]: South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all seems to come from African
origins, which makes sense because there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't just a mammoth amount of trade both
slave and otherwise coming over from all
[SPEAKER_00]: portions of Africa over to the New World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we know some of it was introduced
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's entirely possible that that some of
it was introduced earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, some of this some of
this stuff is not poorly, poorly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, documents poorly documented for
lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the conquistadors burned most of
the writings of the Mayans and the Aztecs
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other peoples because they thought
they were devil work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of their knowledge was sort of
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they even had written down and we
just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you fast forward again and you have
these various people in these various
[SPEAKER_00]: regions that are improving their own
genetic stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in Thailand, the people in
Laos, the people in Mexico, the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, they're growing their stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are working with what them and other
local farmers in their area have access
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're breeding it every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all of these varietals
kind of came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it was all seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was, you know,
and there was two distinct cultures going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should mention this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the North Indian, Pakistan and
Afghanistan regions, it was primarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they viewed the plant as essentially I
don't want to say that either is garbage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they viewed it as a way to get a hold
of the trichomes, whether they did hand
[SPEAKER_00]: rub, like I was talking about,
or whether they did dry sift or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: method they used to extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought that the proper use of
cannabis was to turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but then you go to Laos or Cambodia
or Thailand or Mexico or Colombia,
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoked flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had some groups breeding for
specific basic basically hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had some groups breeding for
smokable flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were the kind of those were the
kind of selections that people were making
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, obviously,
like America is founded on capitalistic
[SPEAKER_00]: principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's a demand somewhere and
there's a supply somewhere else,
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Smith says that the invisible hand
should come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get the supply from where it is to
where the demand is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all these regions that we've
talked about have been probably improving
[SPEAKER_00]: their crops a year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saving their best seed like they
do with their food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slowly improving their genetic
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really not a lot of
interaction between them and other groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of growing what's available
in their area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except except for the one thing we had
talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's referenced in Rob Clark's
hashish book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except in Afghanistan, where they were
importing, they had learned the trade of
[SPEAKER_01]: of hand rubbing and hash collecting via
the route from India.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the stuff during that time,
they were importing Indian more sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: type narrow leaf varieties to Afghanistan
because that's what the Indians were using
[SPEAKER_01]: to make their hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't using their Afghanis in
their fields yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't using those to get the
trichomes, collect and make the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were actually using Indian sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until more modern the past
1950 when they started using and
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting their own varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a better way to more accurate way
to state it would just say that like we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't discount that there was some
regional trading going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between say India, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
they're all connected to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be Panamanian and Colombian
going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some Caribbean exchanges,
but in general, there wasn't Caribbean
[SPEAKER_00]: trading with Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't like different regions of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regions themselves mixed a bit,
you know, it's obviously not written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to determine with any
kind of factual basis how it exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have all these over all hundreds
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that like America gets
involved, you have all these weed
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have developed around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are hash cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are smokable flower cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, they made different
decisions on their strains based on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whether they wanted to smoke
flour or whether they wanted to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, prohibition was was fully
going on in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, invisible hand comes in and
there's a bunch of people in America that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musicians, jazz artists, hippies,
counterculture, beat necks, various,
[SPEAKER_00]: various types of people get introduced to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely Mota, probably most people's
first experiences with it were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican coming into the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of, you know, back and
flow over the border with Mexican,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, farm working and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably brought it with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely records of of jazz,
famous jazz people smoking it in the 20s
[SPEAKER_00]: and 30s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking that jazz cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I mean, obviously it was
it was a big enough issue that they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to do some crazy prohibition in
the late 1930s up till that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so then you have a situation where
you start hitting like what matters to
[SPEAKER_00]: most people, I think, with with this way
that we've kind of brought ourselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: here is that various entrepreneurs decided
to start sourcing weed from various
[SPEAKER_00]: countries that grew weed and figure out a
way to get it into America and sell it for
[SPEAKER_00]: a high dollar to American people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference in profit between
buying it from a Thai farmer to selling it
[SPEAKER_00]: to a guy that lives in Venice Beach was
extremely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of economic incentive
for these people to start figuring out
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to smuggle it into the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and feed the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sadly, one thing that was so we
start getting imports, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We start getting we start getting imports
and we start getting things from Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start smuggling from Panama and
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: People certainly start smuggling from
Jamaica and other Caribbean islands,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, Hawaii, you know, Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pretty famous smugglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were working in Thailand and Cambodia
and Laos in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start, you know, all the famous
stuff you've heard about, Colombian gold,
[SPEAKER_00]: Panama red tie sticks, every every I'm
sure Matt can think of some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Jamaican lamb's bread,
you know, Polly from the Mexican,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Mexican stuff was generally
named by region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Mijua Khan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you had various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like those were the
first names that you would get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the very first names of weed was
like where it's from and maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: nickname, like maybe maybe and like maybe
they tried Colombian gold into a brownish
[SPEAKER_00]: gold color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was Panamanian red and it
had red hair or there was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they wrapped they wrapped
in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrapped the loose buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around sticks to make it like a more these
go from like a super leafy hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_00]: loose flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pack them tight to make it into
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get tie stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the original names,
they're not really strange names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, this is where it's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is its nickname that we gave to
it from where it's from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly a color or smell or some other
attribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or a rhyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui waui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked it because it rhymed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that's the reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and so that's when so
that's when like the breeding that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody is familiar with kind of starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all this seeded weed coming
into America from all these regions I
[SPEAKER_00]: named Southeast Asia, the Caribbean,
Mexico, America, you know, South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, I mean, for the younger
cats out there, you know, I used to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there with my head down and a tray at an
angle and you would break your weed up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that allowed all the seeds to
roll down the tray and collect at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom lip of the tray as you broke up all
your herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd have a bunch of fluffed up
herb for a bowl or a bong or rolling a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody got free seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't really too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we weren't really too much of a hash
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also hash is is trichomes
separated from the flower and the such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that was coming into America
at first was various kinds of sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the sativas were the buds,
you know, and if you were getting imported
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani indica hash, you were getting
blocks of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't getting Afghani bud like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come with free seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no free seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there was sometimes the random seed
didn't break a hash stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The random bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a famous actually there's
some serious debate in Europe over over.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two camps basically on the on the
White Widow camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, just so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason why I bring that up is
because there's a guy over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingmar, and one of the one of the stories
about how White Widow happened is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: founding part of White Widow is he was
breaking up a block of imported hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds fell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got an original Afghan from some
region out of that block of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was some hash being
imported into America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, you know, it it didn't
come with free seats where there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: seedless in any of these other regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the sativas that we were importing
came with free seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that free seed is the start of every
famous breeder you ever heard of's
[SPEAKER_00]: journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people start smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start liking the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what would happen if I started
growing my own weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emerald Triangle, Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humble County, Mendocino County,
where I live, the Central Coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco, Santa Cruz area of
Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legendarily, you know, basically anywhere
where it was mountainous, people weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the climate was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying people weren't doing it in
other parts of the country, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, wherever people could start
to get away with it with their with their
[SPEAKER_00]: imports, they start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mecca's were built and Mecca's were
built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the only reason why I brought up
those regions is because enough people in
[SPEAKER_00]: those regions all decided to start doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started the beginnings of American
growing culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in upstate New York or
Oklahoma or Florida or some shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably trying to keep it pretty
small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was definitely some stuff
with hippies in Santa Cruz and Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Central Coast and different areas that
they were a little bit more open with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a little bit more trading
going on and a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: culture started to develop where some of
the other more harsh police state regions
[SPEAKER_00]: of the United States that were a lot more
populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot more secretive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, circles were even smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people start growing seed,
probably with varying success,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they start discovering stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start discovering that when you grow
Thai and you grow Colombian, boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it hard to finish in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the stuff wants to go till
December, January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our weather doesn't go that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start having issues with getting,
you know, because if you could grow weed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the seed, then you could get free
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't have to be buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this free weed look like when it
hasn't been compressed and bailed and
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped from, you know, international
locations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what would it be like if you got it
fresh?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initial success for people was,
you know, people people could get the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexicans to finish because the Mexicans
typically were farther away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: equator and they were a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had significant struggles getting
the Colombian and the Panama and the and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ties and the different stuff like that
to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this this this is where people start to
get the idea of like, I got some tie stick
[SPEAKER_00]: or I got some Colombian gold and I got
some Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens if I grow them up and I
cross them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's basically the start of
American breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the that's the the honest to God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the start of how everybody in
America started breeding things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to say America is
unique, but it is rare in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: America is the plate or one of the places
where for the first time in hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: years, people started crossing these
wildly different gene pools from these
[SPEAKER_00]: different regions together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think the way you put it the
other night and I wrote it down because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was it was worded very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever and wherever the weed was becoming
imported the most, that's where the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: was blended together the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's well put.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and so there's so so,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you know, there's you know,
there's some pretty famous stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: started happening that people started
getting these different these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started breeding them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started experimenting with stuff in
the San Francisco Bay Area and in Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz and stuff like what became known as
Hayes started, which according to Sam and
[SPEAKER_00]: others was essentially Colombian by
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and but you needed a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed they figured with some of these
some of these land races, you needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it in a mild climate, which the
Central Coast and the Bay Area definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you needed you needed some way to
protect it from the weather and give it
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some heat or some whatever and
finish it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start crossing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the famous people that started
crossing things is a guy named Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob has some very famous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started crossing Colombians and
Mexicans because Mexicans finish quite
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was trying to get the qualities
of the two and get something that would
[SPEAKER_00]: finish in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they start breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, Sam Skunkman is breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's other various people
that are popping and doing all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the the oldest and most legendary
names that we know are from this era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from this like pioneer take some
Thai, take some Cambodian, cross them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, cross it with some Colombian,
cross it with some Mexican, cross it with
[SPEAKER_00]: some this, cross some Jamaican by this,
you know, trade some seeds with your
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so that's kind of like the
start of like cannabis growing in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On any kind of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even when I started in the early
90s, I still have them somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got like three books that I bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge was extremely limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no forums to confuse you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and so even for me in the 90s,
think about how difficult it must have
[SPEAKER_00]: been for the people in the 70s that had
even less knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the things I'll hold it up
right now, one of the things that taught
[SPEAKER_00]: me breeding was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took his experience with growing a bunch
of weed and breeding a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he figured out how marijuana grows,
how it breeds, how it triggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the different traits, the different
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote sort of a Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote a basic Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started out, I was able to buy
this Bible when I got interested in weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was able to read this book over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it taught me a ton about how to grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Matt had the same experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most readers, most readers that get
curious about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've read Rob Clark's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hear a seed maker and you actually
are passionate and want to learn and make
[SPEAKER_01]: things better, you almost everyone
eventually runs into Rob Clark's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, I think with the Breeders
Syndicate thing, one of the plans is to do
[SPEAKER_01]: for Patreon a course based on cannabis
evolution and ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob Clark gave us his permission to use
that for a course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that would be pretty cool to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, I mean, I don't need to go
through all of it, but he started talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the differences and latitude and,
you know, finish times and the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: in the various kinds of cannabis and
regions and what to expect from them,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make seed, how to make seed mature,
like really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, he deserves an enormous
amount of credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm sure there was an enormous
amount of fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what breeding, when breeding is 90%
of fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a, there was a, there was a,
you know, they had to learn all that and
[SPEAKER_00]: they had to, they had to put that down
into some kind of information base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure his journey to learn was
significantly harder than the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: came after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was no books for him to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think there was any
cannabis books in the sixties and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the seventies, it sort of
exploded a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Murphy, who we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Murphy Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Murphy Stevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his pen name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the gentleman that gave the
Afghani seeds to Seattle Greg,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he used to create what we know as
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote some, I think, like by 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 73, 74 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some books out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal started
contributing some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Sinsimela Tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was various other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people started, seventies is where all
of a sudden there starts to be like
[SPEAKER_00]: information coming out that people can
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have to like learn from
scratch or what their neighbor knows or
[SPEAKER_00]: what their buddy that got them into it
knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so and so, you know, Rob,
Rob did things like Rob crossed Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robin and Sam Skunkman are friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Skunk One is Afghan by Colombian
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they start blending things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer things with shorter things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start looking to see, can I get the
traits of this Mexican with the traits of
[SPEAKER_00]: this Colombian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get this tie to stop herming and not
take seven months?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bud structure to the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud structure, all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and then so people so
people start crossing these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe this is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's really happening in the I
don't know exactly when it started
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the 60s, but it definitely
was happening in the 60s to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It accelerated greatly in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to chime in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg actually said, I studied Luther
Burbank and then bought all of Rob's
[SPEAKER_01]: books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burbank worked with cannabis in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even even somebody like Greg, who's I
consider to be a very early pioneer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob's work helped him, you know,
and so that's kind of and that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: also a theme that I'd like to say,
you know, right now is that and this
[SPEAKER_00]: remains true no matter what episode we're
going to chat about is that every single
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder out there stands on the shoulders
of the people that came before them,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's whether it's the seeds and
the genetics they have access to,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's the forums or books or
knowledge from older cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a wave of pioneers that really
figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every generation after that,
every group after that, they got to take
[SPEAKER_00]: their work in genetics and improve it or
mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as the case may be, depending on
your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also got a bunch of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time a lot of you guys on this with
that are listening, got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was probably forums you could go
there with breeding forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you go on the breeding forum of
Overgrow and there's Sam Skunkman and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kamara and people that have a lot of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're reading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the Internet books started
putting the knowledge out there in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to really access, which really
sped up the time it took.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, on a I mean,
on a previous interview that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg's on this when when Matt interviewed
Greg, I mean, Greg spoke about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they got some Afghan beans that
were extremely limited from Steve Murphy
[SPEAKER_00]: and they crossed them to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they basically crossed them with
every sativa they knew of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiians, Colombians, ties, you know,
lots of Mexicans, lots of Mexicans,
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of this, lots of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just everybody was just playing
around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the other part that people need
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that nobody knew what an Afghan by
Mexican would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hadn't happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew what Colombian by Mexican would
look like because that hadn't happened
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these pioneers, they're
taking, you know, Rob's like, I wonder if
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Colombian and Mexican and crossed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then maybe later on when
skunk one is born, Sam is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I got access to some Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's cross this Afghan into your skunk
into your, you know, your Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that'll shorten it up even earlier
and it'll be done in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this and I think this is a good segue
into talking about how breeding for just
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what happens turned in to breeding
for traits as they learn these traits as
[SPEAKER_01]: they as they saw, you know, this one's
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one smells like watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one smells like cereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we combine these traits,
you know, let's let's see if we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: this trait to pop out if we cross this and
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started going and actually having
a purpose for breeding with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: finding out that there were these traits
that they could follow long flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: short flowering colors, smell,
taste high, all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went from seeing what can happen to
a real purpose, a real purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think probably the two traits in
the beginning that people were after was I
[SPEAKER_00]: like the way this weed tastes and smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't finish where I live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get it to finish where I live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of this stuff like
Panamanian, Colombian, the Southeast Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is all very near the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: America is not particularly near the
equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so they had to figure out how do
I blend stuff to get the stuff I like and
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to grow it in my region.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there's a big financial
incentive in that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't have to import it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to come through customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where Green Bud was
born.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way that most of these
traditional cultures, they didn't have air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioned dry rooms or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them dried hanging in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them dried in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them dried it and then key load
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it begins to ferment and it gets
wrapped up in plastic for weeks or months
[SPEAKER_00]: and then shipped for some period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you were lucky, maybe you got
some green Mexican that was only lightly
[SPEAKER_00]: compressed that they figured out some way
to get it across the border without
[SPEAKER_00]: smushing it into a block that you could
cut with a knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually like break it up into
actual buds instead of it just being like
[SPEAKER_00]: a flat mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so that's where,
you know, Greg Steve Murphy was breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg and his whole Pacific Northwest crew,
the you know, most people in California
[SPEAKER_00]: were breeding either outdoor or in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indoor wave was still and maybe this
is a good segue for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I printed out this thing and you can't
really see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to read it because it's
extremely dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a this is a seed catalog,
you know, from 1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tied into Sam and his crew,
we assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it lists strains in order of when they
matured, October, November and December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lists like what so it gives you a
snapshot of what people were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll read it to you in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Afghani one Afghani two Afghani
two purple skunk one skunk two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five things before that finish before
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The faster finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Polly Malawi, Nepali, Afghani,
Malawi, Nepali, early haze by Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are done hopefully by
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here comes the mother load of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say on this list, it says all of
the above can be grown outside in most
[SPEAKER_00]: years in the SF Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the October and the November
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then below it, it says all below
require a greenhouse to finish in the San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got South Indian one,
two, three original haze one to four
[SPEAKER_00]: burning bush, Nepali haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes, Nepali, Nepali haze, South Indian,
early haze, South Indian, haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: South Indian, Thai haze, South Indian,
South African haze, burning bush by Nepali
[SPEAKER_00]: burning bush by South haze by South Indian
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you even have one category
matures in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra late New Year's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe when people are listening to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're you're realizing that,
oh, my God, everything that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning other than Afghani and skunk
I've never had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't have I don't I don't I don't
Malawi and Nepali and haze Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepali and this and that and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of there's a bunch of
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you like a snapshot of like
these are what the breeders back then were
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is super different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know, maybe we can mention
this, even though it kind of like it fits
[SPEAKER_00]: in, but it kind of doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why we're talking about all
this stuff is that basically like every 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years, in my opinion, cannabis reinvents
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was common becomes uncommon or
rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go 20 years from that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what becomes uncommon or rare becomes
like impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Matt and I were recently looking
at somebody's freezer collection that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had been gifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really exciting to look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of it was from 08 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was selecting heavily during that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was Matt's kind of era when he
was really collecting a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's amazing that it's it's only
10 to 13, 14 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 98 percent of that stuff that's on the
list you couldn't buy today if you wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd be lucky to find a reproduction
if you were lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be lucky to find a reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's some famous people
on there like, you know, a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that people found fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rascal work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of awesome shit back then,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nowadays, like I even still look out
for like White Urkel and White Master and
[SPEAKER_01]: a few things when I see him in lists,
but they're they're not common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was selling tons of those packs
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still probably is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this stuff that we're talking
about, right, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's common in this in the 60s and 70s
becomes uncommon, common in the 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost unheard of in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: A unicorn by by today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just keeps happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every every 10 or 15 years, what you used
to be able to get easy access to becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: super hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then every generation, those 10 or 15
years, they're building on certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: like I mentioned that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a series of Afghanis that made it
over to Neville and SSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this there's hazes, there's scums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different things that happened in
that in that era that survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the stuff on that list,
you've never smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've never smoked burning bush
by Nepali myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what burning bush is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it was maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard I've heard it was a pre pre to
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was an early period,
you know, but but, you know, these names,
[SPEAKER_00]: South Indians, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they they just didn't they just
that but that's what they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these guys, what that shows you is
that all these guys, all these guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: basically breeding sativas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the majority of that list was some
sativas, a couple Afghanis, even skunk one
[SPEAKER_00]: was 75 percent sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a blend of Mexican,
Colombian and a little bit of Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was still even heavily influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Sam Skunkman became very famous in
that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where, you know, he he says he
started breeding his skunk one in nineteen
[SPEAKER_00]: seventy five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he bred it for eight or ten
years before he brought it to California
[SPEAKER_00]: or brought it from California to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank was working with an Afghan that
got named Afghani one that he got from
[SPEAKER_00]: another Bay Area breeder who had gotten
some Afghani seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got some Durban poison that he was
working in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were breeding some other stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Clark was obviously busy in Seattle,
Greg's neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had somehow come across some Afghan
and they were also blending in some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the various sativas that
people had then in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people call stuff Hawaiian,
but there obviously is no Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety eight percent of the species on
Hawaii are not native because it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: island in the middle of nowhere that
created by a volcano.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people started bringing Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started bringing Thai and Colombian
and Afghans and Mexicans there and
[SPEAKER_00]: blending them and growing them on the
islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they became known as Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even though there are there's no
Hawaiian genetics, there's a blending of
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas maybe with a touch Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick plug for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if you're enjoying it,
we have our Patreon shop up or we have our
[SPEAKER_01]: merchandise shop up and we have our
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the week, we discuss a lot of
this stuff in Discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go on a lot of topics, answer questions
there and we have a pretty fucking awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: community for it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to our Patreon Breeder Syndicate if
you want to participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, merch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got hats, hoodies, shirts, you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been, you know, kind of like took
a while, but yeah, it kind of walked
[SPEAKER_00]: people through sort of like and now we're
starting to enter this point where we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk we'll talk a little bit more about
how the shift happened and then we'll and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because we got some good questions
this week, so we might as well chat at
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast forward a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are doing all this stuff in the 70s
and, you know, in the in the late 70s,
[SPEAKER_00]: things were really blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were doing all kinds of stuff
together in various in these various
[SPEAKER_00]: regions I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really advancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Carter loses the election.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reagan gets Reagan gets involved and the
war on drugs gets ramped up and the world
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to fuck from the from where it had
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: The penalties are they start putting more
money into it and they start flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start taking helicopters and they
start flying in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start flying in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start flying in the Central Valley
and some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that does is that all of a
sudden, all these guys are growing all
[SPEAKER_00]: this weed and they're growing it in the
mountain regions and they're growing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: valleys and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not too concerned because
nobody's looking for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, there's a
helicopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flying overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got a big field that nobody's
ever bothered with before and they get in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So pressure starts happening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they start hunting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is when so we mentioned
before Steve Murphy's book and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people were on what's called the
hippie hashish trail where people were
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling to Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were traveling to India.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were traveling to the Hindu Kush
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were meeting up with tribal people
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was some small amount of
Afghan seeds and Indicas that started
[SPEAKER_00]: making its way into America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mostly only to breeder circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not to consumers the way every
bag of every sack of weed you bought had a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of seeds in it for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they started trickling in smuggling
style to Trinity Humboldt, Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Bay Area, to various other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in Steve Murphy's book,
you see some broadleaf Afghans in 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you know, Seattle Greg was
working with some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the big advantage in the beginning
to people was that you start crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: these Afghans into some of these sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now maybe you're getting stuff that's
finishing the more heavy Afghan you
[SPEAKER_00]: select.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're finishing in September or October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one second, I just want to make sure
everybody's really paying close attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to this part, because I found one of the
biggest myths in cannabis is that Afghanis
[SPEAKER_01]: existed in our culture, you know,
just as long as sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as we've been smoking broad or
narrowly, you know, people didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: that Afghanis came as a late entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see a lot of these people
making claims about 60s Afghanis and 50s
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanis, it's very easy to discount with
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while seed of sativas, like we said
before, were getting imported by the
[SPEAKER_00]: literal ton with every bag of weed you
bought, you got seeds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the the Indica stuff was being brought
back by smugglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would imagine would be
relatively small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in his interview, you know,
Greg told you that he got a whopping four
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whopping a whopping four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the biggest problem that,
you know, you grow in Afghanistan and you
[SPEAKER_00]: and you grow in the Hindu Kush mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously colder there and it's
extremely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people start growing them in America
and they rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the sativas were grown in tropical,
much more humid regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of genetic resistance to
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the things that people
were trying to figure out is they can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: these Afghans and they're like,
oh, my God, it's amazing, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty, crazy looking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get some weather and all of a
sudden it rots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a totally different high than a
lot of people used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People go from an up, energetic,
kind of zippy high, somewhat psychedelic,
[SPEAKER_00]: laugh this that Indica's come with much
more couch lock, much more heaviness,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the early smokers didn't like
Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it clashed so hard with what they
were used to as buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect, they weren't super into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a grower's perspective,
since I read all that stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going from November, December harvest to
September, October harvest, when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: police pressure becomes extremely
important.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, maybe we should talk
very briefly because it's a pretty simple
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I moved to Mendo in the late 90s,
people still mostly grew from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the traditional way that you grew from
seed was that you would grow some seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would pick your males.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would take your males to like a kind
of a darker part of your hill somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: and you would stash them away from your
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would grow your females in some
patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd collect pollen and you'd go
take this pollen from all your males and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd brush it on some of the lower
branches of your favorite females from
[SPEAKER_00]: that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that's how the vast majority
of breeding occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when you look at like Rob Clark's
book, he talks about like putting like a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper bag, the paper bag with a tie over
specific branches and putting pollen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: He even talks about like gluing a strip of
clear plastic so that it gets some sun on
[SPEAKER_00]: it while it's doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most 70s breeding in America was
pollinating the bottoms of stuff you were
[SPEAKER_00]: intending on selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keeping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, with the police
pressure and stuff like that, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really where modern modern breeding
starts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 70s breeding, not exclusively,
but essentially was the vast majority was
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonally they would pollinate their best
females with males they had kept somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the advent of indoor lights and the
advent of hydroponic stores and people
[SPEAKER_00]: like growing in the Pacific Northwest,
like we've talked about multiple times,
[SPEAKER_00]: people started to do some of this breeding
inside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started doing it away from the
helicopters, away from away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, away from the ability to get
caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also it also enabled people to do
more than one breeding a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back in the day, it's like back in
the day, you got like you got one shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden you go indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, as you know, you can get four or
five shots if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when that's when,
you know, prohibition really forced people
[SPEAKER_00]: to start going inside and going inside is
obviously how 99 percent of modern
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, you know, there's not I mean,
there are some people that still breed
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say most people breed outdoor
in modern times because it's much more
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap to make seeds that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the ones that take it very
seriously and are doing actual selections
[SPEAKER_01]: do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, most do it
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe I should rephrase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the seeds that you guys have
access to that you can buy currently were
[SPEAKER_00]: probably made indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, you don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all done outdoor in greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety nine percent of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety nine percent of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the seeds that people buy are
going to be coming from places to big seed
[SPEAKER_01]: banks from the UK, maybe stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I was looking at it is most of
this most of the small and most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the breeders that people are
actually buying a bunch of packs of these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're you know, they're mostly doing
they were mostly doing it in indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were doing it in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, he's correct in the sense that,
like, if I'm only talking about what most
[SPEAKER_00]: people have access to, obviously,
when it comes to like all the Mexican and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the traditional stuff and some of the
stuff that's going on in Europe at a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger scale where legality is different,
like Switzerland or Spain, they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: probably using greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like 95 percent of the market,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: For America, I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not American.
[SPEAKER_01]: American boutique breeding is still a
small market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then, a lot of these guys are
doing it outdoors, making the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors and crazy, crazy places that you
can never imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can never imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So small, small greenhouses tucked away or
make the most amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's I think for during the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early to late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to 2008, 2009, a lot of the boutique
breeders were all doing it indoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess that was a poorly phrased way
to say that from the 80s, 90s and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first 10 years, the 2000s for about a 30
year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition had a lot of breeding
happening indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your famous strains that you know
of, whether they were from SSC or from
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville or from smaller breeders in
America, all the northern lights work,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prohibition was heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legality was still not spread out very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for three decades, the vast
majority of of breeding that we're aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of did did happen inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's opened up again, you know,
in various ways in the last 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's began to shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took legalities changing in the US,
though, really, I think that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: changed it when people were able to grow
outdoor and not get popped for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They realized that the amount of seeds you
can make outdoor versus indoors is
[SPEAKER_01]: monumental.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your pollen pollen control is totally
a different subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen control is hard and pollen
viability is hard, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know people that have tried to
throw off huge greenhouse runs and their
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse is too moist and pollen doesn't
like heat, light or water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a bunch of people have a
bunch of failure because they weren't able
[SPEAKER_00]: to control their humidity in their
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think, oh, I'm going to make 15
million seeds and they make 80,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is still a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a far cry from 15 million because
they lost control of their humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, part of the so this is kind
of taking us up to like people are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad things are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these American breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what segues into what we've
done the last few shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of these American breeders start
fleeing where it's hot and uncomfortable,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Reagan.
[SPEAKER_00]: America to where it's more comfortable,
which is Europe, Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob ends up in going into Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam, Jim, all these guys are bringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Neville and all these groups
got access to it was not because that all
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys wanted to share was because
they were seeking a new place to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: doing what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it got real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got real problematic in the early in
the early to mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, to bring up Seattle,
Greg, again, he you know, he mentioned on
[SPEAKER_00]: you on when you interviewed him that by
the late 80s, a rolling series of busts
[SPEAKER_00]: had pretty much taken out his whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the work that they had done had been
lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, luckily, he shared it with
people in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Sam Skunkman and Rob and Mel and
Ed and these different names that shared
[SPEAKER_00]: things with groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did so because it was getting
uncomfortably hot to do it where they
[SPEAKER_00]: lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to they were trying
to figure out where to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that kind of segues us into what we
what we talked about, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were at of this is how breeding
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with SSC and with Neville and
with other groups and that whole era,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only because Holland has, you know,
not the greatest weather, but also for
[SPEAKER_00]: clandestine reasons and simplicity and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, most of the breeding in the 80s
and 90s, at least by the mid 80s through
[SPEAKER_00]: the 90s, was indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the famous strains, you know,
sour diesel was made inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the famous pops that happened
that came about 90s weed was coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was where people could get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were able to grow in the 60s and
70s for a while freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cops found out what they were
doing and they started looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became much more difficult to get
away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so then people responded to that
police pressure by hiding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went from sort of like yearly
breeding outside and in greenhouses to
[SPEAKER_00]: much more cracks at the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could breed, you could set up
different rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably very unlikely that somebody
like Neville or somebody like the super
[SPEAKER_00]: city of a seed club group would have been
able to offer as many strains as they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without individual rooms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The you know, Matt and I were joking about
the amount of pollen contamination that
[SPEAKER_00]: could have been possible back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but certainly if you're trying
to do it outside in greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're limited to one, you know,
one set of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's just going to be you're
just going to have pollen grains flying
[SPEAKER_00]: around and who knows what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing who's your daddy with seeds like a
lot of these guys do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so indoor gardening also allowed
people to you know, it allowed people to
[SPEAKER_00]: do multiple different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could offer skunk one and Durbin and
an L5 haze and an L5 skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could have, you know, I don't
exactly know the size of these people's
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms, but it's probably not that much
different than it was today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bedrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closets, some garages, you know,
some converted spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like that kind of like
brings us from like where we were in
[SPEAKER_00]: importing, you know, indigenous people's
weed to like how people first bred in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s to how it changed and police pressure
kind of led us to like where we're at
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of that's that's
kind of the arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of leads us right into what
we talked about at length the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes of how Neville was doing all his
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were, you know, they moved it
inside, you know, so I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we can pause since we're how long in
now, an hour and 10 minutes, hour and 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can pause and we can start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can see questions this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we should maybe we should start
an order on the votes aspect.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are each of your guys daily driver
strains right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you like about the strains to
use them every day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your what's your normal daily
driver like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily today, but your normal one
that you you would grab if you had it
[SPEAKER_01]: every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like, you know, I think it's pretty
obvious to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sour diesels and chems and
headbands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like strains that have a
potent and unique high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like strains that I can smoke
every day and they get me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of strains out there
that get you pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first number of days you smoke them
and then you kind of plateau on them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't take you to where you need to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like strains that have lasting power
and the ability to get me high the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: like every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no I mean, the Chem 91 makes
me feel like I'm a stone teenager about to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch a comedy eating popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a warm, fuzzy, comforting buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, an L5 hazes can make me feel up,
energetic, maybe a little paranoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, different types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, there's certain things that
are quite famous that I find have a boring
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so chems, headbands,
sour diesels, you know, sativas,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it depends on my mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I don't want to smoke,
you know, a high end sativa like dog shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 1130 at night right before bed,
because I might like set my mind off till
[SPEAKER_00]: 1am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, chems, headbands, diesels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like, Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty obvious with mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm a blueberry thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like different ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to Afghanis where most Afghanis,
generally speaking, broadly, if Afghanis
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to relax people and, and,
you know, ease them in, that fucks me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit makes me stay in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like living in your fucking head and
hate life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tend to like the ties that are really
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like lighter highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have to punch on when I can still,
I don't like to be disabled, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one point that we should make is that,
you know, we have some really good friends
[SPEAKER_00]: where some of my favorite strains,
they dislike, they don't dislike them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They breed with them, but they don't think
they're high very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is, you know, everybody
thinks what happens to me is normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with weed, it's not normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can have different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people, you know, there might be
people that have a little ADD that they
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a racy sativa and they feel calm and
relaxed and melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they smoke an Afghan and it makes
them want to jump out of their skin and
[SPEAKER_00]: climb up a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where an Afghan for me makes me want to
like lean back and eat some popcorn and
[SPEAKER_00]: mellow out and laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: An Afghan makes me want it like would make
me like think about chopping down my grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like paranoia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's kind of, it is very
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it doesn't affect people the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is what in your opinion
was the most prominent strain to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Holland in the nineties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than chem, NL, haze and skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I was a big one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was one of my one that I was
really interested in was purple star and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a a Dutch purple Afghani of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is kind of cheating because
I kind of think it's like modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly in the nineties,
you know, sour diesel in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Became, you know, it's it's a it's
possibly a blend of chem and skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's not the same, but it is it
is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not either one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became one of the most popular
strains in America during that time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard because when you say
NL, haze and skunk, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that have at least one of those
components in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not to name one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard not to name something that
doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but but if you're going to name
some of that stuff, you could probably
[SPEAKER_00]: throw in the white family that came out of
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, in the mid 90s,
the white widow, the great white shark,
[SPEAKER_00]: the white Russian, that whole line,
it doesn't have any NL haze or skunk that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was completely it was
different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all over high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was winning cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was getting blended into all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started growing white widow
and white rhino were the ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like that's what we're talking
about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, another thing is this this kind
of I think this angers DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, DJ gave DJ gave Tony from
Sag Martha a bunch of blueberry lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sag Martha started selling blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably for most people, that was
their first ability to actually purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't, you know, if he was giving it
to friends or people in his small network,
[SPEAKER_00]: it certainly wasn't as prevalent as giving
it to Sag Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, later on in the 90s, after he had
soured on Sag Martha, I believe Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: Passion took over some of his blueberry
work and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether or not he is appreciative
of that or not, certainly Sag Martha and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch Passion and their breath of sales
put blueberry and those lines on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave people access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave people the ability to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it made them it made him
essentially forum famous when Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: World and Overgrow were happening because
all of a sudden you could get these like
[SPEAKER_00]: these cool sounding strains with these
pretty colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that kind of stuff was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were those were pretty famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to say they certainly caught
Americans attention and they are also not
[SPEAKER_00]: NL, Chem, Hayes, or Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, most famous things
have a little Chem, Hayes, Skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Nano in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these are the building block
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to get away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one is all Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was Hobbs Breath creating or was
Hobbs Breath created using SSSC Genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I know for sure,
pretty sure is that Jimbo used Williams
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, whether it was Williams Wonder across
to a random NL, Williams Wonder across to
[SPEAKER_01]: an Afghani, Williams Wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: His story did change based on who we told,
but that was intentional.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did not want people recreating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cut was kept very tight until several
years after his passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is now out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: His sister has the Hobbs Breath Company
and her husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing an awesome job with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still getting all my Hobbs gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jim was a major influence on me,
for those who don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, Hobbs Breath is one of my
favorite all time strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe CRD underscore SD is going to be
doing some stuff with the Hobbs Breath
[SPEAKER_01]: family to bring it back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys talk about the 88 G13 Hash
Plant the Indian worked with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bode uses it as a male and I believe Hayes
man or someone else, even though they
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't supposed to be released pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The G13 Hash Plant was selected from
supposedly bought in 1988 by a Sensei,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was by Swampy, who was an old
overgrown member.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian was his friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian gets his name attached to a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what ends up happening is he asks
other breeders to send him free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He distributes them without the breeder's
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his name got stuck with it,
again, like the 88 G13 Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is the G13 Hash Plant, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice, that seed bank or was it seed
bank distributed in 88?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple things with this throw
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that there is no 88 G13 Hash Plant
in the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out in 89.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a year anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: But and from my understanding,
it had been sort of bred to F4 before Bode
[SPEAKER_00]: got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bode cracked them and did some.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't realize it had been bred to F4
and bottlenecked a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got it and he bred it and he bred it
a few times and he realized that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding work that he had done with it was
kind of bunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his best work with it, which is what
he crossed everything to and everybody has
[SPEAKER_00]: access to, was actually the initial seed
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did better with the initial batch of
seeds that he got because they'd already
[SPEAKER_00]: been heavily selected for than him trying
to work within the narrow pool post that
[SPEAKER_00]: he thought he was going F1 to F3,
maybe he was really going like F5 to F8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most of what you're getting
when you get stuff from Bode is the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial batch of seeds that he had got
that had already been narrowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know when they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't come from 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sold in 89 and in 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not sold by Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think until they needed Mr. Nice,
I believe, until they named it Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt and I discovered that that didn't
pop up in a Sensei catalog until almost
[SPEAKER_00]: 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was available for two years from
Neville Seed Bank in 89 and 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's probably where they come
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably a pack or two that the guy
bred with, you know, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not that big of a selection
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the it's obviously,
you know, I mean, Bode's had some great
[SPEAKER_00]: success breeding with some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also probably one of those ones where
there's not a bunch of places to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breed's very dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty purple, smaller budded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are large yielding, but I believe the
one that Bode uses imparts purple traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The deadly G male, I think he calls it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, for those that don't know,
Swampy, who originally put out those G13
[SPEAKER_01]: hash plant seeds, he also did a cross
called Free Leonard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the G13 hash plant
butterscotch wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the butterscotch wine was a
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one was phenomenal, phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Oren that worked with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Oren worked with it for a little bit
and has done some cool shit with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made his caramel line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people have since used the
caramel line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, yeah, that's about all I
can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question we'll go over very
quickly, because I think Matt and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: both kind of want to punt on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did Barney's farm ever have their own
in-house breeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they always been a bulk seed
reseller?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Matt or I have a super high
opinion of Barney's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've always kind of been a seed
reseller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they came in very late to the game
when the Dutch scene had already been
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly reduced from its golden and
even silver era.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of came in at the tail end of
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody that has actually
bred for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that they didn't have a
little bit of their own house stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean you couldn't have found good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly most of the Dutch seed banks
in the last 10 years have have certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: fallen off from what they were previous to
that in terms of what people find from
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next question, longevity on seeds and
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is quite easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put seeds in the fridge or the
freezer, you can extend their life by
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about every breeder I know that wants
longevity on his seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put them in the freezer or the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just trying to read the other
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen, Matt can speak to this,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is a lot more delicate than seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot more limited shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Rob's book, they talk about baking some
flour in the oven and then mixing that
[SPEAKER_00]: flour either 10 or 100 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then freezing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is a lot iffier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat, light, water all kills it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot less viable than a hard seed to
keep alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I'll say about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any way you want to store pollen that's
not fresh, there's various ways to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all iffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have some greater success than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ignore a few of these because they're just
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to, you know, TK,
OG, Urkel, Sour Diesel, those are all
[SPEAKER_00]: their own longer things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, do you think Mendopurpe is
possibly related to the purple skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only available in the original 85
catalog and it being inbred for eight
[SPEAKER_01]: years and the sativa effects of the purple
Hindu Kush type plant with those purple
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers sound similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like a lot of 90s stuff that you
get, the lineage and the back story that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would prefer to come along with it is
not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only information that I have that I
think is factual about the Mendopurpes is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the guy that I got it from grew it in
the late 70s in Kovalo, which is a remote
[SPEAKER_00]: valley in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything other about it
besides that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a famous Kovalo purple,
isn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there, you know, there was it's
sort of, you know, and part of the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why part of the I should say this,
too, is that a lot of the land race stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were talking about, a lot of it
tested between seven and 15 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really the blending of these
various land races and Afghans and these
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridizations that really started bumping
us up into the higher teens, lower 20s,
[SPEAKER_00]: mid 20s type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Mendopurpes, while it has
amazing qualities, it has very low THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably somewhere between eight and
12 percent if they're not bumping it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: which actually kind of lends it lends to
its truth that it could be an original
[SPEAKER_00]: land race brought over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have a region of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I've ever smelled in my
entire life that smelled like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendopurpes was the Nepalese temple balls
that I got from hash smugglers in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that it might be Nepalese
because of that, but I have absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: zero evidence pointing one way or the
other, other than the fact that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's purple skunk simply
because Matt and I have grown tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: skunks, various kinds of guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really have any other skunk
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Burkle is purple skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really genuinely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know CSI probably I think he is more
akin to something the X 18 or PTK,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's purple skunk one purple,
but I do not think Mendopurpes is purple
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so here's some funny ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Color and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you know, it's it's,
you know, OK, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that purple is extremely
physically attractive to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that the cookies and that the
stuff from DJ Short and his son JD can be
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lavenders, the pinks, the blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Mendopurpes is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think that those kinds of weed are as
potent and as strong as the green weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like very light to moderate
potency, it could be your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But literally every potent strain that I
hold and care for is some shade of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to see purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love I would love people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love people to breed an extremely
high potent potency purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple unicorn was the Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackberry widow from Jojo Rizzo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time I got Kim D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potency in a just stark purple plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure it could exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying as far as most purple
things that you're aware of, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: common.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be they tend to be lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Age of Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that question quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, you know, I'll talk about
this one for a minute, because this one's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's just because I was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the 90s was the Golden Age of
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I still think that we could go
into another Golden Age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's like it's it's
unachievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I think it was the Golden
Age is because it was like the first poly
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things were less inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a lot more F1s and
various poly hybrids coming out that were
[SPEAKER_00]: quite potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the you know, the chems, the sour
diesels, the NL five hazes like most of
[SPEAKER_00]: our famous, like very extremely famous
that the cushions they all originate from
[SPEAKER_00]: that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are still using a lot of 90s
cuts in their breed work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're some of the most common cuts to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of the backbone of our modern
industry is 90s cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I think that makes 90s
cuts different is that 90s was the last
[SPEAKER_00]: era before the name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt can speak to this extensively,
but one of the downsides to the name game
[SPEAKER_00]: is that every time a famous name or a
famous craze happens with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many cool, unique things that were easy
to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before get pushed to the wayside,
because as soon as something becomes not
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to sell, the amount of people that
are willing to hold on to it becomes tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'll give you guys a perfect
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I live in Mendocino County when
the when the purple craze hit in 040506.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wanted to grow Grape Ape,
Urkel, Lavender, you know, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all these hill people that had
been growing all these killer strains for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time and easily selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they couldn't sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their neighbor was like, hey,
you grow this Urkel, I'll sell as many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them as you can get every gram,
every gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me your Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these strains start to get
dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot a lot of the reason why we
still breed with 90s work is because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when the that's before the
bottlenecking happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, if you look at what people are
selling now, all these boutique breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: every famous thing gets crossed to every
famous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sour got crossed to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush got crossed to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies got crossed to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they start getting crossed to each
other from both sides again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush mints by this, by this, you know,
cherry pie by Cush mints by wedding cake
[SPEAKER_00]: by and it's all the same blend of the same
30 cuts unintentional inbreeding
[SPEAKER_00]: unintentional inbreeding because and
that's and I don't mean to call out
[SPEAKER_00]: readers because that's what the public
wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma definitely, Soma definitely had some
worthwhile offerings.
[SPEAKER_00]: His lavender stuff was worthwhile
reclining Buddha, reclining Buddha.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got he got some G 13 by Hayes A from
Neville that he used as a male and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sativa lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that came out to produce a
lot of the CBD lines later on that G 13
[SPEAKER_01]: Hayes milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when I used to go to
Amsterdam, you could buy his his bud from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Damkring, which was one of the nicer
coffee shops in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of his weed was quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because he keefed it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be nice to people, but he was he
was a little notorious for potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: running his tumbler for two or three
minutes before he put it in the bag to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell the thing so he could collect Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is a legitimate source for NL one NL
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem when I mentioned earlier on
the podcast, which is like every five or
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years, weed reinvents itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go look at almost all of these
catalogs from the 90s, and it is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to find the vast majority of
these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In seed form, you unhybridized pure skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it just is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it sucks to say it, but every 10
years, stuff becomes rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the 90s now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, most of the stuff that was available
in the 90s is no longer available today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists in various hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have a tendency to think that
Bubba Kush is has heavy NL one influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I think some of this stuff
exists in different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the sad part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't buy it and store it,
you might want it later on and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: History of the 1979 Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skip that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if CSI comes on at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspiring breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll skip that one, too, not because not
because it's a bad question, but it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't heard of any bud called
UFO in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about freeze drying
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's there's companies that
are that are claiming that freeze drying
[SPEAKER_00]: is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have specific methods of drying,
and it certainly doesn't involve freeze
[SPEAKER_00]: drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: When and who started making feminized
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Passion gives themselves credit for
it, but it was actually a man named Mohan
[SPEAKER_01]: Ram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember something set as ETT
that were first doing the scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments on plant reversal using
cobalt, colloidal, STS and several other
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so here's something that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will skip a couple of these,
not because they're not nice questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't know anything about the New
York recreational rules or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about the new
attorney general for our state yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Central American cannabis,
what's the importance of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican is is Central America and Mexican
has been bred into all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we use the other Central American
countries, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does exist, but it certainly didn't
have the impact in terms of breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: working with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly Honduran and El
Salvadorian and, you know, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panama's also is also technically central
is also technically Central America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two famous ones from Central
America that have a lot of influence and
[SPEAKER_00]: have been bred into a bunch are Mexican
and Panamanian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, cubing, cubing is sort of BXing
in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a bullshit concept,
but yeah, cubing is is great if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: true F1 and you want to isolate a single
one or two traits that that's effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you cube, then you then you cross
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's generally how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I always give this example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time people tend to think of C99
when they hear cubing because it was back
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed three or four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what the claim was from
Seoul, but it was all bullshit anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a sense, in a sense, you don't want
to take a line that has fucking a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos and try to cube it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get anywhere in four
steps back to isolate all the traits like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people confuse that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cubing isolate a few traits, crossing
forward, isolate multiple traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's really the best way I can
describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of ends most of the questions,
I think, for this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few we didn't get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think Urkel is super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel rips me to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other people might think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think it's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the more potent
purples, but I would not put it up against
[SPEAKER_00]: the more I would not even remotely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be in my top 10 or even 20
most potent strains that I've tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see for me, it's one of the top 10
that will instantly give me paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, it's just the way it
goes with my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy, there's a there's a
gentleman asking about, do you think land
[SPEAKER_00]: race seeds are still good at the source?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know anything about
those guys, but I certainly support people
[SPEAKER_00]: going around in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he talking about a specific company or
is he talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a company called Land
Race Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings stuff over from Afghanistan
and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that easy for white people to go
there and collect things right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we went to war with them for a
couple of decades, and so it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: sketchy with the Taliban and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fact that you have people that
are going to collect and send seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what will come of it,
but it's definitely an access point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go from there, you know,
and the difference in early Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the difference in early Colombian
haze and why it was better was it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: raw crosses and less inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a lot of mistakes made
in the 70s on accident as people learned
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't use large enough population
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been documented that a lot of
the best phenos that the haze guys liked
[SPEAKER_00]: started disappearing in the mid to late
70s because they made some some poor
[SPEAKER_00]: choices with selections and they weren't
sure what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The South Indian stuff has kind of been
debunked now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam is saying that it was always colo by
colo, Colombian by Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's saying that this four way blend is a
bunch of bunk and it's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't speak to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the end of the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy that said that Mexico is
North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm aware that that that they don't
consider Central America a continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since the question was asked about
what came from Central America that was
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial, you know, if people are
talking about Central America,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty much Panama to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize it's all either North or South
America as the way that geography would
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just trying to answer the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Durban stuff we're going to ignore
simply because we have some stuff coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I think will shed a lot more light on
the Durban thing next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't want to chat on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like something relatively close.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be some really good new
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can talk about it now since
most of it's in the can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about it real quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plug it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could plug it really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we were blessed and we have
been able to interview the founder of
[SPEAKER_00]: SuperCitiva Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of our like 80s breeding
program, Neville's obviously passed,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we weren't able to interview him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Neville and SuperCitiva
Seed Club were the two largest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a quite long interview coming
that we're going to be giving some context
[SPEAKER_00]: to where we ask him a bunch of questions
about some very famous strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was like back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff that surprised even Matt
and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: New information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super engaging and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to edit it a little bit in various
ways just for, you know, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of stuff that's going to
come out that's super neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that's going to
come out that, you know, that might make
[SPEAKER_00]: people sad or flip some stories that have
been kind of accepted on their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think the Durban thing is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so we'll sort of save that
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Durban story is a little wider
than we once thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have that interview coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was super cool to chat with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll really flesh out what life was like
back then and what breeding was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of the two biggest seed
banks in the world in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited to be able to
bring that stuff to you guys in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, so I don't know that kind
of like that kind of takes us to that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of takes us to sort of the end of like our
arc here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We answered a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have again, you want to want to be a
part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be a part of some of the
research we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see a lot of them like I a
lot of people know I collect a lot of old
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know, like old cannabis
memorabilia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I post a lot of the shots from those books
in there like as I come across them cool
[SPEAKER_01]: shit that adds to the history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a depository.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on with a lot of old
catalogs a lot of old magazines a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: old books that are inaccessible to most
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the merch up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can click by syndicate merch right
under one of our heads and it should take
[SPEAKER_01]: you there and you can buy a hat shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that helps support us this shit
cost money to do and we're actually like I
[SPEAKER_01]: just bought a new mic that I couldn't use
this time to do other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does cost money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you support the more we can do
and the more we are appreciative and we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do more giveaways and cool shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, throw some one basic plug is that
you know, if you guys can't figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to join you can always send it a DM to
Matt or myself on IG or breeder syndicate
[SPEAKER_00]: or breeder syndicate will share the link
that will take you right to where you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have our own like we have our
own chat in there where you can ask us
[SPEAKER_00]: questions all the time and we chop it up
with people on a much more regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our point to all this is to get
information out there and talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that interests us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you can't find it for some
reason give Matt or myself a shout and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll send you a link and point you on the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope everybody enjoyed listening to
a longer thing and just hit us up and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see you guys there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As someone said not so accept my follow or
have three years bad luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: DM me on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like over a thousand I have over a
thousand people waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not intentional but if you hit me up
personally and I can chat with you for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second I'll accept you and we'll go from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link at the bottom that breeder
syndicate just put up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the thing to pledge at if you
can't if you want to send us a link we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: send you a link to and we're going to be
doing this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have some shorts coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have some cool interviews
with some old schoolers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have more lives that are
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be some variety and
content coming some more interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know like I said some short topics
some more long winded shit like this
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an hour and 50 minutes long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just going to we're going to
start adding adding to it over time and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make it cooler and hopefully
everybody enjoyed listening while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea of keeping us all on an
even playing field when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys like to secret squirrel that
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want everyone on an even playing field
to be able to make the best weed possible
[SPEAKER_01]: because if everybody's making good weed we
can all build off each other's shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys for showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all hope you have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
