[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just that chunk of crap?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was like, it was like I was
connected with everything around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, I just started
questioning everything I'd ever been told.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, by the time, by the time I got
high, that very first time, when it
[SPEAKER_03]: started to hit me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here with Jay from Next Generation
Seeds, formerly of Federation Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming on the show,
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're, you're someone we've wanted to
talk to for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't, we have not covered BC in super
depth and you're one of the people that
[SPEAKER_05]: was super integral in that scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Responsible for most of, at least maybe
you're responsible for bringing it to seed
[SPEAKER_05]: most of what is still being used today
from the BC area, I should say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd love to talk with you about some
of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe start with the early Federation time
and maybe a little bit before that and
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about what got you into weed,
what Canada was like when you got into
[SPEAKER_05]: weed, all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Canada, as you know, is a big
country like the U S and we have vastly
[SPEAKER_04]: different cultures depending on where you
live in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew up on the Canadian prairies in
a very conservative community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our weed was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very expensive and you have to deal
with shady people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our dream as a young stoner growing up
in Manitoba is to go to the West coast
[SPEAKER_04]: where all the good stuff came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I moved out of Vancouver,
I just immersed myself into it
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just tried to learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was fortunate enough to get a job at
Mark Emery's hemp BC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just hired as the kid in the
back as the carpenter, building things,
[SPEAKER_04]: wiring up the grow kits, building
hydroponic systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of my first year just
getting to know growers all throughout
[SPEAKER_04]: British Columbia and the West coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: What year did you say that was?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would have been 95, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 95.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I spent about a half of six months to
a year doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, as soon as I could,
I started my own grow up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And together with Mike from Federation,
me and that together, I would collected as
[SPEAKER_04]: many clones as we could get our hands on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed a lot of the people in BC
were so spoiled that they could they could
[SPEAKER_04]: they would drop, take a really good clone
and then not keep mothers of it because
[SPEAKER_04]: they can just get by another tray of
drinks for the next crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody had grains and me as somebody
where it's extremely rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just gathered everything I get my hands
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And within a year, I probably had over 60
different mother strains go and then
[SPEAKER_04]: testing them and dropping the ones that
were shit and keeping the good ones as you
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then then Mike and I just started
Federation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That only lasted with me about a year and
a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went our separate ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: After that, I started Next Generation
right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And moved to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Island away from the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's got into a really hardcore ever
since.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just I was just a collector of
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was obsessive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also collecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us, when we get into breeding,
like especially with me, I know I dove in
[SPEAKER_05]: head first.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted I wanted to see everything,
you know, like collected moms kept like
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of moms of everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took a long time to start sorting
through this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have that excitement and vigor at
the beginning of just I want everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to see it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were some of the ones like the very
first clones you started getting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we had a few like the sweet pink
grapefruit Romulan from Romulan Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was Romulan Joe for a while and some
Hawaiian sativas that came through Mr. G
[SPEAKER_04]: Man there from the Island Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a lot of good crosses that are
phenomenal in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of the most underrated breeders
from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we talk about him for a quick sec?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to give him a little bit of shine
because that's someone like even I this
[SPEAKER_05]: far in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know how integral Mr. G was into
all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole Vancouver, not just Vancouver
Island specifically, but the BCC.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much of his genetics played a role in
creating the larger supply?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and a lot of people, while he's an
old timer, he's very, very quiet,
[SPEAKER_04]: very private.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's connected with all kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just kept his head down and did
good work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of his clones and cuts got
passed around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would sometimes make a lot of
crosses that he never himself never had
[SPEAKER_04]: time to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he'd give it to other growers,
here, test these out, test these out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we received some good seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The original Hawaiian sativa came from
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Burmese, he had a beautiful Burmese.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a few other growers have copied his
Burmese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he the source for the Burmese that went
around BC?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was the first one that I know that
had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had it before, I believe,
before a reefer man had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was the source of the grandparents
of the original god bud and a lot of those
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I bred.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had my grape god cross, but I didn't
breed it with the grape god clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bred it with the parents of the grape
god.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's some confusion with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine's slightly different from the god
bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little more fruity, a little more
stink to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were the grandparents of the god bud?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's lots of rumors, and there's
a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a strain that he called Jiffy
Pot, which I always told him was not a
[SPEAKER_04]: very good name.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can come up with a better name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he already sold any of those Jiffy Pot
seeds, even though they were some of his
[SPEAKER_04]: best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Names are everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a few other growers had the clone,
and they did a few crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it got renamed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different groups of growers named it
different things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: After that, some growers called it
A-Frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some were just calling it Purple Stunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the grandchildren of it,
the granddaughter, I guess, is what became
[SPEAKER_04]: known as the god bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was via... The only one I've ever
heard of those was the people from Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: have talked to me about the Purple Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's different generations or
groups of growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's two different sections,
different groups of genetics that were
[SPEAKER_04]: both called Purple Skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very common name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything with purple and skunk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like Purple Kush up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there an early, just single Purple
Kush clone that was brought up there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that was brought up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Reefer Man would probably know a
lot more about that than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had one of the first Purple Skunks in
the island pink, I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that was bred out of something
that he calls King.
[SPEAKER_04]: The King, bud, or King?
[SPEAKER_05]: I had that written down here to ask you
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the King.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just not really too sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in different circles of
communities, but we might run into each
[SPEAKER_04]: other quite often.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually chat now more than we did
back then.
So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have you going on in to Federation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a little bit of interaction with
another person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how early on did you start interacting
with like Romulan Joe and Romulan,
[SPEAKER_05]: the clones?
[SPEAKER_05]: First Romulan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that was very... That was even
before we... That was the start of
[SPEAKER_04]: Federation seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hadn't had a seed company and Romulan
Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just, like I say, I was a young kid
building hydro equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Romulan Joe, I would just buy my
personal smoke off of him every week when
[SPEAKER_04]: he came to town.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said one weekend he needed help
harvesting and moving his crop from
[SPEAKER_04]: Vancouver Island over to the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went and helped him for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And me and my buddy Mike were talking
about starting a seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Romulan was all the rave at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Romulan Joe sold us the clone for
$7,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a couple of cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave us a few cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was $7,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was our flagship strain that we
started with and kind of built our company
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it made a big difference in the world
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that was one of the ones I chased
really early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know that we ever saw the real
Romulan Pure clone in the West.
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was so many rumors about
that clone and where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very hard back in like the
forum days and stuff and even earlier to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was rumors that like the
guy Romulan Joe was actually called
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino Joe and came from me and came
from Rings and Eyes County and fled to
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada when a bunch of bus went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was Canadians that said
that was bull.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was definitely not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just one of those ones that there
was a lot of rumor and there was very
[SPEAKER_00]: little fact coming out where someone who
like knew for sure would come out and just
[SPEAKER_00]: say what needed to be said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allowed all these stories to
percolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became extremely legendary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Romulan Joe was very secretive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just kind of got a kick out of all
the stories that go around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually seen him a few months ago
and I stopped by his place for a smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told him about some of the rumors
because I had somebody from the States
[SPEAKER_04]: that breeds Romulan telling this story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told Joe about this and he just
shook his head and laughed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that person's claiming they
bred it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like it's from their family or some
wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendocino Joe's their family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things in cannabis is since we
all come out of the shadows, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to have facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people come out with a big story and
they want to chat about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes there's opposing stories to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the people, like you said,
are just secretive and old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're older and don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you a story what Romulan Joe
told me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a new grower from Eastern Canada,
moved to Vancouver Island outside of
[SPEAKER_04]: Victoria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was taken under the wing of some of
the old timers back then in the would have
[SPEAKER_04]: been late 80s, late mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when he first encountered the Romulan,
it was a couple of older fellows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think one of them's passed and they
started off growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were pre Korean war vets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They moved back to Canada into the
cannabis and all they had was Mexican and
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they started trying to breed with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had very, very little luck,
small buds, but they got faster and faster
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was still basically sativa like the
Colombian red and Mexican sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the early 80s, I believe it
was 82 or 83, when the first Afghanis
[SPEAKER_04]: started coming over and they crossed out
their variety that they'd been working on
[SPEAKER_04]: with an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they did a massive grow out,
I believe in 84.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it shortened it and made it workable
that they could grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never really had lights going back
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all in greenhouses on the South
Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a runoff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the smallest plant of the batch
that they kept the cutting of.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the smallest plant in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said kind of the most finicky as
well, as far as pH goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was so extremely strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they kept that cut from 1984.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or sorry, pardon me, 1984.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they never even, actually the first
few years, he said, they never even gave
[SPEAKER_04]: it a name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never had a name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Romulan Joe said in the late 80s,
when he was sitting around helping them
[SPEAKER_04]: trim one day, and they're watching TV,
trimming, and they're watching Star Trek,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they started joking about how this
stuff will knock out, put a dent in your
[SPEAKER_04]: head, just like a Romulan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was when they first got coined as
a Romulan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just kind of stuck from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how these names can be formed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the story Joe's told me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can confirm even now I'm doing some grow
outs with some Colombian genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed a lot with, the structure
has absolutely nothing to like the old
[SPEAKER_04]: school sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the high that you get from that
Romulan, it was like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: different, the Colombian regs that I've
grown and the Punto Rojo, get the very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very similar smell and high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously nothing close to the same
growth structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the flavor really reminds me of the
Colombian red that I'm growing right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was the Romulan like a squat little thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Very squat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was one of the more Afghani type
structure selections?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And low yield as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after we did about five or six
backcrosses into it, we noticed every time
[SPEAKER_04]: we used our mostly Romulan male,
on a female of another variety,
[SPEAKER_04]: that smell and potency would come across.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the structure would follow the female.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he did it the other way around
and used the original Romulan as the
[SPEAKER_04]: female, it was a lot more unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually talked for a long time
amongst our crew, like as a running joke
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, how when you're breeding,
you're looking at things and there's all
[SPEAKER_00]: these big impressive plants that throw the
kind of structure and bud you want all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this like little runt
mutant thing that you think about killing
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thing ends up being the clear
winner over everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like it's an ode to runts and
it's an ode to like mutants and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because often from a production
standpoint, all the qualities you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for, you don't find the quality of
smoke in effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often in those, you find them much
more often in the weird ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm shocked they have the foresight to
like know to keep the runt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like even back then, a lot of the
old wise tales were, yeah, kill the
[SPEAKER_05]: unsteady ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill the, you know, as fast as you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get those ones out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as a seedling, then people would
be killing the runt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the foresight to know that what
you see isn't necessarily what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to get in the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may have other traits that are really
amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned that as well with indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get rid of the runt right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: With outdoors, you're looking for more
outdoor vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll kind of call them pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for indoors, no, you gotta wait and
see what they can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wouldn't have things like OGKB or
Urkel, any of the weird stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if we didn't keep the runt
around the weirdos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, you know, effect is invisible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of one of the weird things
about cannabis is until you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: dry it and cure it and smoke it,
you really don't know what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know if the way it smells
translates into the way it tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you definitely don't know how,
what effect it's going to give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can learn some things by watching,
but it kind of takes dried flour or hash
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get you to where you want to be
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, to give you the proper feedback.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to have rings because he had my,
he, he lives actually down the street from
[SPEAKER_00]: me and he has a ton of experience growing
your work.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a big next generation fan,
massive next generation fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been a outdoor from seed kind
of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that he doesn't do indoor,
but he never really got huge into the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although he does keep clones, he always
likes growing from seed and breeding every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of the three of us, he probably had
the most experience in actually growing
[SPEAKER_00]: out stuff you've made and seeing what he
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, I was mainly a federation guy back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew a lot of federation like the,
and that's what I want to go over with
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these, because the number one
thing that people were asking,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're going to get, you're going to
get someone who knows about federation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know about these specific
strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want, if I can run through these
with you real quick, just say kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: first, first few sentences that come to
your head on each.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to go into more detail on
any feel free, uh, mccado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that was basically our version of the,
uh, sweet pig grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically our, uh, semi it was F
four when we released it at four
[SPEAKER_04]: backcross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that, yeah, it's basically the
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, dynamite.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that next generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynamite is next generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I left federation, I renamed it,
uh, dynamite, uh, instead of calling it
[SPEAKER_04]: mccado or grapefruit because people were
upset about if you're using somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: else's name, you can't call it grapefruit
or I'm going to send somebody to visit you
[SPEAKER_04]: type of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll change the name, but I wrote it in my
description.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our version of the original
grapefruit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what's about the best you can do
at that point?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you get it, people get so
upset.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at first, when I released it,
instead of calling, I called the
[SPEAKER_04]: grapefruit and yeah, I said, this is the
grapefruit first made famous by greeter
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve of spice of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I just, I was giving him credit and
letting people know where, and I was kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of naive, I guess.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he got upset saying, oh,
wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're using that name, you owe me
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just giving you credit for this
genetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Change the names.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you learn your way through toe
stepping in, in the seed world,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no written rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like each person has their own rules
and you better know it ahead of time or
[SPEAKER_00]: else it's interesting because so many name
changes happened either from just that
[SPEAKER_00]: very thing where you change seed companies
and somebody has a trademark or there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get upset about the same name or in
some cases, like a little on a little
[SPEAKER_00]: shadier note, uh, seed breeders don't want
people to know the origin stock of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're releasing because they don't want
to give credit and they don't want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: a percentage or they don't want to deal
with any bulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just like make up their own name
and then there you go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like to give credit to where I,
how would I created it from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everything we have was built on
somebody else's work that came before us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it's just a matter of letting
people know and being honest about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, I was my philosophy behind it,
but yeah, there is a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of strains nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that there's something in there
that they're not telling you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, probably a lot in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's been that way for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've even talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How like in, uh, you know, Neville would
just say what things were in Europe and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that came after him in Holland
kind of obscured things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I want to like,
Matt and I did like a kind of a two part
[SPEAKER_00]: thing on the history of, uh, of seed
banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we got to Canada, we realized we
didn't know enough about the internal
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics to like talk intelligently about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely come from that era where
like, say looking at like Mark Emery's
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine, you know, you would open those
up and you would see those catalogs and
[SPEAKER_00]: you would see all the traditional
Amsterdam stuff that they brought over and
[SPEAKER_00]: were reselling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, there would be,
um, you know, there would be all these
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six different new Canadian
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had all the, yeah, a lot of the
stuff that came over from this,
[SPEAKER_04]: from Holland and after, I know some of the
guys that were doing all the moving of the
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can guarantee that a lot of those
genetics are not what it says on the
[SPEAKER_04]: package.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, when it comes to the Dutch,
when it comes to all this imported Dutch
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff back in those days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but as far as the Canadian,
uh, homegrown companies, um, there,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was pretty much straight up and
pretty honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and cause people were doing their own
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some guys in the Kootenays,
there's the Mighty Might Boys,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Vancouver Island Seed Company and a
few of the others that they were giving
[SPEAKER_04]: you what it says on the package.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but not so much with the Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dutch would even joke sometimes,
uh, when they're selling to Canadians in
[SPEAKER_04]: bulk, that they just go to the back room
and they have their indica bucket and
[SPEAKER_04]: their sativa bucket and they come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've told people this for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't believe me when I say this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they really did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they like, what's closer to Jack
Herrer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's Skunk Haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Close enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, it is, it really is how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just, you know, like somebody like
we've heard people talk about how like
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Emery would get orders for seeds and
have run out of the particular thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: they had requested, but he still wanted to
make the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, Oh, this is close enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll buy it off one of the local guys
and then, uh, and then repackage it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty typical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was never back in those days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Emery never had anything in original
packaging because everything was smuggled
[SPEAKER_04]: and none of us seed breeders were
organized enough to, to make packaging and
[SPEAKER_04]: risky thing to do back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then keeping the packaging in your
house for proof.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people my age would get those
magazines and would literally pour over
[SPEAKER_00]: every single blurb about each of the seeds
and create lists of dreams that you wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: because it, it was kind of like
pre-internet or very early internet as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as forums go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so information was limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the Canadian seed breeders
kind of came on the scene, at least as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as access for Americans, all of a sudden
there was this plethora of new stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that like, you were like,
Oh, what about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, Oh, I want some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw some beautiful purple stuff coming
from Canada too, cause I was a purple
[SPEAKER_05]: fiend and I remember federation next
generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there was one great white seed co
maybe a great North that had a lethal
[SPEAKER_05]: purple or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: White grizzly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they did a few of the cootney
breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one guy from, um, the cootneys
that used to work with Steve, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: he goes by cootney OG on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was great, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, Matt, there was even
rumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I believe them or not,
but there's a story in Mendocino in my
[SPEAKER_00]: area that some of the early purples that
came over and became famous in my neck of
[SPEAKER_00]: the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had some Canadian origins to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to verify if that was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but some of that purple skunk,
some of those purples, especially some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that was growing up there in BC
indoor scene, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, there are some old rumors of
origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's one of the reasons why the
stories have never come out about like
[SPEAKER_00]: which person in Humboldt or Mendo or
whatever actually made it because it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of came down from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, before Osama bin Laden
ruined flying, because there was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I was thinking about
when, uh, Jay was talking was that just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously we're all, we're North
Americans, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the Canadian side and the,
and the American side and there's these
[SPEAKER_00]: two big weed cultures, but they have
differences, but there's this border in
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the Canadians aren't very
friendly with letting in certain Americans
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on their past, you know,
and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and, you know, and then,
but it was more porous in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the terrorist attacks
happened, they really tightened up the
[SPEAKER_00]: border and they really made it more
difficult for interaction, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially that five or 10 years after it
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, you know, even mailing seed or
getting over the border or exchange of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant matter or what have you,
uh, became a lot dicier than it was
[SPEAKER_04]: before, you know, uh, before we had a lot
of, a lot of problems.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, before they were kind of worried
about Mexico, but they weren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canada, the border was kind of like,
ah, you know, it's Americans and Canadians
[SPEAKER_00]: are just crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they took it a little bit more
serious because they got worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: people using that like porous nature to
get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the weed game a little different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I remember when, uh, I remember,
uh, when, uh, back in John Walters was the
[SPEAKER_04]: drug czar right before nine 11 or right
around then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but actually it was before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still in the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and Mark Emory had been getting busted
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he loved being in the media.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was on CNN news and our all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and we get rated all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember one year after a second or
third bust, um, they came in and the drugs
[SPEAKER_04]: are said, we're taking down these
Canadian, uh, seed cartels.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call them seed cartels and all the
seed cartels in Canada are equivalent to
[SPEAKER_04]: narco terrorists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every seed they sell is a thousand dollars
worth of marijuana on the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember, uh, Mark Emory,
he held a huge party when, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: when we got called, uh, narco,
uh, narco terrorists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mark Emory took that as a great
compliment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he threw one of the biggest parties we
ever had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I probably would do the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably would do the same, but it
would, I would regret it, but I probably
[SPEAKER_05]: would have done the same like in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a reason, there's a reason
why a lot of the old timers who are free,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, chose silence and secrecy
because, you know, being invisible is a
[SPEAKER_00]: real superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, once they shine the light on
you, it's pretty bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the old growers, like,
uh, G man, they're from that Cooper Island
[SPEAKER_04]: seed cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these guys too, they started back
in the eighties where you could be serious
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and we have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are a lot more other things to
lose as well, businesses and family.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, they were just used to not even
still, they still don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's how you're conditioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have more on your list,
Matt, that we kind of got sidetracked or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, but maybe we could tangent back
to it and you could ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Celestial temple sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, that was very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very, um, supposedly the rumor was
it was seeds from Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We crossed that when we first released
that it was, uh, our grapefruit F4 male in
[SPEAKER_04]: Federation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used that as, uh, the male that
pollinated the second, just extremely nice
[SPEAKER_04]: strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was lost and it ended up in one of
my collections that ended up being lost in
[SPEAKER_04]: a, in a divorce.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost half my seat collection,
uh, in the divorce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one of the strains I lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, very, very nice strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody still has genetics of that
kicking around, that would be very,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, we'll put our ears out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a long reach with the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you, like we were just talking about
early Pearl the other day and something's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, yeah, I got F2s.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got F6.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and they're legit ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, it's kind of neat how that
works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, BC Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not exactly sure where that came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came from, um, uh, the Asian community
in Vancouver when I got the, the cut and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's rumors that it was a big bud,
but it was just so extremely, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the best way to, best way,
like creamy, a creamy, creamy smooth
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would get you nice and high,
but not a confusing guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I considered it for myself, daytime smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I can still function.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can still do math.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can still drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a silver pearl type high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was nice and round and bulbous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, was it super dense too?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like mega dense?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very dense, very dense, but not,
not the stinkiest strain growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why a lot of the Asian production
growers liked it because it would get very
[SPEAKER_04]: huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not stink up the whole neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of the other varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'd be a big red flag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today have a really hard time accepting
that a lot, that a lot of old famous
[SPEAKER_00]: things, uh, to use a term that's very
common today, weren't very turpy that low
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, low odor was actually a big
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because you definitely didn't want to
pull up to your spot and get out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: car and smell it before you went into the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people used to think of low odor and,
and, and, you know, low terpenes or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is sometimes a benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the production growers in the
city.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are a production grower in the
city, uh, growing something for export,
[SPEAKER_04]: but most of the good old boys living in
the country, we wanted the Turks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another part of it too is that,
you know, if you got a big yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: resinous, thick, dense thing that's
smelled like nothing, you could safely
[SPEAKER_00]: cross that to something much turpier and
hope that those terpenes crossed over and
[SPEAKER_00]: would show up because they, it wouldn't
have any turps to interfere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were looking for like the resin and
the density and the production and hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: that the effect and the flavor came over
from the other side of the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what we did with our
Romulan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used what he made the Romulan BC push
cross used the mail from the Romulan and
[SPEAKER_04]: it lent a lot of the potency and a lot of
the smell, but it kept with that BC push
[SPEAKER_04]: size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, very, very nice way to,
that was a nice cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still, I still produce it, but I don't
have the original BC push cut anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that's, yeah, I still produce a
version of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's cool that you've, you've,
you've found a way to keep your lines
[SPEAKER_05]: going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even when stuff gets lost, you know,
your lines well enough to be able to work
[SPEAKER_05]: them, to get them back to where you feel
comfortable saying this represents that
[SPEAKER_05]: line well enough to be that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a few, a few varieties I'd
like to get back, but haven't been able
[SPEAKER_04]: to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, which ones, which ones,
uh, my bonkers, definitely my bonkers
[SPEAKER_04]: strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was by, it was, it was one of the first
strains I read on a large scale outdoors
[SPEAKER_04]: on Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was across the, the first mail I
used was a Burmese grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the male and the female was
from, uh, some growers in, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: the prairies of Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a purple motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called crossed with, uh,
uh, early sativa, which is basically a
[SPEAKER_04]: very fast version of the Durban.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what early sativa was?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was basically a super fast Durban.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way different than the Durbans that they
have now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a short squat one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was cool, but that's what it
actually was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was very, very leafy, leafy,
just like the purple motherfucker and the
[SPEAKER_04]: purple motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was always grown from seed because
you couldn't keep it tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the, the resonance on that between
the Burmese and the resonance of the
[SPEAKER_04]: purple motherfucker, uh, it was just
astounding that the leaves, even the fan
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves had crystal right out to the ends.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I first made that the first four
way cross and I grew a massive crop on
[SPEAKER_04]: Vancouver Island outdoors in one of the
wettest parts of the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the buds only, they came out the size
of footballs, the top buds and even the
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller buds at the bottom was the size of
a pop cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, but just the production was just
massive, but the first few years it was
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of airy from the purple motherfucker
and the early sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew in a wet part of the island.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that first year I lost about half of my
crop to mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was all seeded.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I selected, uh, my best seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after about the third or fourth
generation of breeding that into itself
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors, I was in the wettest and wettest
of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still 90% of plants had not a drop
of botrytis or mold on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just from going through the first few
years of just culling out those traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it became really well known,
um, around Canada anyway, for the amount
[SPEAKER_04]: of resonant and the terpene level was
through the roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so a lot of people would use it to
make hash, uh, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, that's one strain I didn't lose as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, uh, I've had, I've had customers
come to me and send me seeds and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I still make your bonkers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they send me some, I try it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like, not like, not like it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, the only people that I know that
actually have seeds of it put away is Ari
[SPEAKER_04]: in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and yeah, good luck on getting them
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: My business partner is actually pretty
decent friends with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, Ari is like, well, I don't have,
I have so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have time to go dig in through
that or send an employee.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Ari and has such a large catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I first moved to Holland and I
did a seed trade with them, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually with Milo from, uh, made the
cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I traded 500 to my bonkers with,
for the cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Milo didn't have, uh,
time and he ended up just giving them to
[SPEAKER_04]: Ari and putting them in his vault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the only place that I know for
sure that there's a good, a good
[SPEAKER_04]: generation of it there, state of it stored
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, man, I'd love to know what's actually
in his vault and what it actually is,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like some of that early,
early silver Pearl stuff and early Pearl
[SPEAKER_05]: and early girl get my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically every old original person I
would love to know what they still have
[SPEAKER_00]: and what, what their little seed vault
contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause everyone claims they have,
not everyone, many people claim they have
[SPEAKER_00]: everything unchanged from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously as we all know, the truth is
a bit different than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but pockets of stuff exists and some
people are very generous and some people
[SPEAKER_00]: are like, I have it and you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sitting there until I decide to
do something with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the one Dutch company that I have a
lot of respect, a lot of respect for is
[SPEAKER_04]: the Flying Dutchman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not sure, uh, I'm not forget his
name, but I've tried a lot of his genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the day and, uh, in Holland itself
and in Europe, he's got an extremely good
[SPEAKER_04]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few coffee shops where you can
go and get the real strand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go, yes, this is the real master
course from, you know, 1983 or whenever it
[SPEAKER_04]: was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got the original proper cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I really liked, uh, the Dutch
companies now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pot of gold and the real McCoy from,
from them, you know, uh, we found multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice versions in those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, there was a time when,
uh, I liked the Flying Dutchman quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked their sativas, uh, Fumar con Dios,
Fumar con Diablo, their, uh, their
[SPEAKER_04]: original skunk haze crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and that's what my haze that I use in
my grapefruit haze cross, my Romulan haze
[SPEAKER_04]: is from that over 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flying Dutchman skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your grapefruit haze made it down to
Southern California, down to San Diego in,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, mid two thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it got pretty big down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got your guys grapefruit haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Closer to the 2010 probably, actually,
when I started seeing it at collectors,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it got big down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's a special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, cotton candy federation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was basically it's an F2,
uh, sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sweet tooth blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet tooth blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then back across into the sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sweet tooth again.
So.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you said it was sweet tooth number
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hawaiian sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we went over that a little bit,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was from, um, that was from
Vancouver Island Seed Company.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually had, I believe, I believe that
was an F3 back cross when we, when we
[SPEAKER_04]: released it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So probably 80 something percent Hawaiian
sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's another story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a Hawaiian sativa now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not quite like the original back
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I wish I had something a little
closer, but, uh, very special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buddy just reproduced those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buddy just reproduced those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he'd be happy to send you some of
the reproduction up and see if it's
[SPEAKER_05]: anything like, uh, the original.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I see Reeferman was saying the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This Reeferman is down in Jamaica right
now and he's trying to bring back,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the old lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's testing out all these other
sativa varieties in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was chatting with him the other
day, he mentioned, uh, that he had some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these old Hawaiian sativas as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Island sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still one of my best sellers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, I bet that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh, you know, I've had that one from
day one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the sweet skunk number four from
spice of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: That first year when Steve made the,
uh, sweet skunk, there was about three or
[SPEAKER_04]: four different cuts that he selected that
went around for a few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was the most sativa phenotype out
of all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I kept and started working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, it's still one of my favorites,
still one of my best yielding strains as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, it's, uh, would you consider a
hazy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely a real lemony hazy,
like similarities to some of the super
[SPEAKER_04]: sulfur hazes even.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Jack Harriers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard that it, we've heard that it's
like, uh, it's based on NL five haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, we hear different things from
different Canadians.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the rumors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you'd have to ask, uh,
Steve or, uh, uh, uh, red, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would probably know a little bit more
than me about the exact background of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just reserved, received one of the
clones, uh, in 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I heard, also heard that the
rumor that's NL haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's lots of good stuff that came
from NL five haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just made me mention that too,
because when you said it was like one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the haze, one is one of the most sativa
ones and it tasted a lot, very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it doesn't mean it's true,
but it like, it definitely lends some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some points to it maybe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I kind of wanted to mention
just real quick, because, uh, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting is, you know, I was talking
about the line between Canada and America,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, but as America starts to
legalize and all these different states,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially like on the East coast and the,
and the, you know, New England and New
[SPEAKER_00]: York and some of these areas that are a
lot wetter, they keep trying to import
[SPEAKER_00]: California bread strains, which got
developed in a very arid climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always thought that people North
of the border will probably have genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you were talking about like,
Oh, I was growing on the rainiest ass part
[SPEAKER_00]: of this Island and we were breeding for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by three or four years in,
we got some stuff that was resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, in the West coast,
we don't have very much of that because it
[SPEAKER_04]: never rains in summer, but in Oregon state
or Washington state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in California, I mean, but in,
you know, places like New York and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast where summer is very humid,
they're probably going to end up wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to breed in Canadian work into their stuff
because a lot of that stuff will have
[SPEAKER_00]: resistances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, my, uh, a colleague of mine here that
runs that golden hat seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he's originally from Oregon,
Mr. Uh, Ron Harrington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, uh, this last summer did a massive
grow out with a bunch of, uh, American
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strains right next to some of mine and
some of his, and he said most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: American bread ones that were from
California or Colorado or a few of these
[SPEAKER_04]: other places, he said, they just were
inundated with molds and we tried us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, my varieties of auto flowers,
where he said not a drop of mold on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that goes back to, yeah,
it picks up those traits after years of
[SPEAKER_04]: selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, you select because you have to,
nobody wants to lose 50 to 75% of their
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start breeding with the ones that
survived it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, by third, fourth
generation, you get to a point where you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a speck of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard in California to breed for those
traits because it doesn't rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lived for, uh, for nine years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lived in Spain and it's similar latitude
as, as Northern California around San
[SPEAKER_04]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, except in Spain, the difference is
they have really high humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so a lot of my varieties did really
well there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, it was really neat to grow my
strains down in a completely different
[SPEAKER_04]: climate, but everywhere I, I've grown
long-term has been very humid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, cause the coast of Valencia there
where I lived, it's, it's regularly 70,
[SPEAKER_04]: 80% humidity, uh, and 35 degrees outside
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so, uh, yeah, I haven't, uh,
right now where I'm living in,
[SPEAKER_04]: in, uh, Alberta, Canada, it's very dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is probably the driest climate
I've grown in, uh, in my whole 25 years of
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I miss, I miss growing in a humid
climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's hard for me to get my rooms
up past 40% humidity in my indoor grow
[SPEAKER_04]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really hard to dry and cure your
butt here in this climate as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I, I have good friends in
Colorado who have similar dryness issues
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and keeping their dry rooms moist
enough for long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get that slow dry, you know,
um, and your weed doesn't turn into dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, dryness is a huge, is a huge positive
in my opinion, once you get late into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, but when you're early in veg,
I think more humidity is actually helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: to get small plants to vigorously grow
because they don't dry out and crisp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: If my, uh, bedroom goes up in humidity,
I don't worry about it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, but in the flower room,
the dryer, I can get it the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: UBC chemo back to the list.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know anything about chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew it for a few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ended up dropping it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I just was never impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I thought it was a way overrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of brown hair, no resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, I'm not particularly fond of
that earthy flavor of strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something I like myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the spicy or the fruity strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just very dull tasting to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after I started next generation,
um, I didn't, that was one of the clones I
[SPEAKER_04]: dropped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's other people that would know
more than me about that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, how about a time warp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, very, very underrated, uh,
very impressive strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very underrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have a jar left here actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it, what's it taste like and smell
like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the trip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, slightly piney, a little like a
floral, uh, perfumey in some ways.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I think one of the reasons that it
stuck around for so long on, in,
[SPEAKER_04]: in British Columbia was, uh, it's one of
those strains that, uh, you can store for
[SPEAKER_04]: long periods and it'll keep its flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't lose the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so when everybody is harvesting in
September and October, the prices
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously go down for when you're selling
your weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So time warp is one of those, you could
dry it, pop it in the freezer and six
[SPEAKER_04]: months later or next summer when it's dry,
you can pull it out and it'll sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells just as fresh as the day you put
it in.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good, good, good trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is very good trait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just really nice to smoke,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it wasn't the strongest strain,
but I would guesstimate because we never
[SPEAKER_04]: did tests back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would guess around eight, 17 to 20,
somewhere in there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: For percentage, uh, hitting 20 might be a
little hard, but yeah, in that,
[SPEAKER_04]: in that zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I actually, I'm bringing that one
back because I lost that original cut as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I supposedly still out there,
but I had lots of F5 and F6, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: crosses that I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the last few years I've been doing
selecting to get it back to close to the
[SPEAKER_04]: original.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now I have two different versions
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, uh, the one that's very similar to
the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have one that is similar to the
original, but a lot larger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's, what are they called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, well, just time warp and time warp XL.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, the XL should be on our website
in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the original will be ready just in
time for spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, hopefully by a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: By April we'll have the, the original time
warp back.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always wanted to try it, but I
noticed like whenever, whenever I was
[SPEAKER_05]: young and I was buying, um, like outdoor
strains, trying to grow them indoor,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was, it was actually harder to bring
outdoor strains indoor for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I would always heard them
unless, unless I started like keeping a
[SPEAKER_05]: clone of one and running it several
generations as it acclimates, it stops
[SPEAKER_05]: that, you know, but like, it took a while
to learn that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and the time we're cutting is
one of those strains that we never do get
[SPEAKER_04]: in indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very stringy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The branches could not hold up the buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it was, it's meant for,
it was bred outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's meant indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just did not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not impressive at all indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants just don't translate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's really weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know not so has a lot of experience with
that too, you know, indoor to outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I definitely have seen a lot of
very stable stuff outside that panics and
[SPEAKER_00]: herms when you bring it inside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've done a bunch of experimenting and
side-by-sides because I've grown a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same strains for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think that plants use different
spectrums of light for different
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put them outside in the sun,
they just get like the whole cornucopia of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything they could want from light is
right there for them to pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the spectral charts of
any kind of lamp, you might use indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very, very narrow compared to the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tend to believe that there's
certain things that like the sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, you know, and, and you just
don't get, unless you blend a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of lights in the same
indoor, um, you just don't, you just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really hard to approximate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some plants are super sensitive to
light, uh, and, you know, and UV and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that different types of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't say it for certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I have plants that are
very old now and I think sometimes they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very finicky inside and I can struggle
with them a little bit, but if I put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in a greenhouse, they're a champ every
time without fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the time works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just attribute that to like,
you know, the sun is the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's interesting in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about pine berries?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pine berry, um, very nice strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I had much, um, it was, it was a very
popular strain outdoors in Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bet a lot of that got sold down
south as beasters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm sure, but it was the beautiful
little like golf, golf ball size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buds, uh, and just prolific, easy to trim,
very, very branchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it would usually finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always harvest the planting stages when
we get fields of it outdoors, you'd go,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, probably the first or probably the
second week of September, you'd go cut all
[SPEAKER_04]: the tops, the top foot, top colas,
and then you'd wait another two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the bottoms would just fill in
and get big.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do that almost three harvests
off the same plant and just work your way
[SPEAKER_04]: down as, as it thickened up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it was another one that was very mold
resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could put it in the rain and it can
take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I know a lot of guys sold it as
indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked so nice in a bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: People would pass it off as indoors when
you go, that's obviously outdoor or
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse, but you know, a lot of the
part of the public didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nice enough to fly under the
radar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially the first, second and
third cut thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for even my area outdoor growers and
stuff that had limited dry space,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you could cut in waves and
you could fill your drying room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time you were empty,
you could take another round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time you've emptied it,
you could take the third round.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very beneficial, um, because
space was a premium and you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could much easier grow more than you
could process most, most, most farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely for us too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, the whole month of September
and halfway into October was basically a
[SPEAKER_04]: month and a half of harvest every two
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd go up to the bush, you harvest what
you can, you watch for any problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's still sunny out, you leave
what you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was every second day you do
the truck drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it was a lot of that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hang up the pine berry and then get
down for a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dry enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to fill up the room and then we
just pack it away in a room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed those old days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do too.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest with you, my old days are
different than your old days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously I'm like the generation under,
but even then still like the, for
[SPEAKER_05]: Californians, like the hay day of prop two
15 was, was like, you know, we had a
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty good, I think better than we had it
for a long time for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the reason why indoor is king is
you were able to grow indoor in more
[SPEAKER_00]: places than you were able to grow outdoor
both from like a Place where outdoor was
[SPEAKER_00]: you know would do well and you could get
away with it and and not get in big
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble You know indoor you could have a
garage or a bedroom or a warehouse and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was safe from prying eyes Outdoor you kind
of had to be somewhere semi permissible or
[SPEAKER_00]: at least where the cat-and-mouse game
could get played.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you know about the Ortega clone
they went around Canada anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wasn't sure that that's just one
of those ones that I hear about There's an
[SPEAKER_05]: Iranian that went around in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think That's more in Eastern Canada Just
like the m39 those trades more of a Quebec
[SPEAKER_04]: thing gotcha I've never worked with that
one Reefer man would be the professional
[SPEAKER_04]: on that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah You did a lot of work with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've never Okay, my next list goes on
into the Next-generation era, would you
[SPEAKER_05]: say it's the most important era for your
your work and the stuff you're most proud
[SPEAKER_05]: of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes Federation was just my first year
and a half in the business So yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's even to this day I have a lot of
the old strains that picked up I still
[SPEAKER_04]: stick with about one of my old strains and
keep trying to protect them instead of
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing on everything new Yes,
that the popular strain Of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I admire that unless it really impresses
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really interested In the American
market today People that do that are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably like 2% Yeah, like 98% is
probably one-off hybrids that they make
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they sell and then they move on
and Each drop that they do is a unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Breeding or reversals or whatever
the first time working with any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: moms Yeah, and it's very rare to have
people that just like these are my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I like These are the traits
I'm looking for and I'm gonna keep working
[SPEAKER_04]: these lines towards what I enjoy Yeah,
that's exactly how I do a lot of my
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties Once I know what I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to stabilize certain
traits With a lot of the varieties so
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, and I a lot of people keep offering
me and I do obviously do Do some one-off
[SPEAKER_04]: with phones and cutting some other
varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now I have a really nice Larry OG
I've got some death baba and a few other
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that I just bring into it and do
make some one-off crosses But they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not the strains like I treat like
my children the other there's part of my
[SPEAKER_04]: catalog You know been a part of my life
for 25 years So I can tell you exactly how
[SPEAKER_04]: they do in different climates and what to
feed them what not to feed them Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know more stuff about the genetics and
what happened on back in the old days in
[SPEAKER_04]: the late 90s to 2000s because I left
Canada in 2008 Okay, and I moved back only
[SPEAKER_04]: in 2017 Almost a 10 year gap where I don't
really I kind of out of touch with What
[SPEAKER_04]: happened during that 10 years sure when I
came back here five years ago I kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: just get set up my warehouse and I started
doing my own my own varieties again and I
[SPEAKER_04]: Mix less with what's going on in the local
community than I used to Where did you go
[SPEAKER_05]: during those years and were you still
breeding and selling seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, I was breeding in Spain I was
making seeds in Spain For six months that
[SPEAKER_04]: was too expensive to live there so I moved
down to Spain and Yeah, I had a few
[SPEAKER_04]: different breeding operations down there
and I produced a lot of seeds for a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: Moroccan farmers and actually for farmers
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of a lot of the Dutch guys
They would farm out their seed making to a
[SPEAKER_04]: Spanish first
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a bunch of the big seed producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all personal friends of mine that
produce for sweet seeds pyramid seeds The
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch Dutch growers to it was too
expensive to grow so they would just come
[SPEAKER_04]: meet a Spanish guy or somebody like me
living in Spain and They bring us they
[SPEAKER_04]: bring us the cones and say okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll buy them off you for a bucket seed
Just make them for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of Dutch companies don't make
their own stuff anymore Oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's been going on for a long time too
since what you did 2000 really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean I believe in 99 or 2000 they
changed the law in Amsterdam There was a
[SPEAKER_00]: loophole or in in the Netherlands I should
say where you could grow legally cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and they couldn't mess with you and
I think They closed that loophole and then
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of the famous seed companies got
raided or busted or whatever And I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that was one of the big reasons that the
exit has happened And it also secretly
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be when they started Farming out
the actual seed production to third
[SPEAKER_00]: parties and not doing it in-house anymore
But just not mentioning that it was all
[SPEAKER_04]: third parties producing their seed Yeah,
and a lot of the Dutch guys, you know if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're living in Holland Wouldn't you
rather live in Spain where it's nice and
[SPEAKER_04]: sunny?
[SPEAKER_04]: All year round so a lot of them retired to
to Spain so a lot of them did bring their
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics down there and they have their
network of friends and growers Seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain and Switzerland First reader reader
Steve went to Switzerland Shauncey went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland some other people went Swiss
for a bit Yeah, all that and then some
[SPEAKER_00]: people went to Spain and vice versa and
that kind of Became like the new places in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe One thing just is totally random,
but I don't want to lose it before before
[SPEAKER_00]: we do is that Maybe you could talk for a
second when you were in Spain about like
[SPEAKER_00]: how much Moroccan do you think is still?
[SPEAKER_00]: actual land race Moroccan and how much is
Imported Spanish work grown in Morocco So
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, actually I know quite a bit about
that because I went to Morocco several
[SPEAKER_04]: times quite a few times With a lot of big
I had some Spanish friends that were big
[SPEAKER_04]: hash smugglers and some of them Had go
shops and they were seed breeders in
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would go supply Spain or supply Morocco
with seeds But what the first time I went
[SPEAKER_04]: there to meet some of the farmers in the
mountains I went there looking for that
[SPEAKER_04]: old-school Moroccan sure the real brown
But by the time I went there it would have
[SPEAKER_04]: been around 2009 2010 they had are at that
period they had already switched over to
[SPEAKER_04]: mostly Pakistani genetics Interesting
there were very few farmers that were
[SPEAKER_04]: still doing the old-school Moroccan
strains that had that nice dusty flavor
[SPEAKER_04]: More like the kind of more resembled a lot
of the Lebanese stuff actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think about it and a lot redder
hash, but the Pakistanis would yield
[SPEAKER_04]: double or triple and But they at that
point they still weren't cutting the mails
[SPEAKER_04]: that they were just starting to learn to
go out to the miles and And if you did if
[SPEAKER_04]: you were a grower who get it cut all your
mails Well, your neighbors mail pollen
[SPEAKER_04]: still gonna float in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but but even with a bit of that
floating in you're gonna It's gonna be
[SPEAKER_05]: substantially less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, when we went started going down
there to Morocco a lot of the big guys
[SPEAKER_04]: that were the big sellers in the region
for the local hash farmers We're starting
[SPEAKER_04]: to clue in that if we started bringing
buying the Spanish feminized seeds They
[SPEAKER_04]: would up their yields they wouldn't have
all these males and they would get a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: more hash so they started recording a lot
of from Spain a lot of the super silver
[SPEAKER_04]: haze and critical sure plus so So many of
the farmers there started switching to
[SPEAKER_04]: buying feminized seeds and one of the Us
farmers in Spain and we had extra seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew that every year The Moroccan
buyers would be up in Spain and they would
[SPEAKER_04]: buy seeds by the million Yeah,
and then they would distribute it to their
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers stuff the quality and yields So
yeah, they switched.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say with the last five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mostly a Spanish Varieties,
which is based on that stuff a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: critical and I've actually been in quite a
bit of contact lately the last two years
[SPEAKER_04]: with a big rock and Guy down there and
they're really looking to develop strains
[SPEAKER_04]: now that are more drought resistant A lot
of the varieties from Spain were not well
[SPEAKER_04]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use so much more water Yeah,
and a lot of the farmers there now are
[SPEAKER_04]: putting in drip lines Even back when I was
there the farm that we went to they
[SPEAKER_04]: already had my Spanish friend who?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was the buyer of all their hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought down it two vans full of drip
lines to this farm for these guys But
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, they're really the guy that I'm
talking to now He's on the other side of
[SPEAKER_04]: the mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not up in the mountains in Katamah He
down in a research place of 10 acres and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're trying to develop the drought
resistance Varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow I've been talking to him about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's asking me which varieties of mine are
the most drought resistant So they're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be working with some of my varieties
doing some selective breeding It makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense they go from very drought resistant
varieties that probably were low lower
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding because they're because they
Could survive in an arid climate and they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't really getting as much inputs as
they needed but they would live to these
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger yielding Dutch things that drought
resistance isn't a problem when you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland indoor and you're just getting fed
with Rockwell all the time so they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for that and so they get these
bigger yielding plants, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: thirsty and Then they realize they don't
have enough water You know I never did
[SPEAKER_04]: find find any of the original Moroccan I
had the Guys that I knew there I'd asked
[SPEAKER_04]: them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any farmers still growing this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Original variety and I had them looking
for me because I wanted to get my hands on
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed What's a shame about that is you
would think that the critical plus you
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about and the super silver
haze and some of that Those obviously like
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that original Moroccan would be
prime breeding candidates To try to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: into those lines and to find ones that are
drought resistant and acclimated but yield
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's definitely right that'd be
the way to do it Yeah, too bad You know I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't mention it but like when you were
talking about reefermen being down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica Jamaica has a similar thing and
that most of the original Jamaican lines
[SPEAKER_00]: are basically it seems like almost
completely gone and They've been replaced
[SPEAKER_00]: by Dutch genetics That were shorter and
faster and bigger yielding and easier and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe better names for them And so it's
it's you know, it's the way nature works
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, but you know, a lot of these
land races have been displaced Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's one thing that I know reefer man is
doing right now in Jamaica With the part
[SPEAKER_04]: of land that he's working on he's trying
to bring back a lot of those old varieties
[SPEAKER_04]: He has pretty extensive collection and I
know he's been working on bringing back
[SPEAKER_04]: the old Jamaican lands breath with
Rastafarian collective there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe he's working with Trying to
bring back the old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone can do it he can do it I've
often thought too that like some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: places like in Afghanistan and Pakistan
that have so many of their original
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties It's probably because it's been
at war for 25 years and it's been pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous for Westerners Especially,
you know white Christians or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that to go into those hills And so as
a result of that, they really haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten super silver haze or critical Mass
or this or that or Dutch hybrids because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not easy to go there You know,
yeah, that's not it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, definitely a little more
secluded those genetics haven't been
[SPEAKER_04]: polluted yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Maybe someday off to grow a grow a
beard and go there.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right Yeah, I know I'll grow a beard
and go incognito So, let's talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: let's see Diablo, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a real popular next-generation one
that I remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was very popular That's another
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lost but that was basically my Avalon
crossed with that early sativa as well
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool Yeah, I know there's a lot of
growers in the Midwest in Minnesota
[SPEAKER_04]: Michigan, you know across Nebraska Back in
those days.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just loved and raved about the Diablo
It was one of those strains when it was in
[SPEAKER_04]: veg it grew like a sativa extremely fast,
but the second it tripped into flower It
[SPEAKER_04]: would flower fast Whether it was indoors
or outdoors indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about a six flowering period,
but it didn't give the quality quality
[SPEAKER_04]: buds indoors Outdoors it was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So In a shorter climate you can you can
veg it you can get a large-sized plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: when it flipped it flipped hard and fast
That was one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was very nice trade Our buddy
rings that was his favorite He has a bunch
[SPEAKER_05]: of pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just mass just like 14 foot plants out in
Mendo Your Afghani Kush Which hash plant
[SPEAKER_05]: did you use in that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani Kush there was an Afghani hash
plant In BC back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the first ones that I used
to breed my Avalon strain
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay Grapefruit haze we talked about this
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was going around San Diego for a while
That's like they said that the original
[SPEAKER_04]: grapefruit the sweet pink grapefruit
micado dynamite whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_04]: it Yeah, we're saying the Flying Dutchman
Skunk one by haze I've been working with
[SPEAKER_04]: that ever ever since it's now basically is
an inbred line But it was the very it was
[SPEAKER_04]: the first first variety that I turned into
a into an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Wow Doing that as an auto flower very
very long time now since I've been in
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain about ten years and it's the one
that has Great mold resistance everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: that grows it here in Canada has When it's
side by side with another auto flower,
[SPEAKER_04]: it may not be as Large a plant,
but it is stinky and it's no mold Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: very very resistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So What did you use to?
[SPEAKER_05]: To to make your plants auto flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was your auto flower input?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the very first Ruderalis cross I
used was a ruderalis big bud Okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was going around from a grower friend
in Spain who worked a few other seed
[SPEAKER_04]: companies And that's what I did my first
that cross with and it was already It was
[SPEAKER_04]: already a semi stabilized Ruderalis big
bud was already being sold as an auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flower so that's what I used as my first
back cross and Then yeah, once I had four
[SPEAKER_04]: back crosses into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was it was stable It was more
more stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm a few generations into it now I
did a lot of what more selecting since
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been back in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've done very little auto flower
work, but I did some with Ernesto from
[SPEAKER_05]: buddha seeds Spain Okay, his white dwarf
they were they were dwarf Autos auto
[SPEAKER_05]: dwarfs, I think you called them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they were tiny I Had a good friend
in Spain that made a bunch of the red
[SPEAKER_04]: dwarfs white drawers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah It couldn't even be my buddy's girl
that they came from yeah Ernesto,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he owns Like most people over
there they buy their seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, this is a little off-topic
but maybe not when Since you decided to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and move to Europe for 10 years Was it
personal reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it whether was it like you felt like
it was a business opportunity over there
[SPEAKER_00]: for seed making?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a combo?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a combo of reasons I've always
wanted to travel Europe and and you want
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the day if you wanted to reach the
big leagues in that seed business Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: so and that mixed with The week that I
moved there was also the week Mark Emory
[SPEAKER_04]: got sentenced to five years in prison for
selling seeds And I was I was to say they
[SPEAKER_04]: were looking at me pretty heavy I Just
felt it was time to go and leave for a
[SPEAKER_04]: while before I end up in the can as well I
was more in the background when I was one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the largest seed producers that that he
had Yeah, so I figured well, it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect time to leave Better get out while
you're ahead Yeah, so that's what I did
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you enjoy living there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I still consider I almost consider Spain
my home Living there for nine years When I
[SPEAKER_00]: travel to Spain, it feels like I'm going
home Did you did you speak Spanish before
[SPEAKER_00]: you moved there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you learn while you were there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned a fair amount of Spanish when I
was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah It's pretty fluid now Is it fairly
affordable compared to like California
[SPEAKER_05]: that you know, very affordable?
[SPEAKER_04]: Spain Spain if you're living in the north
of Europe, it's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Hall and I believe in Canadian or
American dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably paid but 2500 for a small
apartment with a little grass in the back
[SPEAKER_04]: in Amsterdam So when I got offered the
opportunity to move to Spain my rent went
[SPEAKER_04]: down to about $400 and And I had a
three-story 14-room hotel that I lived in
[SPEAKER_04]: for $450 so And cost of living it's next
enough in Spain Yeah, so yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's sunny food is cheap and great Nice
and polite there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the culture is pretty polite from
what I'm used to I mean the Culture one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I think is cool about the
culture especially for people that do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of indoor gardening like we all do is
They stay up late You know it gets it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: hot there and so it's very common You
know, you'll have you'll have playgrounds
[SPEAKER_00]: full of kids at 10 o'clock at night
because that's when it cools down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's normal You know eating it eating at
945 at night cuz that's when it's cooled
[SPEAKER_00]: down and you start cooking, you know It
gets very hot Like I was always being in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada when I lived in the cities I do my
watering usually at night I go out to
[SPEAKER_04]: start working in the girl room at 10 p.m
Because you knew the neighbors weren't
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna come over things like that So you go
up to the girl room at 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: You work till two or three in the morning
And that was kind of my cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I moved to Spain it fitted perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So I was just thinking I was like man
it really is well suited for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners because it's got that late night
lifestyle like Matt you trip out you can
[SPEAKER_00]: literally be at a playground at 11 o'clock
at night and it is full of Screaming
[SPEAKER_00]: eight-year-olds and running around parents
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The swings are full people are like it's
so weird like Yeah, they just Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of the elderly people don't go out
during the day because it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not it makes sense At 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see all the old ladies on the
street with their canes walk it up and
[SPEAKER_04]: down the street till 2 in the morning
That's awesome during the summer months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very I enjoyed living there and I'm
still considering retiring there On a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal note my dad wanted to move the
family to Spain and like the 90s Because
[SPEAKER_00]: he had a bunch of work in Europe and it
was so much closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom would never Do it because she
didn't want to learn another language But
[SPEAKER_00]: he was basically like if we would have
moved there then with the exchange rate
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was and how cheap real estate was
he's like I probably would have retired 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years before I did Just because of the way
it all worked out Yeah, it was so
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's changed a little bit,
but it used to be incredibly cheap It
[SPEAKER_04]: still is compared to Canada and the US
it's still very cheap very very cheap
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, same in California, it's crazy now
it is crazy like where I live in
[SPEAKER_05]: California Bakersfield it used to be like
one of the last little bastions of
[SPEAKER_05]: affordable living in California You know
where you could get a house for two
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred and fifty thousand dollars You
can't get a tiny house now like a 1200
[SPEAKER_05]: square foot house for less than half a
million.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Yeah for 250,000 in Spain you have a
beautiful house with a swimming pool and a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice view Yeah, I mean Matt doesn't even
live in a night Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean he technically lives in California,
but like It's not a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Because when people think of
California they think coastal and
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains live in hell he just lives in in
boiling hot desert dry It is still an
[SPEAKER_05]: affordable now, yeah, it's crazy So what
what are some of the ones you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: cover the most from next generation that
our current stock that you want people to
[SPEAKER_04]: know about the most Well, we brought our
Romulan back feminized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's uh, yeah, it's as close as I
can get to the original except it produces
[SPEAKER_04]: better than the original Produces much
better than the original.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big good trait for Yeah,
yeah, I can't say it's not quite as piney
[SPEAKER_04]: as yes the old one was but it's it's
pretty damn close so Is that the dominant
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene profile for Romulan was pine?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, very pine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, piney Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely the dominant one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely so So yeah, I don't know if
you've seen my catalog or proves the
[SPEAKER_04]: website a little bit But I've got a few
new varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bringing back an old columbian red
mexican variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh The seeds are just fattening up right
now Testers Around the 12 12 weeks So
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome and a lot of people that scares
off but not me Yeah, even if it was
[SPEAKER_05]: longer, I'd rather have a nice pure
trustworthy Colombian red line or
[SPEAKER_05]: something then worry about how long it
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also got a tester room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I last year I made a bunch of I crossed my
Romulan with a few Malawi gold land race.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh nice And also with the puroho Colombian
And also with the Acapulco gold So I've
[SPEAKER_04]: got a nice room right now with about five
weeks into flower right now and doing a
[SPEAKER_04]: big grow out and testing them out But the
malawis the first round they were So wild
[SPEAKER_04]: and so sativa and I didn't find I wasn't
quite Very impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did a few crosses anyway with a few
of the nicest tracks and The Romulan cross
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've done with it are just coming
along phenomenally right now And it's so
[SPEAKER_04]: much and made it growable indoors because
they were just they were so lanky In the
[SPEAKER_04]: first round that I did so yeah if I do
release that that's that's probably still
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be a year or two away Before I
release that that's what I'm working on
[SPEAKER_04]: writing my private stuff right now That's
really cool stuff though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Malawi can be really resinous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always have a story like I learned that
some like sativas will not flower under
[SPEAKER_05]: like normal 12 hours a light with Malawi
that was the plant that I learned that
[SPEAKER_05]: with after three months of keeping it
under 1212 and zero Sex trait showing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but if you don't experiment with
those you don't find the good ones either
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's very true Yeah, I never seen
anything like that for Yeah, I noticed
[SPEAKER_04]: that with the convalesce it wouldn't
flower it would take so long Was it from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because one of the things that I
learned You know with some of the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that had run like a bunch of the Neville's
Hayes and some of like the that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: work in Holland Was they told me like if
you take an old clone and you flower It
[SPEAKER_00]: it's ready to flower because it's been
alive for long enough that it knows it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be blooming, but it hasn't And they
said if you get some of these equatorial
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas going They're very used to like
from seed knowing that they need to veg
[SPEAKER_00]: for six or seven months Before they even
want to think about flow So they said it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very difficult to get an extreme
sativa like that to trigger early Because
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically it just doesn't want to you
know, like you Can force that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: force the matter with light cycle,
but it's harder because it wants to much
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a pre puberty,
you know human or something like until it
[SPEAKER_00]: hits that phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not ready So the opposite of
autoflower Yeah, the opposite of
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflower like and it makes sense right
like you have a situation in which it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always 11 13 or 12 12 or something like
that near the equator like a Malawi or a
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian or a Panamanian or maybe
something like that and They're just used
[SPEAKER_00]: to growing for you know, maybe even six
seven months eight months before they
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom and then they bloom for five Some of
them take longer than a year from seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish because there is no winter That
they're terrified of dying under they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't it doesn't get cold enough to die
That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you want to grow those indoors
It's best to keep them root bound in a
[SPEAKER_04]: small container in the corner of the room
for six months before I brought home some
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze and I think it was 98 or 99
right around then the first year or two it
[SPEAKER_00]: was released and I was planning on making
all this seed and I set up this room and I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't even get the the males to drop
pollen You know for a month I had a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room that was just ended up being
headstashed because it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know 20 different plants That I was
thinking was gonna make seed and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: no pollen to make seed and I had to
restart it and put more plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: with the same males and wait some more and
I did but I that was in then I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: the tricks of the light cycle to me when
you bloomed everything was 1212 that was
[SPEAKER_00]: what the book said that was what you did I
never heard of 1113 or 1014 or any weird
[SPEAKER_00]: times like that It was like, you know at
the time the level of knowledge I had it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like 1212 is what you do So,
you know learning What were some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: books that got you into growing like when
you first started learning to grow were
[SPEAKER_04]: there books involved or just people I was
fortunate enough to Get plopped down in
[SPEAKER_04]: Vancouver where I Learned from other
growers more than books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah And when when Horace or bates was
making his first books or maybe not the
[SPEAKER_04]: first books that I knew of any Way,
yeah, he was he was up in Canada Taking
[SPEAKER_04]: photos in my grow rooms half.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so funny Some of the first books
that I seen were books that I was in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah so Hands-on hands-on learning for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome Yeah, that's that's really
really interesting not many people can say
[SPEAKER_05]: that Their first place that they were
seeing had their grow room in it So you
[SPEAKER_05]: have your your blueberry punch,
which is which are Romulan blueberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Very Romulan male, which which blue line
are you using?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one that I The one I'm using now My
first I was a DJ short blueberry from the
[SPEAKER_04]: late 90s and I crossed that with the
grapefruit male that I was using And then
[SPEAKER_04]: back crossed that was an f4 basically f4
blueberry that cross that I'm using My
[SPEAKER_04]: Romulan male and that's basically the one
I'm using I'm actually doing a female hunt
[SPEAKER_04]: of that generation right now I've got 40
females going right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for a new fresh blueberry
tears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I Always so I have my main grow room
where I make my seeds and then I have my
[SPEAKER_04]: five light grow room or I'm just
Constantly just testing just growing out
[SPEAKER_04]: things Yeah Yeah, I'm a blueberry fiend
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand the hunt for the perfect
blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of my favorite things in life
Yeah, I was a lot different than what you
[SPEAKER_04]: see is blueberry on the market these days
We used to have so different and way
[SPEAKER_04]: different than the Dutch passion blueberry
is nothing like the blueberry from back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day Yeah, you know when that's passion
one is a lot easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looks a lot better nicer in a bag
Easy to trim but it has no smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that old fruity smell that the
old blueberry had That's don't seem to
[SPEAKER_04]: care about I noticed that a lot about some
Dutch strains because they all mix their
[SPEAKER_04]: weed with tobacco So for them the flavor
isn't as important.
[SPEAKER_04]: They the Dutch breed bred for a healthy
girl structure It weren't as concerned
[SPEAKER_05]: about the smell That makes a lot of sense
with the fact that they were mixing it
[SPEAKER_05]: with tobacco that they wouldn't have paid
as much attention to that I used to battle
[SPEAKER_00]: with them about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I bet me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do I would go over there and they
would think I was nuts for smoking pure
[SPEAKER_00]: flour and not mixing it with a bunch of
tobacco, you know, we're like the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common thing they would they would do is
they would make a has she snake that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would a thin a thin, you know roll of hash
and then they would roll tobacco around
[SPEAKER_00]: that and make a big spliff and start
chafing that and so Yeah, the first couple
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cups In Amsterdam that I went to
I went with a few other Canadians in
[SPEAKER_04]: Vancouver Feedback my friends there and a
few other readers and they would make fun
[SPEAKER_04]: of us Canadians Because we would smoke
pure joints and they're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: these are the hardcore drug addicts.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're smoking I don't actually smoke
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found it very difficult like
especially in winter when Amsterdam is
[SPEAKER_00]: very cold and and kind of grimy To be in a
coffee shop with like eight or nine
[SPEAKER_00]: spliffs going And the amount of smoke and
the amount of tobacco smoke and just me
[SPEAKER_00]: just wishing like like these places need a
huge carbon filter Because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was actually kind of intense like it's
more tobacco than weed you prissy American
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought they thought it was they
thought we were nuts for sure as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoking pure cannabis, you know,
but Yeah, it's I Am I met and I argue
[SPEAKER_00]: about this, but I almost think that like
DJ shorts blue work is so inbred That it
[SPEAKER_00]: works best in out process.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that like it's really hard I've
grown a lot of his work trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: like amazing examples of each line and
it's really hard to do for me to find like
[SPEAKER_00]: the grail that like looks good and tastes
good and has like potency to it And isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: a leafy monster But it seems to shine when
you throw it on things that aren't it
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I I think and I'm gonna stick by it
till the day I die now and it wasn't from
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that I did it was it was it was
growing someone else's blueberry work like
[SPEAKER_05]: And I at the time when when this guy Blown
star from Texas resin company when he
[SPEAKER_05]: released his blueberry work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had released my first blueberry work So
I had no interest in growing his because I
[SPEAKER_05]: already had the best You know,
it's like I got the best minority smells
[SPEAKER_05]: like blueberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: What it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much better could it be?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well mine was lacking resin production and
it was it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very purple It looked more like
Oregon purple tie type more loose buds not
[SPEAKER_05]: dense Low resin production and just no
recreational potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a lot of medical potency where it
were nerve pain and stuff It would dull it
[SPEAKER_05]: was great for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But recreational people would just be
like, what is this garbage?
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't getting me high, you know,
but I thought I had the best one and then
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost it And I had to go through a bunch
of blueberries and the first place I
[SPEAKER_05]: started looking was Canadian blueberries
because in my experience Canadians that
[SPEAKER_05]: was that era where people were starting to
capture that super blueberry actual
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry smell actual blueberry taste was
in the Canadian blue line So that's where
[SPEAKER_05]: I started and I ended up going to this guy
lone stars work Who I'm not sure which
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry line he used but it seems like
at some point near the end he outcrossed
[SPEAKER_05]: to some sort of Afghani let let those The
blue breed true the blue turps and blue
[SPEAKER_05]: flavors all that breed true But it doesn't
breed like an inbred plant because of that
[SPEAKER_05]: because of that one single back cross I
can cross it to like his line to a blue
[SPEAKER_05]: velvet and not have too much inbreeding
that all you get is the mutations and the
[SPEAKER_05]: You know foxtail look with no resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm pretty staunch on the
blueberry need an outcross at some point
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, I pretty much noticed the same
thing the ones I've seen and it's yeah and
[SPEAKER_04]: the blueberries from back in the late 90s
early 2000s in Vancouver there in British
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia There was a lot of them and they
were very similar in some ways to the
[SPEAKER_04]: grapefruit Yeah, there is great food.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some similarities But if you
draw on a batch of blueberry seeds Some of
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ shorts crosses with the blueberries
where I
[SPEAKER_00]: Think when he started selling his seeds
first He started at Sag Martha with Tony
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he ended up at Dutch Passion But
he didn't really control that too much I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it was more like he sent him a bunch
of seed and they made their own selections
[SPEAKER_00]: and Then when he's when it started getting
sold in Canada It's almost I think he kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of took control of it again and was
sending seed up there I had no idea what
[SPEAKER_05]: was going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did DJ go it was available It was
available in Canada before Dutch Passion
[SPEAKER_04]: or anyone in Europe had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah So he was selling first through
Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Know what there was there was clones of
it going around when I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, I mean Oregon his but where he's
from isn't very far from from you know
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he'd make regular trips to Canada
and I believe he did some work with Spice
[SPEAKER_04]: of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Steve Yes, even ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of Steve's original sister
Barry That's just very had some of DJ
[SPEAKER_04]: shorts blueberry that came straight from
him That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I never really realized that that
the clones are going up before they were
[SPEAKER_05]: even released in Europe like the seed
lines are released in Europe the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: were going up and make it remember at the
time that Sag Martha and those groups were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it This is kind of pre the
Canadian seed selling at least to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public that was easy and well-known You
know, it really was only Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right like that like Canadian seed
selling happened a little bit later Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it actually pretty much wouldn't mark
first started and then Kyle was kind seed
[SPEAKER_04]: that would have been around 94 yeah,
I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sharing with Matt before we did this
I have like some we I have some like old
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultures and some different stuff
and we were like looking over like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Federation list in Mark's catalog and
different stuff, you know, and and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know DJ was in there He had his four
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like blue velvet blue
heaven blueberry and flow maybe something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that You know and Yeah in the early
years of Those things being advertised,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there was definitely people
selling his stuff So I dollar high dollar
[SPEAKER_04]: for that for the era super high dollar
insane high prices back then I Remember
[SPEAKER_05]: those prices
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you're really stoked about
that you you have good stock of you want
[SPEAKER_05]: to get out there
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice banner banner Grapefruit crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you know right now one of the other
more popular strains I have I know it's
[SPEAKER_04]: more popular in the south is truffles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Have a black truffles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've crossed with that Columbia red.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Wow, so And that will be on the website
probably in a few weeks The plants are
[SPEAKER_04]: getting due to get cut in about a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So So yeah, very I'm looking forward to
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already did some
[SPEAKER_04]: The Colombian truffles the Mexican sativa
with the Colombian reds coming up soon as
[SPEAKER_05]: well That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and the Romulan is still one of my
yeah, I'm so happy with the one that I
[SPEAKER_04]: have right now Yeah, finally released
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Yeah, I've got so many strange right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to wrap my head around anyone in
particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm stoked to see You bring Romulan
back to you know, like I said,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's there's been many cases of many
different companies none in particular
[SPEAKER_05]: that I'm referring to but many companies
coming out claiming that they have pure
[SPEAKER_05]: Romulan, you know or this Romulan hybrid
and you know, they're newer people and
[SPEAKER_05]: probably don't you know, and it's good to
see a Reputable person that you know has
[SPEAKER_05]: good provenance with this stuff that's
worked it for years that knows it bringing
[SPEAKER_05]: it back Bringing back with the real name
and everything There's a the Romulan here
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada There's just one going around on
the recreational market in all the stores
[SPEAKER_04]: that they sell as Romulan and actually was
Romulan Joe that first showed me a bag
[SPEAKER_04]: when I went to see him a few months ago
and We looked at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried some together and we were like
now this is a Romulan grapefruit cross
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's going around it's definitely
not the original and there's also pyramid
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds now in Spain they've released
Romulan but it's also but it's a Romulan
[SPEAKER_04]: cross that I had in Spain that my friend
of mine is making for them So I'm selling
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not the Romulan as well, but it's
it's got some Romulan genetics in it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know other than other growers that might
have the Something as close as me would be
[SPEAKER_04]: Vick I Yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome I'm gonna be doing a lot
more work in the future here in South
[SPEAKER_04]: America.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited Actually next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to Chile and to Argentina again
So I'm setting up a working with a few
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders down there with my genetics to
try it down in their climate And that's
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing in South America to especially
in Chile.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a lot of rain So there's a lot of
interest in our mold resistance strains
[SPEAKER_04]: down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome TV up teaming up with a few
breeders down there And so we'll see how
[SPEAKER_04]: it goes So I hope it goes well keep the
facility in Canada and operation but in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada with legalization there's Not much
money to be made here anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's really really difficult to make
a living and the people are just bombarded
[SPEAKER_04]: with story there's a store on every corner
and Unless you're a real Grower is really
[SPEAKER_04]: passionate about it people here don't buy
My steeds anymore and there's so many
[SPEAKER_04]: other beers that just flooded the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes I just don't see much of a future
myself for myself in Canada anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Probably start making the transition
Yeah, over the next the next few months or
[SPEAKER_04]: the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So It's only a matter of time in my
opinion for the u.s Is is just right
[SPEAKER_05]: behind you guys and the way that you're
seeing it I think is that is really a very
[SPEAKER_05]: realistic and smart direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really really believe that Are you gonna
be doing any land race hunting while
[SPEAKER_05]: you're down there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not well, I'm gonna be bringing some of
them my my Colombian and if you have those
[SPEAKER_04]: strains People down there to grow out and
test out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah But at first my first gonna get
established down there with my flagship
[SPEAKER_04]: strains like the Romulan Island sweets
dynamite the time warp My most popular
[SPEAKER_04]: strains gonna get established first before
I get to experimental down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right About the Romulan is as we are
as we're all getting older, you know A lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things for especially for new smokers
and stuff like that They hear things like
[SPEAKER_00]: nl5 or Romulan or this or that or whatever
and they're famous names that they know
[SPEAKER_00]: almost nothing else about and So Romulan
is definitely one that whether or not you
[SPEAKER_00]: have any access to the real Romulan or you
just have a hybrid or whatever The name is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get used because it's a catchy name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of cannabis history now and it
was prevalent enough in popular enough
[SPEAKER_00]: that young people they want to try the
best things of yesteryear and There's
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there that want to give them
what they want whether they have it or not
[SPEAKER_04]: You know Yeah with my Romulan when I moved
back to Canada My partner was like Jake
[SPEAKER_04]: just work on that Romulan because
everybody asked for it and I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: working for five years now before I Get a
release it because now I'm confident In
[SPEAKER_04]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to put my name behind it But we
three years we got asked to bring the
[SPEAKER_04]: Romulan back and I guess I'm working on
it, but I'm not gonna release it until
[SPEAKER_04]: Until I'm you know, I'm proud to put my
name behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah We're finally at that point now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking to your partner and he's
like, yeah, you know, I know a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was mostly on the back side.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to talk to Jay.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like I used to run a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've probably never heard of it It was
called kind and I was like, oh this one
[SPEAKER_05]: here's your catalogs I had it like a big
collection old catalogs read out of his
[SPEAKER_05]: old catalog to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was stoked He's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he ran the kind seed all the
shipping into the business from the UK for
[SPEAKER_04]: 17 years He lived there and he became
close personal friends with all the big
[SPEAKER_04]: Dutch breeders him and Ari and our good
friends And he just knows about shipping
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds anywhere in the world and he's a
super friendly guy at phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have to interview him sometime as
well because just the His side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: business is to me is just as important as
you know Even the breeding side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: business if there was a lot of history He
knows so much history and back stories
[SPEAKER_05]: about what went on behind the scenes who
got what when you know Who who got what
[SPEAKER_05]: batch of seeds when and know what behind
what strain probably, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as the Dutch scene goes he knows
that very very well Yeah better than the
[SPEAKER_04]: British Columbia scene because he was over
there during those days kind seed was one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the biggest seed sellers Yeah to
America in those days It's kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds men or attitude seeds are now Yeah
and seed back then so he had a good
[SPEAKER_04]: personal relationship with all the
breeders Yeah, he's one of the few people
[SPEAKER_04]: that I know has been in
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, man, we have so much more I could go
over like I have a list of massive list of
[SPEAKER_05]: strains and everything we can go over I'd
love to pick your brain some more.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're Hitting right around two hours now
So I was gonna wrap it up because you've
[SPEAKER_05]: taken a lot of your time But I just wanted
to thank you for coming on and speaking
[SPEAKER_05]: with us about all these strains I
appreciate you also for keeping track of
[SPEAKER_05]: your work like from a breeder perspective
I respect that a lot like you you're able
[SPEAKER_05]: to speak your lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know your lines You remember the males
you you know all that that's that's not a
[SPEAKER_04]: common thing and I highly respond That's
something that's something you can't fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's stuck in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Remember I could think back 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smell a plant Oh smells like something I
do 22 years ago and it was in this town
[SPEAKER_04]: under this light and it was May
[SPEAKER_00]: Memories I feel that I mean Matt and I we
talk a lot about There's certain people
[SPEAKER_00]: that you talk to and they're extremely
vague About some of the stuff that they do
[SPEAKER_00]: and for me being like a you know Weed nerd
or something like that since it's like so
[SPEAKER_00]: much of my life Like someone wants to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said I can be like, oh,
yeah It was like I did this and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like that this happened and I
remember I was and you were wearing that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just Part of it, you know,
you can talk confidently about stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: because you spend every day with it People
won't realize that growing and breeding is
[SPEAKER_00]: day in day out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have success Yeah,
and you have to stack those days together
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long period of time to get to where
you want to go Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't travel you move
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be an absolute pleasure man
anytime anytime So yeah, thank you so
[SPEAKER_05]: much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you have a wonderful evening and
we'll talk to you soon
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like I was connected with
everything around me All of a sudden I
[SPEAKER_03]: just started questioning everything I'd
ever been told You know by the time I got
[SPEAKER_03]: high that very first time When it started
to hit me I'm like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I Got high You You
