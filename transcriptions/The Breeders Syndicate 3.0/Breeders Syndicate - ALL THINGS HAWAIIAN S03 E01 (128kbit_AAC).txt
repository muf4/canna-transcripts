[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sick tonight, so I probably won't
be talking a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll be doing most of the
talking like usual.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, our Riot Seedco account got
blocked from going live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that out the second I tried to
go live.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking weird, but I do get
reported a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it on this platform and it may be
a smaller show, but I don't really give a
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the people who want to be here will
be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if y'all look back there, look at that
beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a tender telecaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?
Hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so old fucking Instagram blocked me
because someone's been reporting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonder who?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it could be any one of my loyal
adoring fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely got the potential for
abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, if you want to tell history,
you're going to be pissing people off no
[SPEAKER_02]: matter what you do, no matter what you're
talking about, no matter which subject it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, because there's always someone making
money off the subject, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, there's people that are making,
there's people that like, what is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more mystery, less history?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like relationship advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it comes into play with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking like even in UFOs,
dude, people go fucking nuts on each other
[SPEAKER_02]: when they don't necessarily believe the
same exact, you know, thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they report each other and they get
real nasty and like dox each other and
[SPEAKER_02]: swat each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody likes science until it
challenges their assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and it's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That science is going to back you up on
everything that you believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have 80 people in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like this account being much
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's looks like it's popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's only been a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully more people pop on and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess if we're interesting enough,
we'll have a podcast on it or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you wanted to touch on
early on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, we kind of like we were kind
of going to have a grab bag of things to
[SPEAKER_00]: chat about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to talk a little bit since
it kind of ties into what you and CSI have
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to kind of touch on a little
bit of Hawaiian history and what Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: means in general in terms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and then we were going to
then there was something that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: irritated both of us about terpenes and
some other stuff that we were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I printed this out, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we can, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, so not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe what we can do, we've got 91
people in climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we can do is we'll we'll keep off
the the semi-controversial stuff for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll start on we'll start on the on
Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean to be Hawaiian?
[SPEAKER_00]: So so Hawaiian is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii is a trippy place because I believe
it's the farthest islands from a continent
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of one of the seven continents,
it's the farthest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the farthest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are no there's not much on
Hawaii that's native.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things are non-native to Hawaii
because it's essentially a volcanic island
[SPEAKER_00]: chain in the middle of nowhere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the interesting things about
Hawaii, Hawaii is that Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, is the only American state
that's actually in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that would make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like even even if you go down to,
like, say Florida, like the very southern
[SPEAKER_00]: tip of Florida or the Florida Keys,
for instance, those are still considered
[SPEAKER_00]: the subtropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about what about Guam?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Guam isn't a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will admit that I'm not familiar
with all of America's territories and
[SPEAKER_00]: where they may or may not be located.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only know that Guam people are called
Chamorrin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's I learned that because I had a
friend that was from Guam and I said he
[SPEAKER_02]: was Guamanian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got real pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I'll say this, like from the
perspective that we're speaking of,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing something in the United
States, in the 50 United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't go through customs the same way
as if you're outside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we've got this, you know,
I don't have it, but they're doing some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Hawaiian lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a pretty old strain from
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought we'd chat about what
that meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no we unlike most of what we
talk about where Mexican or Colombian or
[SPEAKER_00]: Panamanian or Thai or African or any of
those shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is no record of marijuana in
Hawaii much before, you know, the 60s or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's not like there wasn't
really any indigenous cultures cultivating
it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's an aspect where,
you know, it's rumored and they certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: were involved that the Brotherhood of
Eternal Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the locations that they
used to grow cannabis before helicopters
[SPEAKER_00]: flew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, a lot of the
common strains back then, Mexican,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian, that kind of thing could be
grown successfully out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even today in Hawaii, most people,
if they want to grow in Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_00]: they veg indoors or in greenhouses with
artificial lighting, because it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically so close to 1212 there all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That anything that we normally grow in our
in our stuff, unless it's some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: pure equatorial sativa, would flower
immediately upon going outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's it's, you know,
I mean, that's part of the reason why
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorials take so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is they don't have any like wintertime
pressure where they have to create seed
[SPEAKER_00]: before they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always kind of warm and nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not, you know, you take
Afghanistan or Hindu Kush or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, where there's a pretty good
amount of difference between daytime and
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime versus summer and winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the equatorial regions,
there's not a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might be 1212 or you might be
13 and 11 or you might be 11 and 13,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't really bury much beyond that
little aspect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hawaiian Hawaiian basically is a
catchall term for anything you grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what apparently what used to be grown
out there was some combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombians, Mexicans, Thais.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then some of that stuff was mixed
with Afghans for structure and weight and
[SPEAKER_00]: this and that, you know, and and all that
type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when when, for instance,
like they were talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the stuff that Seattle Greg and those
guys were getting in the 70s or 80s that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were mixing with their Afghans,
they were getting Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that was probably some
combination of Colombian, Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican blended together and or maybe
mixed with Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is kind of is kind of that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Hawaii used to be a pretty bomb
place to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the problem became is when the
helicopters started flying in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s and stuff, there's not very much
landmass in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like northern California or other
areas where they just have this vast area
[SPEAKER_00]: to search through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, volcanic areas that
it's really easy to see if there's a weed
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's jungle areas that are unsuitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only so many, you know,
human area, human habitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the area they have to cover is
pretty small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be too hard to just fly up a
little bit and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a big boom in the 60s and 70s
of people growing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as the helicopters
started flying, a lot of people got a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Hawaii kind of ceased being an
export on any major level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that it wasn't some of it
still didn't exist, but a lot of it moved
[SPEAKER_00]: into greenhouses and moved onto the edge
of jungles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became really difficult to get off off
any kind of large scale stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because the islands are so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Matt did his interview with with
Greg, I think was the very first Reader
[SPEAKER_00]: Syndicate interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he talked about he thought that
the Hawaiian that they were using in L5
[SPEAKER_00]: was some blend of Mexican and Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was his was his.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was his take some kind of
Mexican Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which would have been pretty common
because that would have been two of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main imports, seeded weed imports that
were coming into America at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so I have a small tie
to to Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I lived there or anything like
that, because I never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the strains that I still have
is we call it the Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of all places, I met a guy from Maui
in the in ninety four in Amsterdam who had
[SPEAKER_00]: come out there to trade seeds with some of
the breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we shared a joint and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was with some friends and he gave us
a small handful of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them became the Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have truck stops in Hawaii is what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so they I mean, they have a whole
district district.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't even have they don't
even call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just they just it's very much more
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and so being 19 or whatever the fuck I
was, I asked zero intelligent questions of
[SPEAKER_00]: this man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he was a super old timer,
which he was probably about my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was probably in the 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to a 19 year old, he seemed a grizzled
veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that trip, I spent thousands
of dollars on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing that I ended up keeping
was this female from a handful of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that he gave me when we shared a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pretty interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of all the Dutch that that particular
trip, which was was one it was my it was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually my first trip to Amsterdam,
believe it or not, in 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: That particular trip, I didn't find
anything that was a keeper amongst the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I bought initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember what you bought?
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bought an elf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to sensei in 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought an L five haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought an L five skunk one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought super skunk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I bought some, you know,
I, I, I think I bought some bubble gum
[SPEAKER_00]: that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bought I bought a random I bought
some stuff from maybe Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of buying, well, I was 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of buying like three or four
things and buying like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 seeds of each thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bought like 15 or 18 things and
like one or two packs of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you like crack a pack and it's 10
seeds and you get four females and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was that wasn't at the era I was so
young then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't at the era where we were like
keeping males or breeding or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing too is I got that Maui
and we tossed all the males because they
[SPEAKER_00]: were fucking useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do with those?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but but so Hawaii and Hawaiian
is definitely, you know, in that it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of it's in the lexicon.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, someone just said,
oh, Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui Waui was is kind of like Matt Nuska
Thunderfuck or this or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a catch all term.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was originally made by a guy
named Fast Eddie from the Brotherhood of
[SPEAKER_02]: Eternal Love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there really was a Maui Waui at one
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike Matt Nuska Thunderfuck,
we can't trace it to one person,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that one we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what has become Maui Waui?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of what we see as Maui Waui
are mostly Afghan dominant types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, you know, they used to they used
to ship some of that stuff in macadamia
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to ship it to the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to hide it in the center of
macadamia nut tins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, Hawaiian was sort of a
was sort of a catch all phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no indigenous Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all basically entrepreneurs
bringing other indigenous weed to Hawaii
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to figure out how to get
worthwhile buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is basically what it boiled down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what's interesting about
like the Hawaiian that I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call the only reason why we call
it the Maui is because I was dumb and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't ask any fucking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing that we knew was the
dude was from Maui.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Fast Eddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt you met you met Fast Eddie because
the Fast Eddie that you probably met was a
[SPEAKER_00]: very famous dude from Dead Tour who is
part of the wrecking crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you met Fast Eddie from the
Brotherhood of Eternal Love, but around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I've never been able to get a
hold of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact the Fast Eddie that most
people are familiar with is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrecking crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was he was a pretty famous person on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, yeah, that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was a pretty famous dude on
Deadlock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went to Dead Tour on any level,
you probably heard him be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: does he had the deepest voice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does he would scream at little kids and
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all drunk and they were just
a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an aspect where, you know,
so that's why Hawaiian is anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: got brought to Hawaii and got grown there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just gets the name Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like a lot of what we've talked
about this before, but just like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff where it obscures like we give
nicknames to things and it obscures the
[SPEAKER_00]: origin of where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Hawaiian did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Seattle Grey got Hawaiian,
which isn't very helpful that he get pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican, pure Colombian, a blend,
a blend with Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said the best you could tell was
after Mexican, Colombian, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the best you could tell was Mexican,
Colombian, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and so that's what got
blended in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, especially, you know,
nobody knew that all this stuff was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be famous and lineage and all that was
going to get poured over and be super
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notes were a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is like saying, oh, I got the
Californian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is the California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica that made it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got I got the Californian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like gives you an idea of where the
area was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, what's interesting is
that being that I'm not from Hawaii and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really have any ties there,
I do have we I do have some good friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that grew up on the island on various
islands and grown there their whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I showed them pictures and
flowers of my Maui cut, they did say that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was that wasn't that uncommon of a
phenotype that they had seen in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: in Hawaiian that they had grown from the
past.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so Hawaii is sort of like a
catchall from people get stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, like, like there was
even a thing we were talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of episodes ago during the chem dog
episode where there's a Maui dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it called Maui dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because someone got supposedly a dog bud
seed and took it to Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opted on Maui and now it's Maui dog.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interesting thing, there's some
pictures of Maui on my page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a bunch of Afghan influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at it, the leaves are
incredibly skinny and double serrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this aspect where it's my audio
kicking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just off my back off from your video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can hear you, but it's just off
from your speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like you're in a kung fu movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like I'm in a kung fu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it better now?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry that sorry that it's ad libbed or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm dubbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so my Maui is, you know,
CSI is always looking to do things that
[SPEAKER_00]: match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in addition to my headband,
you know, I've shared a bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with him in the hopes that he would breed
it and it would get out to a wider
[SPEAKER_00]: audience a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that's going to get
dropped with Matt and CSI is my Maui by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hawaiian Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I don't know if that one or Maui
by NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be just be it might be Maui by
NL5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, he used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and so there's an aspect to
where it's like, you know, it's been out
[SPEAKER_00]: there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cut from Mandelbrot called The
Truth, which is Maui by Superdog that I
[SPEAKER_00]: made 20 plus years ago or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's percolated around and it's kind of
been a Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a Mendocino County classic
because it's probably not now with the way
[SPEAKER_00]: the market is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a long time, it was one of those
cuts that you could put outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: reliably get four or five pounds off it
and it would be done in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: October.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's very decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I remember seeing pictures of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never I don't think I've ever smoked
Maui, but I've never seen pictures of it
[SPEAKER_02]: and thinking it was absolutely gorgeous,
especially for an outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns purple in the cold,
you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's obviously some kind of
sativa Afghan blend, because if you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the buds and the density and how quick
it finishes, it's got a heavy Afghan,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but its leaves are like that's I
mean, it's like super skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even fatten really.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like consistently skinny the
whole way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got a bunch of double
serrations, which it smell like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it smells kind of it smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one of those ones where when
I asked, oh, God, let's not do that yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'll get all irritated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones where I've asked
trimmers for years and years what it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get ranges from my favorite is,
you know, Wrigley Wrigley Fruity Gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's got a super distinctive
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say jokingly that it's I joke
that it's like my longest female
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship because we popped that seed
in 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's 28 years this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've had her literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the next to the crystal chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the second weed that I ever really
started religiously cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in Indiana or Chicago or
Illinois area and you ever smoked the
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui, it's very likely it's the same cut
because that's where we cropped it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bunch of friends grew it out there
and probably still grow it here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it's not elite by today's
standards in terms of like the high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's probably it's kind of good house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not up there with the best of
the best in my opinion, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's got a bunch of amazing qualities
and it it's you know, it breeds really
[SPEAKER_00]: well for color and frost and structure and
all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll probably be another show,
but it is blended into some very famous
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you know, that we won't dive into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all I know is all I know is where it's
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from an old dude on Maui that had
been growing there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically said he grew things and
acclimated them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came over to Amsterdam to trade
seeds with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would bring stuff back and mix it
into his lines and da da da da da da.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he said it was an Afghan that
finished quick and yielded well and was
[SPEAKER_00]: rot resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see the, you know,
you could see the sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it and so I have pretty high hopes
that CSI will blend it into a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different things because it's such a
stable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other part about it that I really
like is that when any time you get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's that old, it's lineage
ties to something completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: than what's a mishmash of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything from the mid 90s doesn't really
have any of the most famous 40 or 50 cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that we usually talk about that's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times when you're breeding,
you get the best results when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding things that are kind of unlike
each other and not too related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not related to cam or Kush or this
or that or da da da da da da, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it hasn't been overused and
overblended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so there's a Matt sent me a
thing this morning about all the I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, I started reading stuff and got
distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we could one day do I we
have some good friends that probably would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot better experts on like Hawaiian
growing culture and the famous strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really feel it's like my place to
like lead a kind of discussion like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an area where my knowledge goes
hella deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I couldn't talk on Molokai
frost like people are asking or quite
[SPEAKER_02]: electric.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't talk on any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, I've heard plenty
of stories secondhand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had, you know, I know a bunch of
growers from over there and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but, you know, we could do a
whole episode where people could ask
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, you know, but we did think it
was worth mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did think it was cool to talk about
because Hawaiian is sort of getting like
[SPEAKER_00]: brought back in because of this interest
in the NL and NL five and what Greg was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, maybe maybe there's an
aspect of like talking about what Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Hawaiian is is sort of and
like what Hawaiian was isn't what Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what Hawaiian was back then might
have been a mix of Colombian and Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: and some Afghans and stuff that the
Brotherhood of Eternal Love was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Hawaii now is just another place that
clones get sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got cherry pie and it's got skunks
and it's got this and it's got kems and da
[SPEAKER_00]: da da da da.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so on and so on and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cool place in the sense that
there's a you know, it's super humid there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a totally different environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to find things that do
well in that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can have Pakalolo in Paradise on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I didn't want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some resources and some friends
that would be far more educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's their neck of the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To talk about that kind of stuff than we
would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to bring it up in the sense
that we've been getting a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about Hawaiian and Hawaiian
lights and a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your Maui and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Maui is one of those ones
where I even lost it, sadly, for a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of years due to some unfortunate
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it was a classic grown by old
timers around my area in Mendo,
[SPEAKER_00]: it lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, like I said, you know,
there was, you know, in an era where like
[SPEAKER_00]: weed was weed to some degree, you know,
a four to six pound reliable plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was done in the middle of October was
pretty beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of one of those things I
brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it out in 98 or whatever and
started spreading it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of percolated around our
area off and on since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few friends that have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly probably under pressure
with how few strains sell currently,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and how rough the market has
become and how low the market has become
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it definitely still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it to, like I said, I gave it to
CSI to breed with, you know, and preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: or help preserve, you know, it's always
it's always risky when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: save things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find people that have an
interest in stuff that were willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there could be a fire,
there could be an accident, there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: a bus, there could be any number of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are talking about what's Aloha
White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know much about Aloha White
Widow except for Amsterdam, except for it
[SPEAKER_00]: was White Widow from Amsterdam popped on
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aloha Seeds was from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aloha Seeds was from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were a Dutch company and they
they made it and they just called it Aloha
[SPEAKER_02]: White Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody assumed it was, you know,
a Hawaiian White Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even assumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just assumed that it was a it was
another one of those things where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, you're in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just one of those things where it's
like, oh, it's from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's add Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually called Aloha Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Amsterdam, God, when I first heard
about the strength, I wanted to see if I
[SPEAKER_02]: could still source it at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they wouldn't even talk about what
was in it or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was it was their their seed
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't just they just weren't
interested in selling it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of one of those things where
Soma decided to call a line New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll call it diesel because it was
the first, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was mistaken right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't actually know its back history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never personally grown it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I think probably like 99 percent of
people had no clue that it was Aloha Seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's just how it's always gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was at the Aloha Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's one of the things that
Matt and I always talk about, where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like you can make misleading statements
and not outright lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people will just assume Yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These genetics are authentic.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I was super stoked a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a joke about how you could rename
blueberry or blue dream and call it
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry fucking yum yum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone would probably buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just today saw a strain called blueberry
yum yum taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, somebody's talking about NCGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 percent wrong.
You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, there's the the the the
name game and then creating assumptions
[SPEAKER_00]: based on that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, 20 years ago,
if something was was named after some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of smell or aroma or whatever,
it probably had some kind of distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: remembrance of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's it has no connection to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is it a ludicrous song?
[SPEAKER_02]: I call a blueberry yum yum out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But goddamn, it's hard being original.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have known that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard being original.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, there's there's an
aspect where, you know, Hawaiian,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's probably going to remain a
mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when any time any time you have like a
mystery, right, that's hard to be proven,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get people that are going
to claim that they have knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have facts behind the rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, well, you might not
have had the Hawaiian that went to Greg,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my that was my dad's best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my, you know, my aunt's,
you know, my my aunt's boyfriend,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever, you know, because you can't
really refute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really popular in cannabis is
being able to not refute things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, you saw just just in this
episode, just in this 20 minutes or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever that we've been live,
you saw one person come in here,
[SPEAKER_02]: ask for an opinion because they weren't
sure and then flip out because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: counter to what they wanted to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very good at patting my head and
rubbing my stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ignore a lot of the comments,
not because they're not valuable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because I have a hard time like
bullshitting and reading at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my brain was in here repeatedly
asking about someone nonstop and then
[SPEAKER_02]: asked about someone that referred him to
that person, someone from Virginia,
[SPEAKER_02]: that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just like, dude, stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's and there's aspects to where it's
like sometimes people make a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption that like this is old enough
and this is mysterious enough that it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: never be out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of them that do it think that
think that it's old enough and it's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's I mean, we even saw it when I
won't even mention their name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did this that we outed somebody a
few years ago that consistently had he was
[SPEAKER_00]: a younger cat and he consistently had
strains that were from one to two years
[SPEAKER_00]: before they were ever released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could just tell that they were
just hunting on the forums for early info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they figured they'd they'd
ratchet it back for a year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they didn't realize that there
was people that were actually alive and in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, he didn't even that dude
didn't even go look at the catalogs to see
[SPEAKER_02]: if he could get the you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't even talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I first saw him on Instagram,
I thought that dude was like in his 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would have had to have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I figured and then I figured out
he was like 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what in the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and yeah, there's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's multiple people that that
have claimed, you know, that have claimed
[SPEAKER_00]: connection to various seed banks or
various people or various this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the cool things
about the Internet is that it's linked a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get a chance to, you know,
you get a chance to ask those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, you know, and so,
you know, there's yeah, someone picked it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk 18 fam, Uncle Fester Skunk 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature fraud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed someone mentioned about the
seeds being federally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: First, that's from a source like a single
source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not 100 percent sure on what they
posted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if if cannabis seeds were to be
classified as hemp seeds, you'd still need
[SPEAKER_02]: a hemp license.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a seed distribution license and
you'd only be distributing in your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I think I send it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can send it out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the issue is, is that you
can't just be like, I'm going to send my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy in Florida a bunch of seeds and
write hemp and we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you have to have there has to be
legitimate companies in both states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because hemp is hemp is registered in the
state of California as a California hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd have to send it to a registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how it works?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to be in the market for them to
buy the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hemp is hemp was put in the farm
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's legal in all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a state by state thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even hemp transports where you
can transport legal hemp clones from one
[SPEAKER_00]: state to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you still to this day, after working
at the hemp farm, I know that they cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: buy anything not licensed to be sold in
California by a hemp registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, technically it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's but it's still like you have
to have two hemp businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be a legitimate sale between
hemp businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I'm going to send a bunch of
hemp seeds legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't gotten to the point where it's
like tomato seeds or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's just like enthusiasts can just
trade whatever the fuck they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just ran through this and
experienced it with the California hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: laws and like registered trying to
register to be a breeder of hemp and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like you have to do go through so many
fucking hoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's just California, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to go through so many hoops
to be able to grow hemp in California for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure I'm sure state by state
they can put their own regulations on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't believe that any state can
make hemp illegal because it's a federally
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal on the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's not illegal, but it's
heavily regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what happened is, is that all
these people in all these different states
[SPEAKER_00]: jumped into hemp and there wasn't a
pipeline for that much CBD or CBG or hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: products yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are saying that like Costco
doesn't have a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're selling hemp that's been
treated with heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole nother different kind of
license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's been treated with heat,
it's unviable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course they can sell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's that's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there's but yeah, there's
there's been I mean, that's one of the one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the reoccurring frauds in cannabis is
just like, you know, since new people are
[SPEAKER_00]: in every five or ten years, you can
recycle the same garbage over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people get all mad and they start
coming on and defending themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the people that told the lie
first, they start to change aspects of it
[SPEAKER_00]: because they realize they've been outed,
you know, and they have to shift what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one of those it's just one
of those areas that's like right for
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe maybe I should maybe I should
do like I never do a plug on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe I should do like a plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time you see like, quote unquote,
my headband cut or like when I just talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Maui or anything like that,
like my entire intention for spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics is for people to have good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I I don't I don't I'm not
making anything off of off of off these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not profiting in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to jump into the seed game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a bunch of friends trying me to
trying to get me to one of them is on is
[SPEAKER_00]: is on your screen right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've resisted, you know, and it's
nothing it's nothing against people that
[SPEAKER_00]: make seed for money or anything like that,
because obviously I have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like part of passing out, you know,
clones and stuff like that to good friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially CSI is that he's got enough
of Matt and CSI and others have enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: a customer base that you can get good
stuff out there that's different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways that like,
you know, I've said it before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but probably the person that probably the
person that did the biggest guarantee that
[SPEAKER_00]: my Mendo perps will never disappear from
the community is Caleb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he fell in love with it and he
grew he crossed it to a shit ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enough people bought that that even if
the mom was to terribly get lost,
[SPEAKER_00]: her children and grandchildren are frickin
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really if you want to talk
about legacy with seeds, or anything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, anytime anything gets popular,
like all of a sudden, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb releases some LL, some Chem D and
LA, and some and some TK in LA,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That he reversed and people are finding
amazing things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now for the first time ever,
all of a sudden you start to see clone
[SPEAKER_00]: sellers popping up with the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you start to see frickin and
you start to see, you know, people popping
[SPEAKER_00]: up with with, you know, crosses that have
it, you know, and all that different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's just one of the
things that goes along with popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could probably go back six
months and before our year before I
[SPEAKER_00]: started talking about it and nobody has
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nobody was ever talking about the LA
Kush headband before we started talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody was mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not that it hadn't existed before,
not that it didn't exist with Mandelbrot
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds 15 years ago or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the last five or six years,
it was it was nowhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and now all of a sudden,
and really, it only got my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even want it to have my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were just trying to differentiate
like how what to call what headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they attached it to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, people always assume that
I'm getting some royalty or I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of, you know, aspect or I'm
getting cuts or, you know, payback or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're assuming also sometimes that
you verified said cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I verified it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's an aspect to it
where it's like the only reason why I
[SPEAKER_00]: passed it out to a few good friends is
just to hopefully have people that get
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that I like a whole bunch and get
that into some hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so everybody knows, you know,
so if you start seeing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people pop up on clone traders and this
and that and everything else, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm the only person on earth that has
it, but it's very, very small circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's most likely a scam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you know, if it becomes
incredibly popular, like everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll probably leak and there'll be some,
you know, but I mean, it's really just,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, somebody somebody's finding a bunch of
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 400 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm breeding with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got seeds of it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the seed name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it's as far back as like as
people in Amsterdam not wanting to give
[SPEAKER_00]: out lineage just so their competitors
would all copy that lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just for clarification on
that, like it's not and there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with selling seeds or this or that
or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like my entire breeding is like
not been that's not been I bred for
[SPEAKER_00]: because I like to lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think it makes some people
mad that they can't attack me for fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: them over, like breeding her me shit or
this or that or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and and really when it comes down to it,
too, is like, you know, a bunch of our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends have been talking to talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, if this seed crash leads to
a financial crash for a bunch of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might go back to a small handful of
enthusiasts making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think it will be.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ninety five percent of the people
as you know, have gotten into seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in the last five or six years
with the intention that it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: another revenue stream and it could get
their name out there and it could get this
[SPEAKER_00]: and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason why so much stuff
today comes from so few breeders from 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago is because nobody bothered to
breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't all that common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was there wasn't money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a lot of money in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think there's a lot of money in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, but there's only a few people making
a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's only a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's and you know, and so there was
a minute there in I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: where people could sell seeds and make
their own private hybrids and like sell
[SPEAKER_00]: them to their followers and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be collapsing a little
bit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see in two or three years how
many of those people really love making
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and care about breeding and which
ones it was just another avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's there's anything wrong with
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I have seen a massive the one thing I
mean, whether people hate me or like me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gone away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen a massive overturn since
I've gotten here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm I'm expecting a super massive
overturn because I mean, just in the past
[SPEAKER_02]: five years, you know, thousands of people
making seeds trying to sell that this
[SPEAKER_02]: popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to get a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem, too, is that since
most people started recently, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're grabbing what they have available
to them that's recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this breeding is like all the same
five or six, you know, five or six years
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most recent, most famous stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I don't think that you're going to
find anything magically different crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry pie and Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people have tried that over
and over and over and over ad nauseam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and you're probably not
going to find anything new using
[SPEAKER_00]: kushments.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not even dissing those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying nothing unique to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems unique from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was there's a guy
commenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of people that had the
surprising thing about about the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: My headband cut is not that it's mine or
whatever, because I didn't make it or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but that most people won't hold
on to anything unless it's making the
[SPEAKER_00]: money right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an enormous amount of stuff
like, you know, 15 years ago, I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: dozens and dozens of growers that had
Urkel and grape ape and GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And green crack even.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as the market changed,
six people kept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of people that had
headband 15 years ago, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sours, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I even had a friend call me the
other day who's lifelong resident of
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Humboldt, and they're looking for
sour cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the last two or three years,
everybody has been popping all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, working with all this candy and
all this dessert and all this purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people are starting to ask for it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody kept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be able to get it back again
eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe they don't get back the same
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why a lot of people don't have
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, Urkel was one of the most
grown things up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that had more than 10 lights in
Mendo was growing Urkel or grape ape or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all growing purples.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you know, and then,
you know, when sour and Kush came in,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody dropped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: When cookies came in, a bunch of people
dropped sours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this came in, a bunch of people
dropped that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think there's going to be a
renaissance of some of those strains
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're better, in my opinion,
than a lot of the modern cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're longer lasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more unique eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they will make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but you know, there's I mean,
my sour that I have, I've had this sour
[SPEAKER_00]: since the very early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not most of the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've collected a whole bunch of them and
it's not most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't found one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't found one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept hoping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, maybe it's the Choco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the Joe B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the ECSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the NYCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really hard is you really can't
tell diesels apart by pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all tend to look super scum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to grow them side by side
and you really have to kind of smoke them
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to pick out differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you know, what I know about
my sour is that it's old and that we kept
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the headband got renamed sour by
a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got, you know, it got tossed around,
but it was a little bit more finicky than
[SPEAKER_00]: regular sour and it could freak out on you
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people got rid of it because
it wasn't as easy as the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then people get rid of their
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I've learned is that if
I would have lost my sour cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I have six or seven other
different ones right now, none of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of people that always
talk about, you know, I tried to get back
[SPEAKER_00]: that thing that I had and I can't find the
sour diesel cut or the blue dream cut or
[SPEAKER_00]: the GDP cut or the Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this one's good, but it's not,
but it's not, it's not what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, Duke, you made a good comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the skunk search should start in a
sour S one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree, but I think the places I saw
it the most were when you cross two
[SPEAKER_02]: different expressions of super skunk was
where I was seeing it just constantly pop
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was, but I think that you
can probably find that in a sour S one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you can't make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is with sour S ones is that
like it fails or you get like 20 seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why, that's why I even went with
crossing two super skunks that are,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are different expressions,
like a sour and a diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do agree with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that diesels are modern skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the most classic
examples of a modern skunkoid type plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesels are modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good thing about the diesels is
that unlike a lot of other things where
[SPEAKER_00]: you could be like, Oh, that one's fake or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the diesels are pretty fucking
nice, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They burn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, you know, they range in gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more headband aromas stuff like that,
but grown well taken long enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: dried right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's one of my favorite
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's probably like at
this point from my experimentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's at least 10 or 12 cuts that are
all different from each other that
[SPEAKER_00]: circulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course everyone wants to be like,
Oh, mine's the oldest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's the one you remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you should pay extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some out for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In clone form or in weed form,
because I can try it, take, take it back
[SPEAKER_00]: right to 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know the bros that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for most of those people haven't
been growing since 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever, you know, I just,
I just mean in the sense that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's like, then it becomes,
you know, that's really what it becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a marketing gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, you know, they, a lot of them
still exist and they're, most of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I didn't like very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked, I liked, um, uh, your grove,
the Amish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never tried it before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was that those couple of years
that I brought it to the party.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the diesels you grew were flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all had that mouth coating thing in
common, but they were all super flavorful
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never really had much diesel outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that year, it wasn't straight outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a little bit more control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sun grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sun grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a, I'm an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that's not fucking pure indoor
to me is outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, somebody mentioned, somebody
mentioned, I'll bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody mentioned PIP's ECSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, PIP gave me his ECSD to try,
uh, as one of my, like, which one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: sours is my sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't my sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of them that I liked a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he came out to the party that
year, um, he was like, dude, I've only
[SPEAKER_00]: grown it this good once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I mean, some of that's
probably, I did a nice job on the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but, uh, you know, sun's real nice
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is a great light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get good weather with the sun
and you get warm, nice days that go into
[SPEAKER_00]: late October, early November, and you can
take that sour late, most people with
[SPEAKER_00]: sour, the problem that became with sour up
here is that as soon as it got the nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: people would cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably needed another 10 days to
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's real easy for it to go from being
a good nose when you cut it to turning
[SPEAKER_02]: complete booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you try to fucking cure it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen sour go bad so many times just
in the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are asking what AJ's is,
you know, I don't, I mean, I know AJ a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, but, um, you know,
what AJ's was, what AJ's was in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties and early two thousands does not
seem to be the same thing that he has
[SPEAKER_00]: currently as AJ's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's not, you know, and there's
even times where people are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, there's this like, like names
I've never heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, now there's the real sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's that Albany sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's names that like never even
existed during the forum days or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, but there's new terms that are
popping up the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people will be like, I'm
convinced that this real deal sour is your
[SPEAKER_00]: headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck would you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could give it to me and I'll try it,
I suppose, or whatever, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not, I can't tell you, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like I said, luckily most of these
cuts of diesel cuts are real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them get you nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them burn well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, yeah, I mean,
Amherst sour diesel, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking, I mean, he's, he's passed now,
but Mandelbrot made that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my sour diesel that I gave to him
that he crossed into a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just decided that it was from
Amherst and added Amherst to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what he thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get it from Amherst, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it, it sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albany real, the real sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a, that's not a leading
statement, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It convinced people the origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the real one, the real one,
the original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original, original, the real original,
real verified.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them, you know, it seems like
the Choco cut is the same thing as the
[SPEAKER_00]: ECSD, but these names are so, it's kind of
like Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names get so interchangeable that one
piece for one person's Diablo OG could be
[SPEAKER_00]: another person's SFE.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and all that, you know,
so, um, you know, and, and really like
[SPEAKER_00]: when I got my sour cut, um, it came
helpfully later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have any moniker on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I never got, I never got AJ's or
Rez's or Choco or ECSD because I already
[SPEAKER_00]: had the diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what is a plant spank or sour?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so yeah, people, people get,
people get stuff that gets attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who's is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it comes from this dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's his.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, Amish got named it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it came out of Pennsylvania and
there's a bunch of Amish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was from Shroomy and it's also
called Shroomy's diesel too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also called Shroomy's diesel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so there, you know, there's,
there's a lot of stuff like that where
[SPEAKER_00]: nicknames get added and subtracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the real deal sour is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the Albany sour is,
but it's like, as, as more of the story
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out, I would assume that like Albany
is just trying to tie it to Manny and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the original sour people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what's funny?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we know the term from Vondo
that they called the sour that they all
[SPEAKER_02]: preferred the Manny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't really mention that much,
but I guarantee that someone's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: pop up with that motherfucking Manny in
two weeks or a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I mean, there's, and you know,
and, and so sometimes one of those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, just, just like the,
the dog isn't really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really, you know, skunk VA's dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he gets on the forums and he's the
first guy talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which cut is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's the skunk VA cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's not so his headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're trying to figure out some
kind of language to chat about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Matt Riott's 12 inch cock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I, yeah, that's just the
difference between our measurements and
[SPEAKER_00]: metric and metric, you know, people
getting inches, inches and centimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, totally confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally confused inches and
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, you know, and, and no,
I mean, someone just said, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the preservation, I'm not even
dissing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known a skunk VA for 20, 20 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's not my intention
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying he didn't attach his name
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was actually a Caleb who
attached his attached skunk VA's name to
[SPEAKER_02]: it because that was the source that it
came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, so, you know, which had,
you know, which headband?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, not so his headband,
you know, uh, yeah, I hate that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even use, I don't even,
I don't even like that word hate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really despise the murder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, the funny thing is like the 56
day, that's what it was told to me when I
[SPEAKER_00]: got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No six, but it's not 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like nine weeks or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least someone just said sun simulator
had something to do with since any of me
[SPEAKER_02]: later had nothing to do with the creation
of diesel, but he did make some nice
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a cool strawberry diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompa headband is most likely a,
uh, OG Kush S1 bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, Loompa did name that
motherfucker after himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did, he did have an ego boost and
name it after himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was intentional, but sometimes it's
not intentional skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't intend on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually chem dog got a little hyphy
about it because it was like technically
[SPEAKER_00]: his cut and all of a sudden people are
calling it skunk VA's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm kind of embarrassed about
my, you know, not so as headband because,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, I don't really attach myself
to stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't name it not so as Mendo
perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or anything like that,
like, you know, I guess you gotta have
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on whether or not you want to have
a, an ego attachment to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but really when it comes down to
it, when you get back to breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the stupid names, all the attachments,
all the, everything else, the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that people are going to remember is if
it's good weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone's getting down to like 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's cover some of that real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this thing going around right
now that really irritates the piss out of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, there's a, you know, they've been
pushing all this stuff with the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: cup judging and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SC labs has come out with this new
classification and they're trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of using Sativa and Indica,
which that's a different discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree that, that we, that there could be
better terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be better terminology applied
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they want to replace it to,
um, is they, and what they're using for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald cup this year is the most
ridiculous bullshit I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because they have
six categories and I'll try to do them off
[SPEAKER_00]: of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's Hayes, Jack and Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, um, this probably won't be an
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, OG and gas.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweets and dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet and dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what's the final one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical and floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical and floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are two different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that's the most ridiculous
smell and terpene classifications I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever heard in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is exotic?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do they go off the exotic Mike
definition of exotics where Runts is an
[SPEAKER_02]: exotic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, just exotic is like exotic
is something that's unusual to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all exotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, like maybe some Southeast
Asians, I would consider exotics or some
[SPEAKER_02]: wild Africans.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you live there, it's not exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies might be exotic to you over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is sweets and dreams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweets and dreams is the one that makes
the like no sense to me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then, you know, like,
and then there's an aspect of,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, so you've got sweets plus dreams and
then you've got desserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I get dessert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies has a marketing campaign where
everything they name is dessert based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get the whole, so they have
cookies and they have sherbert and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have flan and they have fucking this and
that bullshit and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of it tastes like the specific
dessert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, they have a theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that cookies, the original thin
mint, which they can't say anymore because
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scouts suit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did have kind of a doughy flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't get that from any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I taste is OG, but I know people do do
get that from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's also like how you smell,
how you taste.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can at least, okay, it's got
some kind of doughy type aroma to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that some people, but what is
exotics?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was neither thin nor mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is, what is exotics?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is, what is dessert weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is dreams?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is dreams?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that even fucking mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like blue dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Jack and Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jack and Hayes in California,
like, um, you know that it's mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's by no means the only Hayes
aromas in Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I would put blue dream in the
Jackson Hayes category.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than I would like a blueberry
category, but I certainly wouldn't make a
[SPEAKER_02]: category for dreams based off one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's like even if,
so even like all in back in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there's a bunch of Hayes cuts that
are still pretty famous and kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't, the best ones they
have back there aren't turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't smell like Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell like frankincense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell like church.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell, there's a variety of smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to respond to one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, someone said they are leaning into
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And chemo bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not based on chemo bar,
which I think is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate the effort in advancing
the discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is this discussion was already
advanced past indica and sativa and hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's only the people that aren't
very well read on the subject that are
[SPEAKER_02]: still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still there, which is just so
everyone knows that when you're judging at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald Cup, all these jars are
labeled and no one has any, supposedly has
[SPEAKER_00]: any idea what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to just, just blind smoke
and gas and smell and look and share.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't come with, Oh, this is white
runs from X and X farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sample number one 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we're going to name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this, is this dessert to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this dreams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel dreamy when you smoke this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this dream that that still blows my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, you know, even the, even the,
even the OG, even the OG and gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like in OG there's piney there's
earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much depth in OG itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't just combine diesel and Kush
into the same category as gassy OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about, what about the, the,
like the Irene ones that are more sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: cereal OGs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like ones that are, ones that are like
lemony and pine soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ones that are straight earthy mouth
coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really to me, I'm not trying to,
to diss them or whatever, but it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really is a step backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't want that kind of
language to start being used because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, what the fuck is dreams?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is dreams?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing, my point was like, I,
I agree in advancing the conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: because I do not think Indica,
Indica and Sativa and hybrid are accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, someone already did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like someone pointed out Merlin and,
and Clark came up with the broadleaf
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant narrow leaf drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Broadleaf drug type, narrow leaf drug
type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, I mean, you, you know,
you can classify it any other way,
[SPEAKER_03]: but those BLD and NLD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: BLD and NLD is a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it doesn't talk about the high type.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just talks about the, the outward
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we should, you know,
we're planning on having our buddy crybaby
[SPEAKER_00]: come on one of these shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have like a terpene and
an aroma episode because he can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: talk more intelligently about those kinds
of things than we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a better language, but really
what this is, it's about communication and
[SPEAKER_00]: language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about our eyes,
it's really easy to be like, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: periwinkle or this is burgundy,
or this is orange, or this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can be like, yes, that is,
we can both see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to, to nose,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than sour, bitter, dead,
salty, there's only like five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you actually taste.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest is impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will be like, Oh, this smells
like pencil shavings or a fresh car,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it smells like, you know, something
common like oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't really describe the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You describe something else that it smells
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but that classification, what the
fuck does dreams smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does exotic smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what used to be exotic in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.
Huh?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spices from the far East.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can have exotic,
exotic dragon fruit, but if you live in
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii, it's probably not exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, you know, mangoes were
probably exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had those before?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh vinyl, linoleum, you know,
new car smell, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a whole bunch of those
things where it's like, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to have the language to talk
about smells with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm bad at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, and I always, I always,
when trimmers and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always try to ask them away from the
rest of the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you smell when you smell this
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to get a bunch of different
people's feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do I see things that people keep
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a commonality that you can pull
out of their impressions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not everybody has the same
impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, how would Europeans
know roadkill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no roadkill in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: No roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what they mean when they talk
about roadkill.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have been more specific,
but it's like, you're not American.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no, you've never smelled a dead
skunk on the side of the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you came here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's an aspect where it's
like, I looked at all this stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got all these judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: This motherfucker don't understand the
concepts of monoturpenes, triterpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: sesquiterpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, you obviously don't understand
the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go back to the fucking element.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk about terpenes and you can
talk about individual terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like the language around how those
terpenes blend into different aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like just like there's,
there's only so many primary colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, terpenes, you can combine
two different things and have them smell
[SPEAKER_02]: the exact same way, no matter what
terpenes you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's certain ways to
make strawberry smells and there's other
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to make strawberry smells that are
very similar that two people could smell
[SPEAKER_02]: as strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is- It's not a terpene
conversation in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of, the level of education
amongst people to discuss aromas and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is very limited, even amongst the
educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a limited conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think it's advanced by and
they're all pushing, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're breaking barriers and here's how
we're judging stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got different colored stickers
to put on jars, whether it's dessert or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's haze or whether it's exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that's a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the categories are not related to
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's not dissing them,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dissing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if anything, it's probably dissing
SC labs maybe, but it's just, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: another way to try to talk about language
and talk about classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most weed before cookies, nobody said,
nobody was like, oh my God, all this weed
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like desserts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, this is flan at my favorite
Mexican restaurant to a T.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just exhale flan.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just exhale strawberry shortcake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll be a good episode with
crybaby too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's way more knowledgeable about that in
the language than I am on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got, he's, he's got a much deeper
base of talking about the language and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and stuff like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do Matt's phone is going
to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some stuff I got to take care of and
whatnot, but we're going to do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally we try to take it to like an hour
and a half, two hours every Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut it a little short today
for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just kind of wanted to do,
no matter what we wanted to kind of bring
[SPEAKER_00]: people together on Friday night,
bullshit about different subjects with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, give people things to talk and
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Matt, if you want to do any plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Google type in breeder syndicate,
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to join the Patreon,
we have our discord where we talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incessantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're fucking nerds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's what we love to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our Hawaiian life stuff dropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I did not take a picture of
all the hybrids like I was going to and
[SPEAKER_02]: print out, but there are some really
awesome hybrids that CSI did with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaiian life stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be dropping probably
this weekend, but expect to see some old
[SPEAKER_02]: rare shit in there, including the bomb
threat bubble, which hasn't been released
[SPEAKER_02]: in ages in any hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a good cut too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown that one myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fun, it's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, you know, and you can always
reach out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always give us, you can always hit
us up on Instagram or on discord and give
[SPEAKER_00]: us ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'd love for you guys to talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to learn more about whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're super open about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to bullshit on a weekly basis
about cannabis and keep people interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Teedco.com Hawaiian lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: F2 open pollination is up right now and
tomorrow are the fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you on the discord,
we're going to get together for the
[SPEAKER_02]: fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be major awesome ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody have a great night.
