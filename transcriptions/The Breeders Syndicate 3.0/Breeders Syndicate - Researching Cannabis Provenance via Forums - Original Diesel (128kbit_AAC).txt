[SPEAKER_02]: hates it when I do that hates it he's like
trying to sleep next to me like this
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucker this is loud-ass music that
was Harry J all-stars old skinhead reggae
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff putting Bob Marley to fucking shame
anyways here we go so I'll let the I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: let people join before I get started the
clowns yeah it could sound a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: like baby elephant walk a little bit
sometimes so where this all started last
[SPEAKER_02]: night was I was looking up original diesel
and you know I have this I have this old
[SPEAKER_02]: clone had it for a long time lost it
during the Mooney thing Matt from Elite
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis sent it back and it was it's
called original diesel it's been that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: been the original diesel that I used for
the original diesel bx1 lots of projects
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other day someone asked me yo yo
what's the source on it you know I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: sure what the source is on this I remember
Shroomy's diesel being listed as original
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel but Shroomy's diesel is different
oh thank you dear there we go so I started
[SPEAKER_02]: I started digging around and what I found
was fucking crazy and I realized you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what like people that don't really have a
long experience in this and when they
[SPEAKER_02]: actually go try to look up something they
need to know who is who how to really sift
[SPEAKER_02]: through the bullshit so I decided I would
go I would go do that yes the image is
[SPEAKER_02]: good let's see you think mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: nice super silver haze is still the
original parents used in the sensei silver
[SPEAKER_02]: haze now shanty says yes I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know I don't know by the way for the
people joining and everything I said that
[SPEAKER_02]: I would give out a coupon I think this is
it oh yeah no it's this here's the coupon
[SPEAKER_02]: code for 35% off everything except the
spray it's pre pre 420 is there anywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: to get authentic super silver haze old
people's collections is about it I would
[SPEAKER_02]: say man because the super silver haze
coming out of shanty shit is nothing like
[SPEAKER_02]: what you would expect as old super silver
haze granted you could go find old Jack
[SPEAKER_02]: Caroline's you get similar phenotypes I
would say mango haze from mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: nice would be a good one there's the
coupon I might try to archive it on
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it
but we'll see but as I go through this I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not gonna be taking more questions on
other stuff so just so I could stay
[SPEAKER_02]: focused I'm gonna be putting this up so
try to keep your questions focused on what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm presenting in this because I get I'm
fucking ADHD you know it's really it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard to keep focused on anything
anyways let's see me god damn this fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: phone see wake up druggy Krish people make
it no sense see where do I start with the
[SPEAKER_02]: stupidity where do I start with the
stupidity now that would be the cheese
[SPEAKER_02]: little stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: anyways so this is where we start boom and
unfortunately I can't shrink this so I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have to see I'll bring some stuff up
on my computer because this is obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: not gonna work great if I can't fucking
shrink it but so you guys can get an idea
[SPEAKER_02]: of what I'm looking for so the first thing
I type in would be about original diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: okay let's see go to Google and type in
original diesel strain right that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: what most people would would do it so some
of the first stuff I'm seeing is that dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: underground is the breeder and original
breeder of diesel well that's fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: weird right like dr. underground from what
I know about dr. underground he's a he's a
[SPEAKER_02]: British dude he's a fucking British dude
yeah I don't think he was the one who bred
[SPEAKER_02]: original diesel so now this is seed finder
that like that'll give you your answer on
[SPEAKER_02]: whether this is a good source or not no
it's not second thing I see original sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel comes up and that's not original
sour diesel that's not what sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like either and that's from swerve
so thank you swerve for sticking bullshit
[SPEAKER_02]: up in here let's see what else we got okay
let me get in let me find this one so we
[SPEAKER_02]: get into THC Farmer now THC Farmer a lot
of times like when it comes to diesels,
[SPEAKER_02]: chems, OGs you're gonna find a lot of
topics conversations on diesels,
[SPEAKER_02]: chems, OGs, stuff like that specific cuts
and a lot of people that pretty much think
[SPEAKER_02]: that they know every fucking thing about
cannabis there let's see THC Farmer
[SPEAKER_02]: especially during a certain era original
day record diesel this is the this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the hold on I can't read shit let
me put it back here this is the original
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel day record thread you can see it up
in the corner on the farm someone says I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit confused here when I try to find
info on the strain it comes up saying it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the same cut as diesel number one headband
underdog day wrecker but I was told
[SPEAKER_02]: they're different if anyone can clear this
up that would be cool and that's a valid
[SPEAKER_02]: question that's a valid question man a lot
of people say that that it's day wrecker
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel number one headband that they're
all the same cut so then they give someone
[SPEAKER_02]: comes back someone named indica tilde
whatever that whoop sign is tour don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know who this person is I found this in my
archives I hope it helps up so this is
[SPEAKER_02]: where you that where someone first brings
up in this thread the Grateful Dead show
[SPEAKER_02]: quotes about Deer Creek Amphitheater about
Juan Kenobi the aka joe brand fucking and
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about p-bud chem-dog that whole thing
how many seeds were popped how many seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: were labeled what and but yeah it still
doesn't get down to the answer so it lists
[SPEAKER_02]: you know all the chem-dog crosses original
diesel here we go also known as diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: number one headband day record diesel
underdog came from a cross of 91 chem-dog
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed to mass super skunk crossed to
northern lights done by a guy known as
[SPEAKER_02]: weasel hmm okay so that's that's probably
been the most common and answer when
[SPEAKER_02]: referring to this up until a little bit
later up until a little bit later now down
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit further JJ New York has been
working on a chem-dog D base seed line for
[SPEAKER_02]: several years now he started crossing a
chem-dog D to sense the Afghani number one
[SPEAKER_02]: after thoroughly testing both senses
Afghani and senses Hindu Kush to determine
[SPEAKER_02]: which was more stable and would be better
for the initial cross JJ then did a back
[SPEAKER_02]: cross known as double dog several females
of this blah blah blah down under trade
[SPEAKER_02]: trade dog nothing to do with diesel this
is all to do with chem-dog D reservoir
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds red dog of reservoir seeds recent
released a chem-dog cross or several
[SPEAKER_02]: chem-dog crosses as far as part of his
Trinity Trinity charity options the
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses included chem-dog D crossed to
since since he's Hindu Kush and snow dog
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed to since he's Hindu Kush chem-dog
D sour D IBL snow dog and this all goes
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the chem 101 thread by my friend
high and lonesome so he did what I think
[SPEAKER_02]: is probably the best compendium of answers
that could be given at that time and then
[SPEAKER_02]: someone quoted him and this and and mad
props to high and lonesome for trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: dig through all that bullshit and put the
most common consensus answers out there
[SPEAKER_02]: during those years now he gives him he
gives himself a real hard time because he
[SPEAKER_02]: knows that you know a lot of things have
changed over the years and stuff but for
[SPEAKER_02]: the time it's still it's still pretty
magical that someone could put all that
[SPEAKER_02]: into a nice area I mean he goes through
the chem-dog process being og sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: all this is correct super snow diesel
bubble cam dog days chem DP bud stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that all right so is that the answer
though is the answer that is just was it
[SPEAKER_02]: chem 91 mass super northern lights well
read on quote from green green thumb Danny
[SPEAKER_02]: on THC farmer yeah D9 brother diesel day
wrecker headband all the same shit slap
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever handle you like on her boo I see
my old buddy Astarte's on here Astarte's
[SPEAKER_02]: was actually one of the first people to
pass me the white really cool dude he
[SPEAKER_02]: passed me the white DJs flow DJs blueberry
not a lot of people remember his name but
[SPEAKER_02]: he's a really good dude there's a fake
headband going around the club scene aka
[SPEAKER_02]: 707 headband and this is this is correct
it's a sour diesel og cross by all
[SPEAKER_02]: accounts not the same Lindy lineage as the
indie poster above bring this obsessing
[SPEAKER_02]: over this all right look for AJ's cut on
oh god don't I looked for AJ's cut on THC
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer that is not worth that is not worth
navigating through let's see as far as I
[SPEAKER_02]: know the real headband underdog is closely
held and not in the club scene currently
[SPEAKER_02]: and that is correct Astarte's inject some
inject some nice info
[SPEAKER_02]: okay then we have my buddy true grid on
here it's funny because he messaged
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier damn funny this thread popped up
today I've been looking for day record
[SPEAKER_02]: info for a couple days that or maybe I get
stoned or see it on here forget it was on
[SPEAKER_02]: here and then search more anyone make any
s1s along the way that still float around
[SPEAKER_02]: or is it locked up clone only so he was on
the same on the same search in 2009 trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to find info about that and he goes under
the name Los Tesoros Real really good guy
[SPEAKER_02]: really smart guy he's been on the boards a
long time so he he asked like after I
[SPEAKER_02]: posted that I was gonna do this he was
like oh great is gonna be a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: saying what they think and a lot of
bullshit and yep all right so let me
[SPEAKER_02]: scroll down now a person named Duff farmer
no Loompa did not have the real headband
[SPEAKER_02]: every site I get on there's always some
stupid uneducated debate on the chem dog
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics this is the first time I truly
feels that someone has done their research
[SPEAKER_02]: I commend you brother indicator we
appreciate it okay so I'm gonna keep
[SPEAKER_02]: scrolling down and then there are some
quotes about this the guaranteed original
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim dog with skunk VA cut which skunk VA
cut is the original Kim 91 it's got the
[SPEAKER_02]: best provenance out of everyone see that
was a guy named Reaper then there's
[SPEAKER_02]: someone showing off their booth and then
someone showing headband headband but
[SPEAKER_02]: basically it all takes this weird curve
into the headband realm right okay let's
[SPEAKER_02]: see let's see one second here and then we
go to Kim dogs original diesel so we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna go to a different thread because
this one is is already done that's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: all the info you're gonna get there see
Kim dogs original diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: headband that should take me straight to
the thread and see yeah here it is so this
[SPEAKER_02]: is the one that I I went through the most
and I thought it was worth showing the
[SPEAKER_02]: most let me see what we got the blind
leading the deaf is exactly right if John
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoover's profiles down there I think he
did a thread of AJZ John Hoover is an OJD
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go through this I actually kept
pictures because neither of those guys
[SPEAKER_02]: deserve to be mentioned on anything about
anything they're fucking retards all right
[SPEAKER_02]: here we go I gave OJD a lot more credit
than I should have because he's just been
[SPEAKER_02]: around a long time I figured he wouldn't
be a fucking retard by now right but I
[SPEAKER_02]: digress and then someone says original
diesel gives the same quote also known as
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel one headband day record underdog
came from across of 91 chem dog mass super
[SPEAKER_02]: sensing northern lights done by a guy
known as weasel now what they didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: back then is that weasel would eventually
come out and talk he speaks and he's
[SPEAKER_02]: around he's on Instagram it's not looking
so good for all weasel weasel can't keep
[SPEAKER_02]: his story straight twice and a lot of this
I don't know it's there's been there's
[SPEAKER_02]: been quite a few different quotes from him
since then anyways and I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a it's a matter of I'm gonna block El
Jefe because he's fucking getting on my
[SPEAKER_02]: nerve let's see there we go no weasel has
made several different quotes I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's attributed to age whether whether
it's being stoned I don't know but you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't get the same story right twice so
that's a problem right all right so let's
[SPEAKER_02]: go ahead and go through the farm and we're
gonna see more about this original diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: here we go Venom 818 I've seen many
dispensaries but I'm not sure it's a chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog cut did progressive options say where
they sourced it the original D and then
[SPEAKER_02]: this is here's here's our buddy swerve
here's our buddy swerve the original
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel cut going around a so callous
shroomy's original diesel it's good but
[SPEAKER_02]: not the real cut so we have swerve chiming
in with some info there thank you swerve
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Venom 818 responds thanks for the
input swerve do you know where I can get
[SPEAKER_02]: some seeds or a cut in pure form so swerve
has now put himself as a an expert in this
[SPEAKER_02]: area and people are asking him for cuts
and info on seeds why not and then we have
[SPEAKER_02]: winter who says top dog seed just had a
couple packs of underdog number one on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bay a week ago I quickly got a pack so I
was searching like you my dude now this is
[SPEAKER_02]: in 2010 I'm not sure when the original
diesel day wrecker cut aka if it is the
[SPEAKER_02]: same cut as underdog was that around in
2010 I don't know then someone named eco
[SPEAKER_02]: comes in and probably one of the smartest
things that the original diesel story
[SPEAKER_02]: seems super complicated with info as to
which ones are out or by whom who found
[SPEAKER_02]: this on a chem thread it's interesting
here we go now this was this post that's
[SPEAKER_02]: up there in the right corner right now
this one right here the weird thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: shroomy's original D clone is not the same
as chem dogs headband well that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: weird right if shroomy's D if swerve was
right that shroomy's original diesel is
[SPEAKER_02]: the one going around and it's the same
thing as headband but it's not the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing as chem dogs headband well chem dog
himself has said to me multiple times that
[SPEAKER_02]: he never had a headband never grew a
headband so that throws a little wrench in
[SPEAKER_02]: the in the in the problem it says chem
dogs smoked out swerve and a friend of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine located in Santa Barbara California
with a batch of headband and both said it
[SPEAKER_02]: was basically straight-up og cush
completely different than the original
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel cut I am very confused by the whole
headband day wrecker stuff because I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been seeing more and more of the og cush
esque headband flooding Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_02]: NorCal growers in fact chem dog even told
my buddy in Santa Barbara something along
[SPEAKER_02]: the lines that this is og bro yet this is
head yet this headband is another headband
[SPEAKER_02]: then the cut that's been going around the
board for a while now JJ New York wrote a
[SPEAKER_02]: description of the original headband day
wrecker underdog and it sounded a bit like
[SPEAKER_02]: or a lot like the original D clone he said
it smelled spicy skunky diesel II taste JJ
[SPEAKER_02]: also said I don't think chem dog ever had
an underdog headband cut so what the hell
[SPEAKER_02]: is this og ish headband cut the chem has
it's flooding the SoCal medical scene
[SPEAKER_02]: right now so overall like what you can
illustrate here is when anybody asks about
[SPEAKER_02]: the original diesel so far what keeps
happening is that it gets moved on to day
[SPEAKER_02]: wrecker yep bye-bye it gets moved on to
day wrecker unless and unless you know
[SPEAKER_02]: guys like my buddy El Jefe there have
something to add instead of just being a
[SPEAKER_02]: bitch then they get booted so I'm trying
to stay focused here anyway it always gets
[SPEAKER_02]: shoved off man like you try to go for
original diesel you'll get info on
[SPEAKER_02]: headband headband headband and there's no
there's nothing but the Canna Bible
[SPEAKER_02]: stating that they're all the same it gets
convoluted real quick and I can see why
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard for a lot of people to go
research a lot of this stuff that weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: around during all this someone asked Joe
Brand your outdoor cut or your original
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel cut is the same as the shroomy got
passed around this is actually true Juan's
[SPEAKER_02]: original diesel is the same exact cut
shroomy source from Pennsylvania which
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard is different than diesel one
day wrecker and underdog cut so just more
[SPEAKER_02]: confusion with with that now venom one
eight eight one eight says good read bro
[SPEAKER_02]: now I'm more confused right like who
wouldn't be and then some and then sway
[SPEAKER_02]: says I've noticed that pretty much every
cut from progressive options has been fake
[SPEAKER_02]: now progressive options was an old clone
only collective and in LA not even that
[SPEAKER_02]: old wasn't even that long ago that they
were still in operation but a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people went got cuts from there and bred
with them snow oh hi and several other
[SPEAKER_02]: people went down there and got cuts
because that was easier obviously than
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing them correctly and a lot of them
were fake and then we have dusty bowls aka
[SPEAKER_02]: Danimal aka backyard farmer aka however
many mean how many ever many names he
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to try to stay in in this business
because he's fucked so many people over I
[SPEAKER_02]: hooked up one Kenobi with the with the
s420 original diesel the shroomy 420 now
[SPEAKER_02]: shroomy I wish I would have I should have
kept this I have a picture of him he's a
[SPEAKER_02]: sex predator pop for fucking little kids
so shroomy is not the most reliable source
[SPEAKER_02]: but I mean just because you fuck little
kids doesn't mean that you fucking back
[SPEAKER_02]: door farmer it doesn't mean that you know
you can't be trusted on clones but I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: like kid fuckers so fucks shroomy right
all right last year this is a shapeshifter
[SPEAKER_02]: January 19 2010 yeah that part fucking
sucks but what are you gonna do last year
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush corner used to vend a record the
double dog snow dog cat piss unfortunately
[SPEAKER_02]: they were shut down otherwise everyone
else has that 707 good bit different don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what that means mmm then we get down
to let's see where's the where's the loop
[SPEAKER_02]: apart let's go answer some loop of
questions there it is NKK hills let's see
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's let's see where we're at here
so this is some of the other stuff let's
[SPEAKER_02]: see swerve there's swerve there there's
the quote so you guys know I'm not just
[SPEAKER_02]: putting it out I mean these are his words
not mine fucking turd let's see where are
[SPEAKER_02]: we at here shapeshifter there's the Kush
corner quote huh that guy was a fraud
[SPEAKER_02]: swerve calling someone else a fraud don't
be lost come back you'll be okay Moda
[SPEAKER_02]: militia spelled terribly Loompa's headband
is the is it the same there's a question
[SPEAKER_02]: so now we go back to the Moda militia
Loompa's headband now if if we conclude
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's no reason to conclude this
other than Jason King that diesel number
[SPEAKER_02]: one is the same as original diesel is the
same as day wrecker is the same as
[SPEAKER_02]: headband etc where does Loompa's headband
fit in I'll go back to the JJ response so
[SPEAKER_02]: basically he just repeats what someone
else said no Loompa's headband was not
[SPEAKER_02]: sourced and it was not sourced in a way
that can be provenance Loompa's said a few
[SPEAKER_02]: different things he said that it was
stolen from a place in New York smuggling
[SPEAKER_02]: in someone's pocket to him right he puts
it back I forgot what Yuri said but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: something he said it was the very first OG
Kush to show up on the boards which is
[SPEAKER_02]: very incorrect it is an OG Kush it's it's
got some sour traits to it but is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely an OG Kush it is nothing
related to the old original diesel yes
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah inspect to use the Loompa's headband
which is the correct term for it only
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's not headband it's not the
original headband but yeah that's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the best lines that I've run of the
Loompa's headband crosses is the Urkel
[SPEAKER_02]: underdog that shits bomb and then they
move this over it jumps over to what is
[SPEAKER_02]: this it's a double underdog why anybody's
talking about double underdog other than
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that it has underdog in the name
I'm not sure it's obviously not original
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel it is a seed line and then there's
a person named dub wobble let me find this
[SPEAKER_02]: one dub wobble let's get to the dub wobble
part there's the double underdog swerve
[SPEAKER_02]: double underdog where's dub wobble should
be right about here yeah I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's any seeds of pure headband at
least I've never seen them I've had a cut
[SPEAKER_02]: of headband for five years now it is it is
not OG it is not chem dog D is not sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel it is way closer to sour diesel
than OG in characteristics I have been I
[SPEAKER_02]: have seen the so-called OG phenotype I
believe that someone got their cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: mislabeled or actually growing OG the
structure just isn't the same as the
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel type headband so that's again a
little bit more clarity from someone that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of knows what they're talking about
that has had the original diesel cut but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really hard to figure out and real
headband is not OG again not OG different
[SPEAKER_02]: different area of the country wasn't
called headband at the time it's not OG
[SPEAKER_02]: and then dub wobble says the 707 is not
headband at least not what harbor side or
[SPEAKER_02]: blue sky passes out by the way for every
everyone that PMs about trading I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: able to PBM back blah blah blah and then
we have venom coming back in yes the 707
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts definitely bomb but I don't consider
it real headband and then we go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Schmo's double underdog cut for a
while gotta keep scrolling down because
[SPEAKER_02]: people are still talking about that and
then someone bringing up underdog number
[SPEAKER_02]: one and then green thumb Danny now green
dumb green dumb Fanny is a better name for
[SPEAKER_02]: him he does consider himself quite an
authority and a lot of people consider him
[SPEAKER_02]: quite an authority on this site for some
reason I'm not sure why and then it's him
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about again double underdog and
Joe's cut throwing balls and then he calls
[SPEAKER_02]: someone porch monkey but I think that was
their name yeah they every every single
[SPEAKER_02]: subject no one takes it back to the hey
wait a minute aren't we talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking original diesel here how the fuck
did we get to all these other topics let's
[SPEAKER_02]: see let's see that that that that I'm
trying to find the next part we have
[SPEAKER_02]: cowabunga Ron to confuse it up even more
see Empress firestars and candy Kush big L
[SPEAKER_02]: don't you have some of those beans already
I seen you write that another thread just
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering man I would have popped those
immediately so what he's referring to
[SPEAKER_02]: Empress firestarters candy Kush candy Kush
is another name for the candy cut really
[SPEAKER_02]: is another name for Loomis headband
Empress was a candy Loomis headband yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's nothing here nor there trying to
find if there's anything else to reference
[SPEAKER_02]: in here real quick and then we'll move on
to the next the next quote we have power
[SPEAKER_02]: og showing up he was a fucking retard
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and it's hard for people to do this
research that go on that have these
[SPEAKER_02]: questions that need these answers and they
don't know who these characters are
[SPEAKER_02]: characters are and how well they can be
trusted and this is a shining example of
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to go through this thread
navigate it as best you can and see if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can find the answers and by the end of it
we have power og talking about more Loomis
[SPEAKER_02]: headband and yeti and how we got it from
the man and it's the real deal and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: where it ends so let's go to the next one
where's the net where's my next one this
[SPEAKER_02]: is my favorite my personal fave right back
it up back it up where's out here they are
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I gotta find the original post
though let's see no that's not it that's
[SPEAKER_02]: IC mag what about this one there we go so
this is what this is what this is what on
[SPEAKER_02]: th farm original sour diesel cutting so
what looking up original diesel this is
[SPEAKER_02]: where I fucking keep ending up right sour
diesel shit like that this is started by
[SPEAKER_02]: th gobs my old buddy th gobs right yeah
dude skunk fiat that's exactly kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what I was I was I was getting to is like
man people have all these questions and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like dude go do some research go do
some fucking research and then I realize
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what I send them to anyway th gobs
original sour diesel now this guy is also
[SPEAKER_02]: known as NYC kid this is my cotex best
friend this is the guy passing the Asian
[SPEAKER_02]: fantasy cut and the blue Asian fantasy cut
this is his original sour diesel clone
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you guys think pretty fucking
pretty sick huh pretty sick for a sour
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some more shots whoa look at that
sour sour anyway oddly enough everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: blasts him on the thread and he never says
another thing again it's one of the few
[SPEAKER_02]: times where I'm like wow everybody didn't
just buy into it and go fuck that's dank
[SPEAKER_02]: that's fucking awesome so let's move on to
let's move that this is this is actually a
[SPEAKER_02]: really good guess if that plant is a clone
only my guess would be aft gooey I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't say blue dream that doesn't look
like blue dream to me aft gooey is even a
[SPEAKER_02]: stretch but it's it's a better guess than
sour all right and here's here's pictures
[SPEAKER_02]: of ECSD there you go there's sour anyway
so let's move it over to IC mag because at
[SPEAKER_02]: that point that's what you got you know so
here we go original diesel hello
[SPEAKER_02]: connoisseur this is OJD he's referring to
in John Hoover I was just wondering if
[SPEAKER_02]: there are any pictures of original diesel
that you use is it the same as underdog
[SPEAKER_02]: day wrecker etc now these guys are over in
in England and and what a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know and they take for granted I
think is the fact that these guys it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard to get clones over the pond
even still it's still really hard to get
[SPEAKER_02]: clones over the pond so a lot of times are
only using seed lines and and so nowhere
[SPEAKER_02]: know where things are being made know who
is making them and you'll have a better
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of whether it's legit or not just
it's it's it helps you break down the
[SPEAKER_02]: process of whether these guys are gonna
have legit shit or not so going and
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing American clones over from British
breeders probably isn't gonna be your best
[SPEAKER_02]: bet anyway so this guy's asking him hey is
this is this the same as the American
[SPEAKER_02]: original diesel I mean it should be you're
calling it original diesel right you're
[SPEAKER_02]: calling it underdog and day wrecker right
all right so next let's see where was I
[SPEAKER_02]: boom oh JD hi bro I don't think it's exact
same cut as you posted I don't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures handy but I'll try to dig one up
later and post it yeah well here's the
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures John Hoover chimes in here are
some shots of the original diesel OJD uses
[SPEAKER_02]: this was sourced by DNA genetics and was
passed out to our friends because verified
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the real deal original diesel by the
big dogs in the game DNA being the big
[SPEAKER_02]: dogs here you go here's some shots not
sure what it is but they put up plenty
[SPEAKER_02]: shots a something I'm guessing it's some
res work it looks like super sour silver
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel haze to me that's what I would
assume it is not sure I mean granted they
[SPEAKER_02]: grow shittily so it's hard to tell but
it's definitely not it and here's just the
[SPEAKER_02]: the typical picture results when you look
up original diesel right none of none of
[SPEAKER_02]: which are it closest one is that middle
one that looks a little similar to it but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a little more bulky in structure
looks a lot more like it looks a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: like diesel machine picture of diesel do
do do do do let's see just for
[SPEAKER_02]: illustration purposes what's a good diesel
picture like that there you go that's like
[SPEAKER_02]: a diesel I think it's a G less one but
here's a diesel picture that's that's much
[SPEAKER_02]: more what you expect and it's more mimics
the original diesel look so yeah overall
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what happens when you use you
search this shit out and as you see there
[SPEAKER_02]: were many people that chimed in that have
respect in our community that are Raiders
[SPEAKER_02]: that are his cannabis historians and and
and putting their input on it and you see
[SPEAKER_02]: and granted you know what a lot of those
come out in the past 10 years about these
[SPEAKER_02]: these lines what they are what they aren't
and so you can't hold it against them
[SPEAKER_02]: they're trying to use what info they had
at that point but you can hold it against
[SPEAKER_02]: swerve because he's a fucking retard you
can hold it against green thumb Danny
[SPEAKER_02]: because he's a fucking retard and they're
speaking in in facts and and like this is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely this this is definitely that
doesn't gauge green work with the day
[SPEAKER_02]: record cut who fucking knows that he's
working with he probably sourced it from
[SPEAKER_02]: dusty bowls would be my guess backyard
back door farmer Danimal that dude I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: try to leave it up for viewing I don't I
have a hard time saving these after I do
[SPEAKER_02]: them so they need to be uploaded to
YouTube and stuff so if one of you wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that and and pass me the file I'll
be happy to put it up weasel story I know
[SPEAKER_02]: weasel cross sensei northern lights to a
diesel chem 91 this became the underdog AJ
[SPEAKER_02]: then renamed underdog to headband well we
have some issues with that too we have
[SPEAKER_02]: some issues with that too because JJ New
York has also said that he named it
[SPEAKER_02]: headband we don't know who named it
headband AJ and JJ are very good friends
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not calling either one of them a liar
one of them probably did maybe maybe but
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not sure which because they both
take the claim to it all right let me see
[SPEAKER_02]: what I miss now the Exodus cheese cut came
skunk one seed pack in 80s that is correct
[SPEAKER_02]: germinator 2 and it did I miss something
earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't come from a collective in Luton and
Milo didn't put it out in the racing not
[SPEAKER_02]: fax at all yeah it came from skunk one so
like that day record I talked to JJ years
[SPEAKER_02]: back said he lost it way back never gave a
clone out neither said it was extinct
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what I've heard too you know but
pretty much everybody says everything's
[SPEAKER_02]: extinct that they no longer have access to
in that little circle so it's hard to say
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I've seen chem dog refer to
headband in his own stuff and then I've
[SPEAKER_02]: heard I've seen chem dog also say that
he's never run headband but it's usually
[SPEAKER_02]: other people referring to chem dog having
headband as opposed to chem saying he ran
[SPEAKER_02]: headband so that's a hard one what else
was there the extinct mass super skunk I
[SPEAKER_02]: found a picture of it last night
supposedly it's supposed to be the best
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus supposed to be the best
representation of mass skunk but I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: some pictures last night and I was like
wow that doesn't really look like anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that I remember seeing anything close yeah
I'm not sure why headband and day record
[SPEAKER_02]: got stuck together other than the can of
Bible and people fucking read that book
[SPEAKER_02]: and they stick to it religiously
religiously anything said in the can of
[SPEAKER_02]: Bibles got to be true and it just so many
things have been proven to be incorrect in
[SPEAKER_02]: that in that book and again it was a long
time before there was a lot of info out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and a lot of these guys were talking
so they were probably trying to make best
[SPEAKER_02]: do with what they could but Jason King had
some good access to people so he you know
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah G ran supposedly ran the diesel now
the one thing when researching when
[SPEAKER_02]: researching diesel the one thing after
talking to all the dudes involved is that
[SPEAKER_02]: no one on the diesel side from the New
York side says that they for sure had the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem 91 what it turned out to look like
was that they have chem 91 bag seed and
[SPEAKER_02]: that was what was used to then call diesel
so it would have been a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different than chem 91 bearded I don't
yeah I don't know that's what the that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what the source says up there about old
dr. underground let's see I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: that he claimed it but he's the first
person that comes up for having created it
[SPEAKER_02]: so someone say diesel a lot I'm trying to
find some this mask gunk picture now this
[SPEAKER_02]: the picture I'm looking for was taken from
chem dogs room and was shown in high times
[SPEAKER_02]: of it damn too many fucking pictures of
bullshit on here
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah that's the best we could tell
it's either it's either a bag seed of chem
[SPEAKER_02]: 91 or chem 91 that was called diesel I
would believe the bag seed story that's
[SPEAKER_02]: more likely to have happened as opposed to
the cut just being passed yeah it's hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to say so overall what the answer ends up
being is who fucking knows I got nothing I
[SPEAKER_02]: got no answer going through all that
bullshit not a single answer worth going
[SPEAKER_02]: over there's the mask gunk that's supposed
to be the mass super aka the Virginia
[SPEAKER_02]: super skunk skunk fee does that look like
the the Virginia super skunk I know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a shitty picture I mean try to
swap it there we go you can kind of see it
[SPEAKER_02]: up in the corner hopefully it's not too
small
[SPEAKER_02]: there it is up in that corner it's really
airy I don't know if it's just that yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not the best grow of it so it's
really hard to say it has similar leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: to the diesel but goddamn it's it's pretty
airy so yeah it's hard to say this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: this is from Greg's room I believe mystery
seed from the chem D I don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: that was it does look like it was hating
life doesn't it these are all the other
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures I don't know who's ringing my
doorbell right now Kim sister lay down
[SPEAKER_02]: Murray lay down lay down
[SPEAKER_02]: oh Murray get over here get over here
anyway yeah that was uh that's what I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to run through it was a fun trip
down memory lane going through fucking old
[SPEAKER_02]: the big dogs they're coming for me the big
dogs like what the fuck this fucking guy
[SPEAKER_02]: just gave away all our secrets I think it
is gunk yeah I think it's around 2005 when
[SPEAKER_02]: you when you can't explain the difference
between all 14 real Kim D plants being
[SPEAKER_02]: passed around yeah that's a rough one
let's go see who's at the door because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sure Brynn didn't hear that let's go see
stay what if it's the dancing habibi
[SPEAKER_02]: oh it's the the cartel lady lovely
something to do with the box sure Brynn
[SPEAKER_02]: loves talking to her anyway anyway anyway
back to what we were doing oh swear is
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna threaten to quit the business you
guys don't have enough respect for me I
[SPEAKER_02]: might be able to even post it again I
don't want to dig all the way back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of my shit but I thought I took
a screenshot of it and made a smiley face
[SPEAKER_02]: on his nipples for him I did there you go
guys there you go that's swerve who is
[SPEAKER_02]: swerve that's swerve
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna keep sitting here clapping
notice the kids toy in the background
[SPEAKER_02]: that's my favorite that's my favorite
almost as good as that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: oh lord don't have so much that what was
that about yeah I know what do they want
[SPEAKER_00]: oh no we don't have your quinceanera
flowers ma'am here give me I want to see
[SPEAKER_02]: what they are oh it's your books anyway
[SPEAKER_02]: there you go there you go anyway um yeah
so that was that was our buddy swerve I
[SPEAKER_02]: had to bring it back up cuz he he's a
fucking asshole and he you know whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway so the whole point of this was to
show like I've kind of been a dick like
[SPEAKER_02]: when I tell people go research it man why
aren't you fucking researching it why are
[SPEAKER_02]: you asking me why don't you go fucking
research it like when I start snapping on
[SPEAKER_02]: people I'm sorry some shit you just can't
research it's not there the answers aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: there you have to go to the root the the
the root of the sources you know you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to go back you got to talk to the clops
the the weasels you know I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend talking to AJ you're not gonna
get the same answer twice you have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: back and talk to these guys don't bug
skunk fa though because you don't like
[SPEAKER_02]: being bugged just kidding no don't go
don't go be impolite in asking this don't
[SPEAKER_02]: expect stuff but you know be respectful
when you're asking and that and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole thing there was no answer to the
original diesel what what this cut is
[SPEAKER_02]: where it came from is it the day wrecker
is it the original diesel number one I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't think it is because I remember
everybody saying that the original diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: number one including Vondo said this that
it died very early on is it headband
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not headband seems to be a
different cut than the original diesel I
[SPEAKER_02]: just I'm guessing that's not the same
thing and it's not the same cut that I see
[SPEAKER_02]: collective and the elite crew have his
headband so I wanted to break that down if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's any other any other strange you
guys want me to research and do this on
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do that in the future we could do
this once I don't know this is pain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ass but you know every few weeks love you
duker love you skunk yeah it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: confusing and it and it is absolutely
confusing being in the middle of it back
[SPEAKER_02]: then and just shaking your head like god
these guys don't know fucking shit why
[SPEAKER_02]: people keep asking him shit and in the end
yet goes to show they don't know shit
[SPEAKER_02]: what's that what oh my god I would have
fucking killed let me see it so I just got
[SPEAKER_02]: this we just got this I think there's two
of them in here they're acid blotter
[SPEAKER_02]: papers you can see it's actually real acid
blotter paper too from Luke to I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: is how you pronounce it the artist no it's
actually pronounced to you but yeah these
[SPEAKER_02]: are these are pretty fucking cool and the
cartel just got delivered them instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: our fucking house again are you ever going
to make Panama red shirts they are up and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're already for sale cannabis
carnivore they're over on skunktech.com
[SPEAKER_02]: see see it's even got certificate
authenticity a little Luke signature but
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I think it's fucking rad when an
artist goes out of the way to make acid
[SPEAKER_02]: blotter fucking art that's fucking cool
I'm really stoked about those as you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see on the back it is really meant to be
used for that but I don't know if I can
[SPEAKER_02]: these are a little expensive to be using
for that anyway yeah I would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: pissed if they delivered this somewhere
else fucking pissed idiots alright so any
[SPEAKER_02]: any of and when I say these guys are
cartel I'm not fucking kidding I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not an example of being racist or
anything they are fucking cartel we have
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican cartel here pretty fucking heavy
family motors stuff like that is all
[SPEAKER_02]: cartel owned so yeah they live right next
to us and they are not nice I went up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the dude because he was dogging you after
we first moved in he was just like sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: there fucking dogging me and Brynn and his
wife was dogging Brynn and I was like okay
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I'm not gonna put up with that
shit so I walked over there and I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really see anything I just kind of walked
like I was fucking pissed and I went over
[SPEAKER_02]: there and they kind of look you know kind
of like this fucking white guy doing and
[SPEAKER_02]: then he says hey I was like hey what's up
my name is Matt and he's like they call me
[SPEAKER_02]: poncho and I was like yep I bet they do
yeah I know I saw I heard yeah was she
[SPEAKER_02]: nice yeah yeah good yeah fucking weirdos
yeah 20 people living in a two-story
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so if you guys have any questions go
ahead and start shooting them I can answer
[SPEAKER_02]: questions now we can break this down what
[SPEAKER_02]: oh Harry Harry J all-stars did that reggae
track it's called liquidator oh I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know if Duke seen my tattoo I don't think
so I have a black hand tattoo
[SPEAKER_02]: the vagabond Inn in Bakersfield ooh we
also have the Villa Inn and it just like
[SPEAKER_02]: it looks like Dylan Duke it says Duke gets
around apparently yeah Duke you shady
[SPEAKER_02]: what's up straight yeah G's was one of my
favorites by far artist in Leach's work
[SPEAKER_02]: the artist I'll type it out yeah Luke Chua
but it's pronounced you and you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: him at there you go I think they still
have one of these left on 1xrun.com the
[SPEAKER_02]: other one sold out there's only a hundred
made of each so
[SPEAKER_02]: he knows about the vagabond Inn yeah nope
I alone some I'm I'm gonna bring you on so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can tell us all about the Kim D's is
Hefe totally sad that I bumped him from
[SPEAKER_01]: here for being an asshole how or why he's
always a dick that's what he gets I know
[SPEAKER_02]: right Kim Valley need the Kim Valley Kim
Valley D the worst shop in Baco oh god all
[SPEAKER_02]: of them they're all bad weasel store in
sour D apparently multiple sour D cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: weasel across the male underdog to mask up
okay so there there's a debate on what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened with the sour diesel whether it's
the our diesel half it would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: nice to have had Hefe fucking in here to
answer the the our diesel the from Vondo's
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking point of view because he knows the
the story from Vondo better than most they
[SPEAKER_02]: had the the bag seeds of whatever the
diesel in a bag that said our diesel and
[SPEAKER_02]: that became the sour diesel that's the
story from from Vondo and that's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: Hefe's friends but he had to act like a
jackass so he's not in here to fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: answer that dummy how did you describe the
differences in smell and color growth
[SPEAKER_02]: between Kim DVA that's a long question to
answer on here buddy so weasel and AJ
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know what Albany crew did with mass
skunk diesel and L to make sour D I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know I was trying to focus Hefe was acting
like a jackass Hefe didn't want me doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this and I'm not sure why Hefe didn't want
me doing this maybe just wanted attention
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure but yeah there was a a really
after the Adam Dunn show weasel did
[SPEAKER_02]: another podcast and it was a bunch of info
contrary to the original podcast and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: really been trying to find it but I can't
because there might be some answers
[SPEAKER_02]: between both of them and what was
consistent right but I can't find that one
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a really hard time finding that
ever hear of a strain by gooey AAA death I
[SPEAKER_02]: have not but I'm not proficient in gooey's
work where's the pink Death Star it's up
[SPEAKER_02]: in Canada Canadians run the shit out of
that miss Jill purple Afghani any ETA miss
[SPEAKER_02]: Jill any ETA on the purple Afghani that is
a beautiful cut you guys 707 seed bank cat
[SPEAKER_02]: piss I believe it's the the Pittsburgh
piss NorCal cat piss that's about the most
[SPEAKER_02]: I know about it any truth to cat piss
there's so many different cat pisses it's
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like Chem D 90 of them yeah there
there are so many different ones so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to say maybe time warp was one
of them but you can get it from an Afghan
[SPEAKER_02]: haze that typically spits out those
ammonia piss turps my buddy in Canada lame
[SPEAKER_02]: game on flame he knows where to get lots
of pink Death Star he's been showing me
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of pink Death Star death star fucking
extracts and bud and all kinds of shit are
[SPEAKER_02]: they all related I'm not sure if I don't
think all the chem D's are related for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure cat piss I doubt all the cat pisses
are related yeah super silver haze you can
[SPEAKER_02]: find it in that another Afghan haze combo
yeah Ziggy is awesome I love that dude
[SPEAKER_02]: he's a hell of a guy plus he's a he's a
little punk rocker gotta love it
[SPEAKER_02]: Jill gonna do a reversal she's handling it
handling her shit look at that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what what Danali missed you bud yeah
yeah I don't know you'll figure it and
[SPEAKER_02]: Danali said missed you too see there you
go you got your answer all right what are
[SPEAKER_02]: the questions you guys got how those blue
bonnets from Texas kid turning out from
[SPEAKER_02]: Lone Star Lone Star didn't Lone Star make
that shit see I had a picture somewhere I
[SPEAKER_02]: was illustrating because I have all my
males in a in a tray together they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of in small pots but he was standing
out so much the the selected blue bonnet
[SPEAKER_02]: male hold on let's see if I can find him
he kept standing out in a crowd of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything and it was it was pretty
amazing let's see is that it no that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: it now I've got fucking liquidator in my
head yeah I had a picture of it but like
[SPEAKER_02]: he in the midst of all the let's see how
do we do this the code is pre pre 420
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you the 35% off right now of
everything but the spray it's pre pre 420
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it he was standing with his his
family is like this almost at 90 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: straight up like it was pretty crazy in
the middle of everything so and his stocks
[SPEAKER_02]: like this thick yay thick in a in a tiny
little bigger than a solo cup but it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: square pot oh whoa and he's super tall so
he made himself stand out so I'm doing
[SPEAKER_02]: some a four-way a four-way the the Fairfax
four-way cross to the blue bonnet some Mac
[SPEAKER_02]: blue bonnet just to see what that or that
takes it cuz I don't like Mac turps Jesus
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I don't know what's up I'm
all day can I find any roadkill skunk in
[SPEAKER_02]: your other lines aside from the heirloom
Afghani there's still heirloom Afghani
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids that I have that you can find you
can find skunk spray some people call
[SPEAKER_02]: roadkill skunk different things I just
when I think of roadkill skunk I think of
[SPEAKER_02]: a skunk being run over you know what I
mean like that's that's a smell you can
[SPEAKER_02]: smell that fucking half a mile away so
yeah you that that kind of stuff's in
[SPEAKER_02]: there what is the trip fucking trip with
copycat genetics what a sweet web page
[SPEAKER_02]: never seen so many frosted s1s even a
archaist to boot copycats a fraud dude
[SPEAKER_02]: that dude's a fraud he released s1s and
they were all red lines so stay away from
[SPEAKER_02]: it we're gonna be having an even bigger
sale on 420 but that's always a way but
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll have a really big sale I'm gonna put
out a bunch of stuff that's never been
[SPEAKER_02]: released and it's only gonna be one or two
