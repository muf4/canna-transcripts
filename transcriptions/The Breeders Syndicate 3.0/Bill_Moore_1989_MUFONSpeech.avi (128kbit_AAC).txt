[SPEAKER_27]: A little rough from time to time,
so if I offend, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_27]: But unfortunately, that's the way I am.
[SPEAKER_27]: First of all, before I begin, I would like
to thank very much Mr. John Lear for
[SPEAKER_27]: making it possible for me to be here at
this conference.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did not know whether or not I would be
able to make it, and John made that
[SPEAKER_27]: possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: And he has my deepest gratitude because
I've been looking forward for an
[SPEAKER_27]: opportunity like this for almost 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_27]: And also I'd like to thank the other
speakers who very graciously donated some
[SPEAKER_27]: of their time to allow me to speak.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have 45 minutes, and in 45 minutes I
have to condense 12 years of information
[SPEAKER_27]: and happenings.
[SPEAKER_27]: What I would like to do is speak for 30
minutes and then for 15 minutes accept
[SPEAKER_27]: questions from the floor.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'd like to make a promise to you at
this point that unlike certain people,
[SPEAKER_27]: I will not try to treat you like mushrooms
by keeping you in the dark and feeding you
[SPEAKER_27]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that during the question and answer
period, I will not ask myself questions
[SPEAKER_27]: and answer them.
[SPEAKER_27]: Give you a little background about myself.
[SPEAKER_27]: In 1976, while working for the United
States government at RAF Chick-Sands,
[SPEAKER_27]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_27]: Air Force Base Security Services Command
in Bedford, England, as a data analyst,
[SPEAKER_27]: I had the occasion to view a document
entitled Grudge Blue Book Report Number
[SPEAKER_27]: 13.
[SPEAKER_27]: Those of you who are aware of the history
of Blue Book, know that Grudge Blue Book
[SPEAKER_27]: or Blue Book Report Number 13 is a
document that the government has sworn for
[SPEAKER_27]: years does not exist.
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I'm here to tell you, ladies and
gentlemen, that's crap.
[SPEAKER_27]: It does exist.
[SPEAKER_27]: While employed by the government and
fulfilling my duties, I analyzed that
[SPEAKER_27]: document.
[SPEAKER_27]: I read it very carefully.
[SPEAKER_27]: Over 600 pages, over half of it,
half of that was photographs.
[SPEAKER_27]: The content of that document consisted
largely of technical reports, autopsy
[SPEAKER_27]: reports, and photographs of alien beings,
alien technology, and unsundry other
[SPEAKER_27]: things, which I will get into.
[SPEAKER_27]: And at this point, I would like to make
mention that I find myself in a very poor
[SPEAKER_27]: position, which I am not entirely happy
with because I'm being forced to do
[SPEAKER_27]: something I swore up and down I would
never do, and that is respond to last
[SPEAKER_27]: night's speaker, Mr. Bill Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I will do that after I give you a
brief rundown of the Blue Book 13 report.
[SPEAKER_27]: The version of the document that I saw was
an annotated version.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Cooper saw his version of the document
in the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_27]: I saw my version of the same document in
the mid 70s.
[SPEAKER_27]: My version of the document had been
expanded considerably.
[SPEAKER_27]: A large portion of the document consisted
largely of photographs, photographs which
[SPEAKER_27]: showed alien beings alive and dead.
[SPEAKER_27]: Micro photography photographs of two issue
samples, lab reports of fluid samples,
[SPEAKER_27]: analytical data from the findings of
tests, technical data concerning craft,
[SPEAKER_27]: power units, and possibly weapons.
[SPEAKER_27]: The general tone of the document itself
was geared basically toward defense.
[SPEAKER_27]: How would we defend against something like
this?
[SPEAKER_27]: How would we defend against the technology
that was obvious and that was shown and
[SPEAKER_27]: reported upon in the document?
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, for the past 12 years, eight of which
I was in hiding, I have been called a
[SPEAKER_27]: liar, I have been called a drug addict,
a pervert, a psychotic, you name it,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I've been called it.
[SPEAKER_27]: According to some, I am probably the most
perverted son of a bitch you will meet in
[SPEAKER_27]: the entire world.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_27]: After 12 years, I've become a little bit
hard-shelled about the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I don't particularly care.
[SPEAKER_27]: But there's something we have to
understand.
[SPEAKER_27]: As a group of investigators, as a group of
interested people, we have to cut through
[SPEAKER_27]: the crap.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to pull together as a unified
force and forget personalities,
[SPEAKER_27]: forget character assassination,
forget all of the politics that exist
[SPEAKER_27]: within organizations, and unite in order
to find the answers that we need to find.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to do this.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's imperative.
[SPEAKER_27]: Part of our problem right now is we don't
even know what the questions are.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to cooperate with one another.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of you have read John Lear's
interview with me in Virginia of last year
[SPEAKER_27]: in which he outlined much of what I've
been saying for the past 12 years.
[SPEAKER_27]: I would suggest that you get a copy of
this if you do not have it and read it.
[SPEAKER_27]: The simple fact of the matter is,
is I can't tell you any more than has
[SPEAKER_27]: already been published in things like UFO
Crash at Aztec by Bill Steinman and
[SPEAKER_27]: Wendell Stevens, or what has been
published by John Lear.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_27]: And most of you, I'm sure, have touched
upon the report or read the report and
[SPEAKER_27]: what was in the report.
[SPEAKER_27]: Unfortunately, I'm faced with a dilemma at
this point, and that dilemma is this.
[SPEAKER_27]: I came here last night to listen to Mr.
Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I came here with the idea of being
open-minded as I possibly could,
[SPEAKER_27]: understanding that people are entitled to
their own opinion, their own feeling,
[SPEAKER_27]: for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_27]: But there's a part of me that objects very
strongly to being lied to.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's exactly what happened last
night.
[SPEAKER_27]: You were lied to.
[SPEAKER_27]: We sat up here in the audience and
listened to a man expound on stuff that
[SPEAKER_27]: was absolute utter hogwash.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, some of you are sitting out there
saying, how can this be true?
[SPEAKER_27]: Why is it hogwash?
[SPEAKER_27]: He's a respected investor.
[SPEAKER_27]: Investigator.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's been in the business for a long time.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's published a book.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's published a couple of books.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, he has.
[SPEAKER_27]: His Roswell Incident set new precedents
for investigation in the UFO field,
[SPEAKER_27]: and he's to be commended for it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I admire him for it.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an excellent book.
[SPEAKER_27]: He broke new ground for UFO investigators.
[SPEAKER_27]: What happened after that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_27]: You heard Mr. Moore stand up here and say
in 1980 or 1981, he was approached and
[SPEAKER_27]: given information by Falcon or Condor or
whatever the buzzard's name was.
[SPEAKER_27]: That was a lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was an absolute lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know it was a lie because in 1970,
1979, one month after Mr. Moore arrived in
[SPEAKER_27]: the state of Arizona, thanks to Mr. Alan
Benz, formerly of APRO, now for the
[SPEAKER_27]: Foundation of UFO Research, Mr. Moore and
I met, at which point I related my
[SPEAKER_27]: information to Mr. Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: We met not once, but twice.
[SPEAKER_27]: Several months later, Mr. Moore came to
me.
[SPEAKER_27]: At my place of business, a little place
called Trail Dust Town off Tanker Verde
[SPEAKER_27]: Road in Tucson, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_27]: We went across the street to a little
place called the Parfait Palace.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had a bowl of chili.
[SPEAKER_27]: He had a cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had heartburn, and he had brain burn.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Moore sat there for two hours,
and we conversed.
[SPEAKER_27]: We discussed.
[SPEAKER_27]: What I had related to him to begin with in
the Blue Book documents, and I think,
[SPEAKER_27]: ostensibly, what he was trying to do was
to see if he could catch me at a lie,
[SPEAKER_27]: see if I would tell him the same thing I
told him before, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_27]: Any good investigator would do that.
[SPEAKER_27]: But somewhere along the line, Mr. Moore
twisted it around.
[SPEAKER_27]: At that time, I had been discussing with
Mr. Jerry Schultz, who had been passing
[SPEAKER_27]: through APRO, and apparently had been
passing through APRO for several years at
[SPEAKER_27]: that point, with his bicycle and his
little pup tent, some of the implications
[SPEAKER_27]: of what had been going on.
[SPEAKER_27]: Quite literally, whenever I was in the
APRO office, Mr. Schultz was in the APRO
[SPEAKER_27]: office, and he grilled me extensively.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Moore asked my opinion of Mr. Schultz.
[SPEAKER_27]: At that time, being fairly conservative,
and not as liberal as I am these days,
[SPEAKER_27]: I expressed the opinion that I thought Mr.
Schultz was a bit different.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Moore brought up the question of
drugs.
[SPEAKER_27]: To which I responded, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything's possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did not know the man well.
[SPEAKER_27]: I never did know the man well,
contrary to what you might have heard from
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Schultz himself.
[SPEAKER_27]: We were never close, never have been
close.
[SPEAKER_27]: Very shortly after that, due to
circumstances which got a little bit out
[SPEAKER_27]: of control with regard to my activity and
investigation, and the fact that very
[SPEAKER_27]: suddenly there were serious attempts
against my life, it became appropriate for
[SPEAKER_27]: me to disappear, at which point I went
into hiding for eight years.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yesterday marked the first anniversary of
me resurfacing into the UFO investigative
[SPEAKER_27]: community.
[SPEAKER_27]: Today marks the 13th anniversary of my
viewing of the Grudge Blue Book Report
[SPEAKER_27]: Number 13.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thirteen years ago today, in 1976,
I viewed that document, and my life went
[SPEAKER_27]: to hell in a hand card.
[SPEAKER_27]: As a result of viewing that document,
as I digress a little bit, I lost a wife
[SPEAKER_27]: and two kids.
[SPEAKER_27]: I reported to work, as I normally do,
at Security Services Command at R.I.F.
[SPEAKER_27]: Chick Sands.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was immediately told to report to the
base commander's office on base,
[SPEAKER_27]: which I did.
[SPEAKER_27]: Where I met Colonel Robert Black,
then base commander at R.I.F.
[SPEAKER_27]: Chick Sands.
[SPEAKER_27]: Colonel Black called me into his office
and informed me that I was being
[SPEAKER_27]: discharged from my job, and that I was
being deported from the country as
[SPEAKER_27]: undesirable element.
[SPEAKER_27]: No explanation, no reason, that was it.
[SPEAKER_27]: It took me several days to recover.
[SPEAKER_27]: It took me several months after my return
to the United States to finally determine
[SPEAKER_27]: what had happened.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was not allowed to say goodbye to my
wife or children who remained in England,
[SPEAKER_27]: who remained at R.I.F.
[SPEAKER_27]: Chick Sands for another five years,
where she taught school, at the R.I.F.
[SPEAKER_27]: Chick Sands Dependent School.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have not seen my wife and sons in 12
years.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have not heard from them in two years.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have discovered ultimately that she was
transferred to another Air Force base in
[SPEAKER_27]: England, where she teaches school still.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was not allowed to communicate with her
in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was not allowed to tell her what was
going on, why it was going on.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did discover later that she had been
told that I'd just walked in and quit,
[SPEAKER_27]: and left the country, and left her.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_25]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not true, but that's what she was
told.
[SPEAKER_27]: And any woman in her right mind who's left
high and dry with two kids to take care of
[SPEAKER_27]: is going to think the worst.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_27]: Ultimately, after about 10 years,
I divorced my wife, feeling that there was
[SPEAKER_27]: no way I could possibly salvage a
marriage, and that after such a long
[SPEAKER_27]: separation, she had changed and I had
changed, and I decided it was time to get
[SPEAKER_27]: on with my life.
[SPEAKER_27]: Ultimately, two years ago, I married a
very wonderful lady with two kids of her
[SPEAKER_27]: own.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm quite happy, and it looks like this
marriage will last a long time.
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope it will, because she's about the
only person I know that can put up with my
[SPEAKER_27]: shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_27]: She deserves a lot of credit, and I'd like
you to know that she supports me,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I wouldn't be able to do what I'm
doing today without her support.
[SPEAKER_27]: During the last 12 years, there have been
over 50 or 15 attempts on my life.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have been shot at.
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been stabbed.
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been blown up.
[SPEAKER_27]: I've contracted food poisoning.
[SPEAKER_27]: All the little things that are geared to
look like nice little accidents.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, some of you will say, well,
if you were in such a secure position
[SPEAKER_27]: while you were hiding, why did you come
back out?
[SPEAKER_27]: I was employed at a radio station in
Lynchburg, Virginia, WLPA Stereo 59.
[SPEAKER_27]: By this time, John Lear had tried to
contact my father.
[SPEAKER_27]: My father is William J.
[SPEAKER_27]: English, Speaker of the House of
Representatives for the State of Arizona.
[SPEAKER_27]: My father, being somewhat aware of my
decision, my desire to maintain my
[SPEAKER_27]: anonymity, denied my existence to John.
[SPEAKER_27]: Had his secretary deny my existence.
[SPEAKER_27]: And John, bless his heart, persisted.
[SPEAKER_27]: Persisted to the point where my father's
secretary was so worked up and so upset,
[SPEAKER_27]: my father decided to forward John's phone
number in a terse little note saying that
[SPEAKER_27]: he did not tell John where I was at or how
to get in contact with me and I damn well
[SPEAKER_27]: better take care of it because he was
getting tired of it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I learned a long time ago, it's not wise
to cross my father.
[SPEAKER_27]: He has a nasty habit of getting what he
wants.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I didn't respond to it immediately for
two reasons.
[SPEAKER_27]: One, I did not know John Lear.
[SPEAKER_27]: And two, I really didn't feel that it was
necessary at that point for me to come out
[SPEAKER_27]: of the closet and announce that the rumors
of my demise were exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_27]: At this point, I would like to take the
opportunity, I don't know if Mr. Andrus is
[SPEAKER_27]: here, but I would like to take the
opportunity to thank Mr. Andrus.
[SPEAKER_27]: Because Mr. Andrus is directly responsible
for me contacting Wendell Stevens.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Andrus made a statement to ABC News,
I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_27]: The statement was so out of character for
what I knew from Walt Andrus that I had to
[SPEAKER_27]: consider it very carefully.
[SPEAKER_27]: While working at the radio station,
I had the opportunity to view the
[SPEAKER_27]: pre-feeds that Network sends down to radio
stations so that you'll have an idea of
[SPEAKER_27]: what is going to come down the network
news.
[SPEAKER_27]: In that statement, Mr. Andrus said that
there are aliens on earth, that we have
[SPEAKER_27]: been invaded, and that they are here.
[SPEAKER_27]: I found this extremely out of character
for what I knew of Mr. Andrus.
[SPEAKER_27]: He was not the conservative person that I
had known, certainly wasn't the person
[SPEAKER_27]: that had been described to me by Coral
Lorenzen, which I might add at that time
[SPEAKER_27]: was not complimentary at all.
[SPEAKER_27]: But shortly thereafter, I was on Coral's
list also, so it didn't matter much.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I knew that I had made it wherever
made it was, because I was at the top of
[SPEAKER_27]: her list of people to avoid and to hate.
[SPEAKER_27]: I might add at this point, I have the
dubious honor of being the only person
[SPEAKER_27]: that Coral has tried to sue.
[SPEAKER_27]: When Coral did that, I knew then and there
that I had reached the top.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I will say this of Coral and Jim
Lorenzen, they have my honor.
[SPEAKER_27]: They have my admiration.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever my personal feelings about Jim
and Coral Lorenzen might be, they had the
[SPEAKER_27]: courage to do something that nobody else
did, and they were the very first.
[SPEAKER_27]: Their work made it possible for all of you
to be here today.
[SPEAKER_27]: And for that, I am eternally grateful.
[SPEAKER_27]: To continue, and I apologize for
digressing and going off into tangents,
[SPEAKER_27]: but that's the way I am.
[SPEAKER_27]: I read the statement that Mr. Andrus had
made on the wire service, and I said,
[SPEAKER_27]: this can't be right.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't believe this.
[SPEAKER_27]: After so many years, somebody of repute
came forward and said, yes, it's true.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was like a load was lifted off my
back.
[SPEAKER_27]: That very night, I contacted Wendell
Stevens and said, Wendell, he said,
[SPEAKER_27]: yes.
[SPEAKER_27]: Who the hell are you?
[SPEAKER_27]: Bill English.
[SPEAKER_27]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_27]: No, really, it's Bill English,
Wendell.
[SPEAKER_27]: Where the hell are you?
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_27]: Virginia?
[SPEAKER_27]: I heard you were dead.
[SPEAKER_27]: We thought you were dead.
[SPEAKER_27]: Where have you been?
[SPEAKER_27]: So I rehashed the scenario with Wendell,
Wendell being a little bit more aware of
[SPEAKER_27]: what the circumstances were at the time
and why I disappeared.
[SPEAKER_27]: Could understand it.
[SPEAKER_27]: He told me, you know, you're in a book.
[SPEAKER_27]: To which I responded, no shit.
[SPEAKER_27]: Said, yeah, a fellow by the name of Bill
Steinman and I wrote a book.
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I helped him.
[SPEAKER_27]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_27]: How do I get a copy of the book?
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I'll send you one.
[SPEAKER_27]: Say, can I tell anybody that you're still
there?
[SPEAKER_27]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want anybody to know I'm here.
[SPEAKER_27]: Send me the book and I'll talk to you.
[SPEAKER_27]: Several days later, I received the book in
the mail and I sat down and read it.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I was greatly disturbed at what I
read.
[SPEAKER_27]: Not because what was in the book was a
lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_27]: The information that was in the book was
extremely accurate.
[SPEAKER_27]: Wendell had very faithfully seen to it
that all the information was there.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was disturbed because after so many
years, I was forced to sit down and
[SPEAKER_27]: remember the circumstances that brought me
to that point in my life.
[SPEAKER_27]: I then sat down with my wife and said,
Valerie, I want you to read this.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is who I am.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's finally coming.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's finally coming out in the open.
[SPEAKER_27]: She read it.
[SPEAKER_27]: She said, is it true?
[SPEAKER_27]: I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_27]: Then she said, what are you going to do
about it?
[SPEAKER_27]: What are we going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_27]: I said, well, what should we do about it?
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_27]: I said, well, boy, you better get off your
ass and get out there and start talking
[SPEAKER_27]: about it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Because it's obvious somebody out there
knows what's going on and they had better
[SPEAKER_27]: get the straight information.
[SPEAKER_27]: And when she said that, I fell in love
with that lady all over again.
[SPEAKER_27]: She had more courage than I did.
[SPEAKER_27]: Either that or she was extremely naive.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I like to think she was courageous.
[SPEAKER_27]: So after reading it, reading the book,
and going through all that, I finally
[SPEAKER_27]: contacted John Lear.
[SPEAKER_27]: First time I contacted him, I posed as
Bill English's lawyer.
[SPEAKER_27]: Called him up and said, I'm Mr. English's
lawyer, legal attorney.
[SPEAKER_27]: He told me to contact you and find out
what the hell you want.
[SPEAKER_27]: John told the lawyer what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_27]: He was very honest, very straightforward
about it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I thanked him, hung up.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then I didn't call him back for about
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I considered everything.
[SPEAKER_27]: Finally, at the end of two weeks,
I called him back.
[SPEAKER_27]: We talked for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_27]: He asked if he could meet me in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I said, yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had a great inconvenience to him and at
much expense.
[SPEAKER_27]: He flew to Virginia to meet me.
[SPEAKER_27]: Where I met him at Lynchburg Airport.
[SPEAKER_27]: Immediately upon his arrival for the first
time in eight years, we were followed.
[SPEAKER_27]: The government knew where I was at.
[SPEAKER_27]: John came into the airport terminal.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was wearing a beard, grubby old Levi's,
the blue vest that many of you have seen
[SPEAKER_27]: me walking around in the last few days,
my lucky vest.
[SPEAKER_27]: He sat down.
[SPEAKER_27]: He had no idea what I looked like.
[SPEAKER_27]: I sat down next to him, waited for a
couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_27]: Turned around and looked at him and said,
you can buy me a drink.
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_27]: And John, being the trooper and he is,
didn't say a word.
[SPEAKER_27]: Got up, grabbed his bag, walked out the
door.
[SPEAKER_27]: Our trails followed us out the door.
[SPEAKER_27]: We jumped in John's car and headed to a
local bar where John bought me a drink.
[SPEAKER_27]: Two gentlemen followed us into the bar.
[SPEAKER_27]: John and I scooted out of the bar and
headed for my home.
[SPEAKER_27]: The next few days, John,
[SPEAKER_27]: very graciously, but very thoroughly,
grilled me.
[SPEAKER_27]: Reminded me of things that I had not
remembered for many years.
[SPEAKER_27]: My chief concern when I spoke to Mr. Lear
was I did not know him and I did not want
[SPEAKER_27]: to come off as an idiot.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did not want him to think that I was
another nutcase.
[SPEAKER_27]: It wasn't until about a month later when
Mr. Lear sent me a copy of his report on
[SPEAKER_27]: meeting with me that I finally had an idea
of what he thought of me and I was deeply
[SPEAKER_27]: gratified.
[SPEAKER_27]: To see that he believed me.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Lear is officially retiring from
active UFO investigations.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I cry for it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Objectively, he has not been in the field
for very long, but what he has done has
[SPEAKER_27]: been phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Lear is perhaps one of the finest men
I know.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever else you might think of him as an
investigator, as a controversial figure,
[SPEAKER_27]: as a human being, the man has heart.
[SPEAKER_27]: And there's damn few of us anymore that
can say that about anybody.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now that I've covered, for the most part,
what I've had to say with review,
[SPEAKER_27]: guard to reviewing, some of these
circumstances which have brought me here
[SPEAKER_27]: tonight, it's now necessary for me to
address the question of Mr. Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: Last night, Mr. Moore stood up here and
said, we must stop the character
[SPEAKER_27]: assassination.
[SPEAKER_27]: We must stop the infighting.
[SPEAKER_27]: We must stop the disinformation.
[SPEAKER_27]: And as he was saying that, I was walking
around the back of this auditorium about
[SPEAKER_27]: readied up.
[SPEAKER_27]: I didn't even want to pop a court because
the man was standing there telling you a
[SPEAKER_27]: bald faced lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: He has not stopped the character
assassination and he never did.
[SPEAKER_27]: Nine months ago, when Mr. Moore discovered
that I had resurfaced, he was asked by two
[SPEAKER_27]: engineers from Aeroget Corporation,
what he thought of me and my viewing of
[SPEAKER_27]: the documents.
[SPEAKER_27]: The documents that I said I had viewed.
[SPEAKER_27]: To which he responded, Bill English told
me that he and Jerry Schultz were doing
[SPEAKER_27]: LSD when they wrote the blue book
summation.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a documented fact.
[SPEAKER_27]: Bill did in fact say this and I have a
letter from him stating that he said it.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I have that letter here today.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's in the possession of Mr. John Lear
because I gave it to him yesterday
[SPEAKER_27]: morning.
[SPEAKER_27]: That statement is an out and out lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: I never made such a statement to Mr.
Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: In fact, I do not do drugs.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a hard time taking drugs even those
prescribed by the doctor.
[SPEAKER_27]: I said nothing at that point because I
wanted to wait and see what else was going
[SPEAKER_27]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_27]: Then Mr. Moore came out with that Bukaka
UFO television show of his, which in my
[SPEAKER_27]: estimation was designed to do nothing more
than discredit the science of ufology.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's exactly what it did.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was poorly produced, poorly written,
and it made UFO investigators look like
[SPEAKER_27]: absolute utter idiots.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was the cruelest blow that anybody
could have hit UFO investigators with.
[SPEAKER_27]: To add insult to injury, Mr. Moore had his
two buzzards pronounce the stuff that he
[SPEAKER_27]: said I'd been lying about for 13 years.
[SPEAKER_27]: Word for word, they parroted everything
that I had told him in 1979.
[SPEAKER_27]: One hour after viewing this travesty,
I got on the telephone to Alan Benz and
[SPEAKER_27]: got Mr. Moore's phone number.
[SPEAKER_27]: Alan is here tonight.
[SPEAKER_27]: He will confirm this.
[SPEAKER_27]: Bill was in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_27]: I spoke with Mr. Chandra.
[SPEAKER_27]: I told Mr. Chandra that I wanted a piece
of Mr. Moore's ass so bad I was ready to
[SPEAKER_27]: crawl through the phone and bite him on
the ear.
[SPEAKER_27]: I told Mr. Chandra that that show was
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_27]: That a man who for 12 years had said that
Bill English is a liar and a drug addict
[SPEAKER_27]: and a paranoid schizophrenic and every
kind of perverse son of a bitch that you
[SPEAKER_27]: can imagine produced a television show
that parroted everything that I had been
[SPEAKER_17]: saying for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_27]: My question at that time was, if I'm such
a liar, why would you produce a piece of
[SPEAKER_27]: crap like this and have someone say that?
[SPEAKER_27]: My question now is, after producing that
piece of shit, why would you stand in
[SPEAKER_27]: front of an audience of qualified,
intelligent people and tell them that it
[SPEAKER_27]: was a disinformation ploy?
[SPEAKER_27]: Another lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: Quite frankly, if Mr. Moore is not in this
for the money, then what the hell is he in
[SPEAKER_27]: it for?
[SPEAKER_27]: He's not done any good for UFO
investigation that I can determine,
[SPEAKER_18]: except hurt it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I would like to take this opportunity
right now to apologize to you and to those
[SPEAKER_27]: of you who support Mr. Moore, but facts
are facts.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever you may think of me,
[SPEAKER_27]: tomorrow morning I will get up and wash my
face and go to the bathroom and put my
[SPEAKER_27]: pants on just like most of you do.
[SPEAKER_27]: I will be here tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of you came to this meeting today
saying, we are going to get some answers.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I apologize to you because I don't
have any answers for you.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't even know what the questions are
anymore.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do know that we as a body must pull
together, not only in MUFONs, but in
[SPEAKER_27]: KUFOs, Center for International UFO
Studies, because all of the UFO
[SPEAKER_27]: organizations that are in existence today
must put aside their political
[SPEAKER_27]: aspirations, must put aside the politics
of their organization, must put aside
[SPEAKER_27]: their personal feelings.
[SPEAKER_27]: We must.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's imperative if we are going to
accomplish anything.
[SPEAKER_27]: This has long been my central repository
of records and information.
[SPEAKER_27]: Do it in such a manner that all
organizations can access the information.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks to a gentleman by the name of Mr.
Richard Scheffler out of Alamogordo,
[SPEAKER_27]: New Mexico, that dream has come true.
[SPEAKER_27]: In the last two months we have established
a computerized news and information
[SPEAKER_27]: service devoted strictly to UFO
information,
[SPEAKER_27]: quality UFO information.
[SPEAKER_27]: The information that goes into this board
will be approved by a board of approval
[SPEAKER_27]: consisting of several investigators of
renown who are, in fact, members of
[SPEAKER_27]: various UFO organizations.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of the members of this board do not
like each other.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of the members of this board do not
agree with each other.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of the members of this board hate
each other's guts.
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever your opinions and personal
conflicts might be, the members of this
[SPEAKER_27]: board are charged with the duty of
checking over whatever information is
[SPEAKER_27]: submitted to the UFINET bulletin board for
content investigative technique.
[SPEAKER_27]: We do not editorialize.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever is submitted will be put on the
computer exactly as it was submitted.
[SPEAKER_27]: There will be no deletions.
[SPEAKER_27]: There will be no editorial comment added
to it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_27]: What you see will be the original
document.
[SPEAKER_27]: It is my hope that we as an organization
of human beings can gather together and
[SPEAKER_27]: use this service to find the
disinformation, to make a determination as
[SPEAKER_27]: to what is true or not true, employ
scientific technique in the investigation
[SPEAKER_27]: of UFOs, and establish a firmer,
more solid foundation for this science of
[SPEAKER_27]: ours.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's exactly what this is.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a science.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have no established criteria per se for
investigators, but we hope eventually that
[SPEAKER_27]: will take place and that will be in the
field.
[SPEAKER_27]: For those of you who are not aware of my
particular situation, it's time for the
[SPEAKER_27]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have on sale in front a situation and
update report.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you would like, please come there.
[SPEAKER_27]: Right now I'd like to open up the floor to
questions.
[SPEAKER_27]: If there's anybody who has a question,
please feel free to ask it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I will answer it to the best of my
ability.
[SPEAKER_27]: If I cannot answer it, I will be honest
and tell you, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, dear.
[SPEAKER_34]: I would like to ask some questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_34]: Would you comment about the Philadelphia
experiment, Einstein and Marilyn Monroe?
[SPEAKER_35]: A little joke there for liberty.
[SPEAKER_27]: Be perfectly honest with you.
[SPEAKER_27]: The only thing I know about the
Philadelphia experiment is what I saw in
[SPEAKER_27]: the movie.
[SPEAKER_27]: I cannot give you a qualified opinion
about the book.
[SPEAKER_27]: And what was the rest of your question?
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, I was wondering, in connection with
that, about the mystery connected with
[SPEAKER_34]: Einstein's involvement with the
Philadelphia experiment and the rumors
[SPEAKER_34]: about Marilyn Monroe being not only
beautiful, but intelligence and her
[SPEAKER_34]: connection with the Kennedys and why
Jackie Kennedy kept quiet about
[SPEAKER_34]: everything.
[SPEAKER_34]: Could she also perhaps in fear for her
life?
[SPEAKER_27]: My dear lady, you are asking me questions
that I have absolutely no knowledge at all
[SPEAKER_27]: on.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't answer them for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you talk about the circumstances where
you reviewed this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Report 13 in England.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were in the service there,
or a little more detail?
No.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a civilian employee.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was employed by the Department of
Defense Security Services Command.
[SPEAKER_27]: A document came across my desk in a
diplomatic pouch with a disposition form
[SPEAKER_27]: instructing me to analyze the document,
assign it a probability rate as to whether
[SPEAKER_27]: or not it was true, whatever.
[SPEAKER_27]: All I did was my job, which is essentially
analyze the document that was presented in
[SPEAKER_27]: my inbox and write a summation of it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Bill.
[SPEAKER_19]: Will you discourse at length about some of
the contents of this document and just get
[SPEAKER_19]: into it for about five minutes and tell us
some of the things that you saw and,
[SPEAKER_19]: above all, some of your feelings towards
this mature.
[SPEAKER_19]: What were you feeling?
[SPEAKER_19]: What was it like to read this and tell us
about this material?
[SPEAKER_19]: Because as a ufologist, I'm more
interested in the flying saucers than I am
[SPEAKER_19]: about the petty squabbles between the
researchers.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_27]: At the time when I read the document,
it was reported in the document that the
[SPEAKER_27]: United States had in its possession
several UFOs.
[SPEAKER_27]: Technological reports showed that on a few
of them, they had been dismantled.
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a photograph of what was labeled
as an atomic generator or a nuclear power
[SPEAKER_27]: unit, which was no bigger than a
basketball.
[SPEAKER_27]: The inside of the craft apparently showed
apparently what were control boards with
[SPEAKER_27]: strange writing on them.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not a linguist, so I couldn't begin to
tell you what it said.
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a great deal of stuff,
a lot of things that just dealt most... I
[SPEAKER_27]: was more interested, to be honest with
you, in the autopsy pictures.
[SPEAKER_27]: Several of the autopsy pictures showed
alien cadavers on autopsy tables that had
[SPEAKER_27]: been vivisectioned.
[SPEAKER_27]: Several photographs showed an alien head
which had been removed from the body,
[SPEAKER_27]: cut in half, which showed brain casings.
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of these photographs were in color.
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of them were in black and white.
[SPEAKER_27]: One particular photograph that I remember
distinctly was that of three aliens shoved
[SPEAKER_27]: up against what appeared to be a white
tile wall in which they looked very
[SPEAKER_27]: confused and a photograph of them was
taken.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_27]: Live aliens.
[SPEAKER_37]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_37]: Isn't it true, Bill, that our government
believed for quite some time that these
[SPEAKER_37]: grays boasted that they created Jesus
Christ?
[SPEAKER_37]: I know it's kind of heavy, and I figured
I'd drop it on you.
[SPEAKER_27]: It is rumored that this is in fact what
has taken place.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's rumored that because of biogenetic
engineering, Jesus Christ was engineered
[SPEAKER_27]: by the aliens.
[SPEAKER_27]: Quite honestly, I have no knowledge of
that.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have no knowledge of this.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not a theologian, and to be perfectly
honest with you, that is a topic that I am
[SPEAKER_27]: afraid to even approach for the simple
fact that it is so hot I would get burned.
[SPEAKER_27]: I appreciate that, and thank you.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_20]: As a civilian employee and privileged to
that kind of information, I wonder what it
[SPEAKER_20]: was that led to them flopping that on your
desk and what your direct reaction to
[SPEAKER_20]: information about UFOs were.
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you have any previous orientation
toward UFOs or?
[SPEAKER_27]: Perfectly frank with you, I had no
interest in UFOs whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had no knowledge of them.
[SPEAKER_27]: We went into, we found the aircraft.
[SPEAKER_27]: We were supposed to bring out survivors if
there were any.
[SPEAKER_27]: There were none.
[SPEAKER_27]: At that time, I had no concept of UFOs,
ufology, mutilations whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_27]: We found the entire crew still in their
safety harnesses and their seat in the
[SPEAKER_27]: aircraft.
[SPEAKER_27]: The aircraft had not crashed.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was perfectly intact.
[SPEAKER_27]: The only visible damage that we could see
was the fact that the engine pods were
[SPEAKER_27]: damaged because the aircraft was sitting
on them.
[SPEAKER_27]: The crew had been mutilated, in every
classical sense of the word, as described
[SPEAKER_27]: by Linda Howell in her book of cattle
mutilations.
[SPEAKER_27]: We photographed the bodies.
[SPEAKER_27]: We grabbed dog tags.
[SPEAKER_27]: We destroyed the aircraft with the bodies
in it.
[SPEAKER_27]: We returned to our assigned base.
[SPEAKER_27]: Photographs were forwarded to McPhee
headquarters in Saigon.
[SPEAKER_27]: This was the last I ever saw of them until
1976 when they appeared in the Grudge Blue
[SPEAKER_27]: Book 13 report.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I recognized them as being the
photographs that I took.
[SPEAKER_27]: So I had no doubt whatsoever as to the
authenticity of the document.
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you think that they knew that handing
you the file for your analysis?
[SPEAKER_27]: It's entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: I could have been set up.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then beyond that, after you did
analyze it and write your report,
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm unfamiliar with that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm just wondering if that was what led
directly to your ousting in the service.
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_27]: Next question, please.
[SPEAKER_27]: We're running short on time.
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope you don't feel slighted.
[SPEAKER_27]: If I cut you off, but I'll try and get as
many in as I can.
[SPEAKER_27]: So please make it brief.
[SPEAKER_28]: I understand you had one day to analyze
the report.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the recollection I have from
reading about the report.
[SPEAKER_28]: And it was not until sometime later that
you tried to reproduce the report from
[SPEAKER_28]: memory.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, say again.
[SPEAKER_28]: It was sometime later when you tried to
kind of regenerate the report from memory
[SPEAKER_28]: from your one day analysis.
[SPEAKER_28]: One day or so.
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you characterize if you think that
your recollection of the report was
[SPEAKER_28]: complete or to what extent do you think
you were able to kind of regurgitate what
[SPEAKER_28]: you actually saw?
[SPEAKER_27]: Initially, it was about 95%.
[SPEAKER_27]: After 13 years, it's probably a little bit
less.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's actually a very high percentage.
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that just your talent?
[SPEAKER_27]: I have an idyllic memory.
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_28]: Your what?
[SPEAKER_27]: Your what?
[SPEAKER_27]: I have an idyllic memory.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I got it, but I can't say it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were shown a videotape narrated by Rod
Serling of the landing at Holloman Air
[SPEAKER_06]: Force Base.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the aliens' faces were described with
large noses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that contradicts most of the
descriptions we've heard about the
[SPEAKER_06]: popularly published descriptions of the
aliens.
[SPEAKER_06]: The photos that you saw of the cadavers,
did they suggest faces like those that we
[SPEAKER_06]: saw in that tape?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do you explain that discrepancy?
[SPEAKER_27]: You see some of the gentlemen walking
around here with these strange white tags
[SPEAKER_27]: hanging off their collars.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a picture of an alien.
[SPEAKER_27]: That pretty much characterized what they
look like in the pictures that I saw.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's entirely possible that those aliens
which landed at Holloman Air Force Base
[SPEAKER_27]: were of a different species.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_33]: I have a question about a book that I
discovered being mentioned in the Flying
[SPEAKER_33]: Saucer review.
[SPEAKER_33]: In fact, being debunked and ridiculed
there and actually found a bookstore in
[SPEAKER_33]: Los Angeles, the book called The Rancher.
[SPEAKER_33]: And when I opened it, the thing that
grabbed my attention was mentioning of
[SPEAKER_33]: universes, Schubert universes,
central universes, Loki universes,
[SPEAKER_33]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_33]: And having some background in physics,
in engineering, and being interested in
[SPEAKER_33]: different dimensions, I said, well,
gee, interesting.
[SPEAKER_33]: Got the book.
[SPEAKER_33]: And I've been reading it carefully all
these months.
[SPEAKER_33]: It was written in 34, 35, translated into
English in the subsequent years,
[SPEAKER_33]: probably distributed through some... Your
point, sir.
[SPEAKER_27]: Please, we're running short on time.
[SPEAKER_33]: My question is, did you find any
mentioning of this book in the documents
[SPEAKER_33]: that you came in contact with?
[SPEAKER_33]: Because in the book, there are many
chapters that will describe alien
[SPEAKER_33]: anatomies of different dozens of cases.
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, first of all, I'm not familiar with
the book.
[SPEAKER_27]: What I saw in the document was technically
oriented.
[SPEAKER_27]: There was made mention of the possibility
of interdimensional travel.
[SPEAKER_27]: But at that point, and now, I have no
knowledge of physics whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_27]: So I could not answer you.
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not a book about dimensions.
[SPEAKER_33]: It's more a book about life in the
universe and the different types of beings
[SPEAKER_33]: in the universe.
[SPEAKER_33]: And they would have chapters and chapters
of a listing of different biological types
[SPEAKER_33]: of entities, a lot of knowledge in
chemistry and physics, astronomy,
[SPEAKER_32]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_27]: Having not read the book, I can't give you
an honest and qualified answer.
[SPEAKER_27]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir, Bill.
[SPEAKER_08]: We knew that the aliens are very good at
telepathy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if in the early days, the aliens were
mistreated by humans, don't you think that
[SPEAKER_08]: that was conveyed to the alien nation
early on?
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a result, I mean, don't you think
they're waiting to get even or have gotten
[SPEAKER_08]: even?
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, not being telepathic, I can't answer
that question, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_27]: If they are telepathic, I would imagine
that if one knows, they all know.
[SPEAKER_27]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank
you very much for allowing me this time.
[SPEAKER_27]: And thank you for listening to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's absolutely the worst introduction I
have ever had.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't trust the males these days.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ladies and gentlemen, friends and
adversaries, associates and colleagues,
[SPEAKER_15]: in short, fellow ethologists, I had really
wanted to come here tonight and kick ass.
[SPEAKER_15]: But fortunately for us, all wiser heads
have prevailed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're going to keep this thing
professional.
[SPEAKER_15]: Before I begin, it seems appropriate to
first take a few moments to personally
[SPEAKER_15]: thank Mr. Walt Anders of the MUFON
organization and the organizers and hosts
[SPEAKER_15]: of this symposium, whose kind invitation
made it possible for me to be here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also appreciative of this excellent
time spot, which must mean that those who
[SPEAKER_15]: arranged the schedule must think that I
have something to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll try not to disappoint you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I might also add that my talk here tonight
is primarily directed at those of you who
[SPEAKER_15]: are members of the UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not to suggest that those of you
who are here as third parties won't find
[SPEAKER_15]: it interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that you might not be able to
follow some of the in-house comments I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: going to make.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's supposed to outhouse comments,
which I'll try to avoid, even though some
[SPEAKER_15]: cases they may be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_15]: Having anticipated the faltering star,
allow me to introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm aware that you already know my name,
and I'm equally certain that many of you
[SPEAKER_15]: are wondering just who is Bill Moore?
[SPEAKER_15]: And what's he up to?
[SPEAKER_15]: Added to that, I'm sure, are many other
questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this man a government agent?
[SPEAKER_15]: What about his rumored contacts within the
intelligence community?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are the MJ-12 documents real?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or are they counterfeit?
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they're counterfeit, did he forge
them?
[SPEAKER_15]: And isn't he really in it for the money,
after all?
[SPEAKER_15]: The truth about Bill Moore, I'm afraid,
is considerably less sensational.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you out there that know me well
can vouch for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who don't can verify it easily
enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: Bill Moore graduated from college in 1965.
[SPEAKER_15]: Between that time and 1979, I spent 14
years as a high school teacher and a
[SPEAKER_15]: concurrent 10 years as a part-time labor
relations expert within the structure of
[SPEAKER_15]: the Minnesota Education Association.
[SPEAKER_15]: In both cases, I had an excellent
reputation.
[SPEAKER_15]: In 1979, after having successfully
published the Philadelphia Experiment with
[SPEAKER_15]: co-author Charles Berlitz, I resigned my
teaching position and moved with my family
[SPEAKER_15]: to Arizona in order to take up writing
full-time.
[SPEAKER_15]: In 1980, I co-authored a second
bestseller, the Roswell Incident,
[SPEAKER_15]: which was the preliminary account of an
investigation into an alleged UFO crash in
[SPEAKER_15]: New Mexico in 1947.
[SPEAKER_15]: At that time, the book was skeptically
received by the UFO community and
[SPEAKER_15]: mercilessly panned by the debunkers.
[SPEAKER_15]: I stood my ground, broke with Berlitz,
weathered the storm of rocks and mud that
[SPEAKER_15]: was thrown in my direction, and
ultimately, with continued high-quality
[SPEAKER_15]: research and a careful, skeptical,
journalistic approach, managed to persuade
[SPEAKER_15]: many of the initial doubters that there
was indeed something to the case.
[SPEAKER_15]: In so doing, I earned the respect of many
of you in the audience.
[SPEAKER_15]: I expect that my reputation and
credibility with respect to the Roswell
[SPEAKER_15]: case is at least partly responsible for my
having been invited to speak here tonight.
[SPEAKER_15]: I urge you to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're one of those who respects my
work on Roswell, then I ask you to
[SPEAKER_15]: consider that I'm trying to carry on the
same sort of quality investigation with
[SPEAKER_15]: respect to my current project.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that the circumstances are quite
different, and I've not been in a position
[SPEAKER_15]: until now to properly inform others about
what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: This, unfortunately, has given rise to
considerable controversy with a number of
[SPEAKER_15]: false hoods having been spread by others
in the UFO community who saw fit to jump
[SPEAKER_15]: to hasty conclusions inappropriately
formed without benefit of all the facts.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the most persistent rumors about me
is that I'm a rich man, or that I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: somehow funded by the government to spread
disinformation and dissension within the
[SPEAKER_15]: UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither could be further from the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: The real Bill Moore is as poor as a church
mouse.
[SPEAKER_15]: I came away from a divorce in 1983 with
virtually nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I went through bankruptcy shortly
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_15]: I began to rebuild my life.
[SPEAKER_15]: The money I make from writing,
royalties, and the sale of mostly
[SPEAKER_15]: UFO-oriented books and publications has
all plowed back into living expenses and
[SPEAKER_15]: continuing research.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a constant scrape to get by,
but I believe in what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in order to preserve the freedom
necessary to continue, I've had to make
[SPEAKER_15]: sacrifices.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm definitely not in this business for
the money.
[SPEAKER_15]: I live in a rented house.
[SPEAKER_15]: I drive a 1977 car and a 1979 motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no savings accounts, no stocks,
no bonds, and I recently dropped my health
[SPEAKER_15]: insurance because I couldn't afford it any
longer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not looking for a handout,
nor do I expect any sympathy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I simply tell you this because I want it
on the record.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who are spreading rumors that I live
in wealth and comfort are invited to come
[SPEAKER_15]: and verify the situation any time they
wish.
[SPEAKER_15]: My door is open.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who allege that I have counterfeited
documents and concocted a hoax on the
[SPEAKER_15]: MJ-12 matter had better take the same
facts into account.
[SPEAKER_15]: Rest assured, I know myself well enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I was trying to perpetrate a hoax,
I would have played it for all the cash I
[SPEAKER_15]: could get a long time ago and taken the
money and run, as some are doing even now
[SPEAKER_15]: in the UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as for my being on the government,
I can only say that I wish I was.
[SPEAKER_15]: The government pays well and it provides
excellent benefits.
[SPEAKER_15]: So why should you believe anything Bill
Moore has to say?
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact is that I have information that
will add to your knowledge of the UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_15]: I will report it to you in as reliable a
fashion as I can and in as objective a
[SPEAKER_15]: manner as possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you who have numbered among my
friends and supporters will perhaps find
[SPEAKER_15]: it comforting in light of some of the more
outrageous rumors that have been
[SPEAKER_15]: circulating throughout the UFO community
recently.
[SPEAKER_15]: Others of you who have chosen to cast
aspersions and throw rocks in my
[SPEAKER_15]: directions out of fear that I might
uncover something which will upstage your
[SPEAKER_15]: own efforts will undoubtedly take great
pains to dissect what I have to say here
[SPEAKER_15]: in an effort to find more reasons to
question it.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the final analysis, I am not asking you
to believe, only to listen.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you do from that point is entirely up
to you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Two years ago at the MUFON Symposium in
Washington D.C., I stood before a similar
[SPEAKER_15]: audience and presented preliminary
information on the so-called MJ-12 papers.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also alluded at that time to a series of
ongoing contacts between myself and a
[SPEAKER_15]: number of well-placed individuals within
the government and the intelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: community.
[SPEAKER_15]: American youthology has been in a turmoil
over the MJ-12 matter ever since,
[SPEAKER_15]: with charges and counter-charges being
thrown back and forth so fast that it's
[SPEAKER_15]: almost impossible to keep up with them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Worse, the rumor mill fueled by
speculation, disinformation, and
[SPEAKER_15]: increasingly gross exaggerations on the
part of those who ought to know better has
[SPEAKER_15]: emerged as a major force which,
it sometimes seems from this vantage
[SPEAKER_15]: point, has all but replaced common sense
and solid judgment in some circles.
[SPEAKER_15]: What ought to have been a sane and
concerted effort to get at the truth has
[SPEAKER_15]: taken on virtually all the trappings of a
three-ring circus.
[SPEAKER_15]: And American youthology, as I see it,
now stands at the edge of a severe crisis
[SPEAKER_15]: which has already shaken it.
[SPEAKER_15]: To its very core, I have every confidence
that youthology will survive.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it will emerge from this present
state of flux with as much credibility as
[SPEAKER_15]: it had going in, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, for one, am somewhat ashamed and
embarrassed by the mudslinging that I have
[SPEAKER_15]: witnessed, much of it directed at me,
these past two years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the incessant and increasing
rumor-mongering which has tantalized us
[SPEAKER_15]: all by its highly sensational nature and
yet, in the final analysis, has offered us
[SPEAKER_15]: so very little in the way of tangible
evidence.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope what I have to say here tonight
will have the positive effect of laying
[SPEAKER_15]: some of it to rest.
[SPEAKER_15]: But speaking in all candor, I certainly
won't count on it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Throughout our history, mankind has
witnessed many quests and in every case,
[SPEAKER_15]: those who study history tell us that there
was the inevitable plaque of narrow-minded
[SPEAKER_15]: fools who, believing that such quests
waste time and energy better spent on
[SPEAKER_15]: useful endeavors, did everything they
could to discourage the process and
[SPEAKER_15]: discredit the individuals involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pardon my observations, but so it is with
our present quest for knowledge about
[SPEAKER_15]: UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether UFOs are or are not
extraterrestrial is really only a part of
[SPEAKER_15]: the picture.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the final analysis, the process of
studying this phenomenon and the people
[SPEAKER_15]: involved with it, of assessing the claims
and the counterclaims, and of dealing with
[SPEAKER_15]: the question of how we as earthlings will
react to the discovery of a race of
[SPEAKER_15]: extraterrestrial visitors and how they
will react to us.
[SPEAKER_15]: All of this and more when finally looked
at in perspective.
[SPEAKER_15]: Leads us to the inescapable recognition
that in studying the UFO phenomenon,
[SPEAKER_15]: we are at the same time becoming more
aware of ourselves as individuals and
[SPEAKER_15]: learning something about the society that
we are a part of.
[SPEAKER_15]: The recognition, as noted by my friend
Stan Friedman many years ago, that any
[SPEAKER_15]: alien spending 10 minutes looking at
planet earth must come away with the
[SPEAKER_15]: conclusion that we are in the eyes of that
alien, nothing more than a primitive
[SPEAKER_15]: society whose major activity is tribal
warfare, is at once both revealing and
[SPEAKER_15]: powerful.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is through the mirror of UFOs as alien
visitors that we ultimately come to look
[SPEAKER_15]: at ourselves and to recognize what and who
we really are.
[SPEAKER_15]: Such a process can only prove beneficial
to mankind in the long term regardless of
[SPEAKER_15]: what the true nature of UFOs turns out to
be.
[SPEAKER_15]: And those who would stand in its way by
attempting to heap derision or ridicule
[SPEAKER_15]: upon the subject do us a grave disservice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Had mankind's greatest inventors,
scientists, explorers, builders,
[SPEAKER_15]: painters, musicians, composers,
physicians, surgeons, the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_15]: The point is, had these people throughout
our history heeded the mindless
[SPEAKER_15]: blusterings and ravings of the skeptics,
the scoffers and the debunkers who were
[SPEAKER_15]: present in each and every case,
there would have been no progress and
[SPEAKER_15]: mankind would still be in the stone age.
[SPEAKER_15]: Moreover, in every case where a
breakthrough was achieved and progress was
[SPEAKER_15]: made, it is the achiever who is remembered
and honored by history and not the
[SPEAKER_15]: debunker and the skeptic who said it could
not be done.
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line here is that the UFO
phenomenon is a legitimate study by anyone
[SPEAKER_15]: in our free society who chooses to do so.
[SPEAKER_15]: And those who have elected to participate
in such a quest should not be held up to
[SPEAKER_15]: derision and ridicule because of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those debunkers and UFO bashers who have
nothing positive to contribute are advised
[SPEAKER_15]: to go and massage their egos somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_15]: In my opinion, those people have no right
whatsoever to dictate to others what is
[SPEAKER_15]: fit for study and what is not,
or what people should believe and what
[SPEAKER_15]: they shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_15]: Which brings me to my next point.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been accumulating information on the
UFO phenomenon for more than 25 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: During that time, I have watched ufology
trying to grow up, trying to achieve
[SPEAKER_15]: respectability with the public,
the news media, and the scientific
[SPEAKER_15]: community.
[SPEAKER_15]: In that process, I am sorry to say it's
been my observation that we have been our
[SPEAKER_15]: own worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_15]: No skeptic.
[SPEAKER_15]: No debunker could possibly do what we have
done to ourselves not once, but time and
[SPEAKER_15]: time again.
[SPEAKER_15]: We say we want respectability,
yet we have made little effort to
[SPEAKER_15]: construct the foundations necessary to
achieve it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sadly, we have no uniform standards,
no professional ethics, no peers,
[SPEAKER_15]: no qualifications, no uniform goals,
and few courage.
[SPEAKER_15]: No one speaks for ufology.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or rather, perhaps more correctly,
everybody speaks for ufology, all at the
[SPEAKER_15]: same time, and each with a different
voice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody can be a ufologist.
[SPEAKER_15]: All they need to do is tack the title of
the end of their name and publish,
[SPEAKER_15]: yes, even self-publish, a book,
start a newsletter, or get themselves on
[SPEAKER_15]: television.
[SPEAKER_15]: And should their material be pure
unsubstantiated clop trap or broken
[SPEAKER_15]: crockery, that's cracked pottery for those
of you that don't get that one,
[SPEAKER_15]: no matter, there's always some other
self-styled ufologist who will come along,
[SPEAKER_15]: see it as the ultimate wisdom of the
universe, and endorse it wholeheartedly,
[SPEAKER_15]: thus adding further to the confusion.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it any wonder we have degenerated into
a host of political camps, each one of
[SPEAKER_15]: which throws rocks at as many of the
others as possible, while at the same time
[SPEAKER_15]: loudly proclaiming to all who will listen
that they are the only true religion?
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwhile, the debunkers, who are
essentially united under a single banner,
[SPEAKER_15]: throw rocks at all of us, and the public,
as hapless observer to the entire process,
[SPEAKER_15]: emerges more confused than ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: With that in mind, I would like to take a
moment and ask each and every member of
[SPEAKER_15]: this audience to reach down inside
yourself and come up with a true answer to
[SPEAKER_15]: a very important and difficult question.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you say publicly has no meaning in
this process.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's what you know inside of yourself to
be truth that matters.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want you to ask yourself, why are you
involved with the UFO phenomenon?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you truly desire answers, no matter
what those answers may be, and no matter
[SPEAKER_15]: how much those answers may be at variance
with what you presently believe?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or are you one of those people who thrives
on a continuing mystery, whose very
[SPEAKER_15]: position in the field of ufology requires
that the mystery of UFOs be perpetuated
[SPEAKER_15]: rather than solved, so that you can
continue in your self-styled role of
[SPEAKER_15]: importance?
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's suppose you are the head of an
organization devoted to the study of UFOs,
[SPEAKER_15]: and there are several such here,
including myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: What happens to your organization,
and ultimately to you yourself,
[SPEAKER_15]: if the UFO mystery is suddenly solved?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you truly want to see that happen,
or is it more palatable and convenient to
[SPEAKER_15]: keep the pot simmering for as long as
possible?
[SPEAKER_15]: Only you and you alone know what it is
that motivates you.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're one who's sincerely interested
in finding answers, and if you can proceed
[SPEAKER_15]: with an open mind, then maybe I can offer
you some inspiration.
[SPEAKER_15]: If, on the other hand, you are one who
prefers to inflate your own image through
[SPEAKER_15]: the spreading of unsubstantiated,
often alarming and increasingly
[SPEAKER_15]: sensationalistic disinformation and
hearsay and rumor, then I urge you to
[SPEAKER_15]: reassess your position and channel your
energies along more acceptable lines.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you haven't thought about that,
I urge you to do so.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's important that we all know where we
stand.
[SPEAKER_15]: As for myself, I made my decision a number
of years ago as a result of suddenly
[SPEAKER_15]: having found myself face-to-face with an
opportunity to learn more about what our
[SPEAKER_15]: government knows about UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe then, and I continue to believe
now, that it is possible to uncover
[SPEAKER_15]: answers by searching carefully and
competently for them in the right places.
[SPEAKER_15]: Finding those answers and thus ending my
so-called career as a ufologist poses no
[SPEAKER_15]: problems at all for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a writer, I'm interested in a variety
of subjects, many of them non-UFO related.
[SPEAKER_15]: Should I go as far as I feel I can with a
UFO question?
[SPEAKER_15]: I have plenty of other fish to fry,
many of which are just as interesting and
[SPEAKER_15]: every bit as challenging.
[SPEAKER_15]: The truth, fellow ufologists, is that I
have known precisely what I was doing all
[SPEAKER_15]: along.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that very few other people knew
what I was doing and it was this lack of
[SPEAKER_15]: information on the part of other
researchers that has given rise to so much
[SPEAKER_15]: controversy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Consequently, I harbor no grudge against
others who have attacked me sometimes
[SPEAKER_15]: bitterly because they disagreed with my
methods or because they mistook my refusal
[SPEAKER_15]: to answer their often legitimate questions
as a display of arrogance and contempt.
[SPEAKER_15]: I counsel patients then, and I counsel it
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: A rush to judgment is a dangerous and a
divisive thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who engage in such practices may
sound high-minded and well-informed at
[SPEAKER_15]: first blush, but in the long run,
they do nothing to enhance their own
[SPEAKER_15]: stature or credibility and they certainly
contribute nothing to our quest for
[SPEAKER_15]: answers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Consider the strange case of Mr. Smith,
Mr. Jones, and the jury.
[SPEAKER_15]: You, the audience, are the jury.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Smith is dead.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Jones is being tried for the murder.
[SPEAKER_15]: The prosecutor stands before you and gives
you these facts.
[SPEAKER_15]: When the police arrived in response to a
complaint that a fight was in progress,
[SPEAKER_15]: he says, Mr. Smith was found lying dead on
the floor of his apartment.
[SPEAKER_15]: The cause of death was strangulation,
and the body was still warm.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Jones was found bending over the body
with his hands still around the victim's
[SPEAKER_15]: throat.
[SPEAKER_15]: Neighbors and others who knew both men
have testified that there was considerable
[SPEAKER_15]: animosity between the two of them and that
on more than one occasion, Mr. Jones was
[SPEAKER_15]: heard to threaten Mr. Smith's safety and
well-being.
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, Jones had gone to see Smith,
and a violent argument ensued during which
[SPEAKER_15]: Jones strangled Smith.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately for Jones, the police
arrived before he was able to effect an
[SPEAKER_15]: escape from the scene.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the jury.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this sufficient evidence to condemn Mr.
Jones for murder?
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried out this scenario during
conversations with a number of people over
[SPEAKER_15]: the past few months, and I was amazed at
how many people agreed that it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of whom was my good friend,
Walt Andress, who recently saw fit to
[SPEAKER_15]: publish an outrageously lopsided piece of
trash in his newsletter written by a man
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never met, spoken to, or corresponded
with, and who could have easily obtained
[SPEAKER_15]: answers to his questions simply by taking
the trouble to ask.
[SPEAKER_15]: A significant minority who listened to my
Smith and Jones scenario, however,
[SPEAKER_15]: hesitated before passing judgment.
[SPEAKER_15]: What is Mr. Jones' defense?
[SPEAKER_15]: They wanted to know.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, that's really what it's all
about.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the case of Smith and Jones,
the truth is that it was Smith who invited
[SPEAKER_15]: Jones to his apartment with the intention
of quietly doing him in and disposing of
[SPEAKER_15]: the body before anyone was the wiser.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jones, however, turned the tables on Smith
and accidentally killed him in the process
[SPEAKER_15]: of self-defense.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it is in the case of Moore,
the government, and MJ-12.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who have already decided that I'm
one of the bad guys in this controversial
[SPEAKER_15]: case have done so on the basis of only
half a story.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have rushed to judgment without
hearing the defense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, some of the most vocal of my
critics have never once bothered to
[SPEAKER_15]: contact me and ask me if I had a defense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hasty pudding, as one recent tract put it
quite humorously, a tract which,
[SPEAKER_15]: by the way, I did not write, but which I
found to be most appropriate.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I can't provide you with
the entire case for the defense this
[SPEAKER_15]: evening.
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason is the defense is still in
process of completing its investigation.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can provide you with a significant
part of it enough so that at least you can
[SPEAKER_15]: begin to understand what I've been doing
and where it's all going.
[SPEAKER_15]: For some of you, it may not be what you
want to hear, but it's nonetheless true.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it should provide you with a good
sense of perspective concerning a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: other things that have been going on in
ufological circles recently.
[SPEAKER_15]: It all began more than 10 years ago with a
man named Paul Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me preface my remarks by offering the
sincere and candid statement that what I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: going to say is to the best of my
knowledge entirely true.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is offered without malice or prejudice
in any way and is under no circumstances
[SPEAKER_15]: intended to be libelous or defamatory.
[SPEAKER_15]: I genuinely, like Mr. Benowitz,
continue to regard him as a friend and
[SPEAKER_15]: have a great deal of sympathy for the
difficulties he's been through.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is not my intention to upset him with
these revelations, but rather to add a few
[SPEAKER_15]: facts to a record that's been out of
balance for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona
during the late summer of 1979,
[SPEAKER_15]: and as a result had become somewhat closer
to Jim and Coral Lorenzen of the Old
[SPEAKER_15]: Aerial Phenomena Research Organization,
or APRIL, in Tucson.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, they invited me to become a
member of the APRIL Board of Directors,
[SPEAKER_15]: and I accepted.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was in this capacity that I first
became acquainted with the work being done
[SPEAKER_15]: by Paul Benowitz and Dr. Leo Sprinkle
regarding an alleged UFO abduction
[SPEAKER_15]: involving a young woman and several
others, which had occurred some time
[SPEAKER_15]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: The woman had been hypnotically regressed
by Dr. Sprinkle and had provided a strange
[SPEAKER_15]: account of having witnessed a cattle
mutilation in process, and had
[SPEAKER_15]: subsequently, having been taken by her
alien abductors, into some sort of craft
[SPEAKER_15]: or facility where these aliens were
actively engaged in processing fluids and
[SPEAKER_15]: severed body parts obtained from these
cattle.
[SPEAKER_15]: During the course of the hypnosis
sessions, which began as near as I can
[SPEAKER_15]: recall in August of 1979, Benowitz had
become convinced that the aliens had
[SPEAKER_15]: implanted some sort of communication
device in the woman's head, and that they
[SPEAKER_15]: were using this device to control her
actions.
[SPEAKER_15]: His theory was that they could actually
see what she saw and hear what she heard
[SPEAKER_15]: by means of this device.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, Benowitz, being a physicist
by profession and having a certain amount
[SPEAKER_15]: of electronics equipment at his disposal
and the wherewithal to purchase more as
[SPEAKER_15]: needed, set out to determine whether it
might be possible to detect the
[SPEAKER_15]: electromagnetic signals he believed these
aliens must be using to exercise their
[SPEAKER_15]: control over their alleged victims,
and to try to devise a way to shield the
[SPEAKER_15]: victim from the control of the signals.
[SPEAKER_15]: He dubbed his effort Project Beta and
communicated to APRO in late 1979 that he
[SPEAKER_15]: believed he had succeeded in detecting
signals from UFOs and had begun to make
[SPEAKER_15]: calculations about the sort of electronic
and propulsion technology employed by
[SPEAKER_15]: these aliens.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was also at about this time that Paul
began to take both moving and still
[SPEAKER_15]: pictures of strange lights maneuvering in
the vicinity of the Manzano Nuclear's
[SPEAKER_15]: weapon storage facility, which is located
on the east of Kirtland Air Force Base in
[SPEAKER_15]: Albuquerque, and of which Benowitz had a
perfect view from his residence.
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz was convinced that these lights
were UFOs and that for some reason they
[SPEAKER_15]: were actively interested in both the
Manzano complex and the Coyote Canyon test
[SPEAKER_15]: area located directly south of Manzano on
the other side of the hills.
[SPEAKER_15]: During this time, the only awareness I had
of Benowitz and his work was what I was
[SPEAKER_15]: obtaining through APRO.
[SPEAKER_15]: I still had not met the man and in fact
was only mildly interested in the case.
[SPEAKER_15]: This based largely upon both Jim and Carl
Lorenzen's assessment of Benowitz as a
[SPEAKER_15]: dedicated researcher, but unfortunately
one who was, as Jim put it, prone to make
[SPEAKER_15]: great leaps of logic on the basis of
incomplete data.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both Jim and Carl felt that Benowitz had
already decided what he was going to find
[SPEAKER_15]: before he went looking for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Still, although I didn't come to know
about it, until a few months later,
[SPEAKER_15]: there apparently was something going on
involving UFOs near Manzano, particularly
[SPEAKER_15]: during August, September, and October of
1980.
[SPEAKER_15]: And several agencies of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government, including the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations, seemed more
[SPEAKER_15]: than just casually interested in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: In early September 1980, I was approached
by a well-placed individual within the
[SPEAKER_15]: intelligence community who claimed to be
directly connected to a high-level
[SPEAKER_15]: government project dealing with UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: This individual, who subsequently came to
be known as the Falcon, told me that he
[SPEAKER_15]: spoke for a small group of similar
individuals who were uncomfortable with
[SPEAKER_15]: the government's continuing cover-up of
the truth, and indicated that he and his
[SPEAKER_15]: group would like to help me with my
research into the subject in the hope that
[SPEAKER_15]: I might be able to help them find a way to
change their prevailing policy and get the
[SPEAKER_15]: facts out without breaking any laws in the
process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew I was being recruited, but at that
point, I had no idea for what.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, I was told that if I was
interested in cooperating with their
[SPEAKER_15]: group, I would further be contacted by a
liaison man, and that future meetings
[SPEAKER_15]: between me and the Falcon would be
arranged by this person.
[SPEAKER_15]: The liaison person who subsequently made
contact with me was AFOSI agent Richard
[SPEAKER_15]: Doty, a man who has since become quite
controversial in his own right,
[SPEAKER_15]: and who many people have mistakenly
assumed is the Falcon himself.
[SPEAKER_15]: The story of my contacts with the Falcon,
Doty, and subsequently a number of others,
[SPEAKER_15]: is something I will have considerably more
to say about at a later date.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm fully aware that such a course of
action will undoubtedly prompt the gossip
[SPEAKER_15]: mongers to begin circulating an entirely
newer way of outrageous and
[SPEAKER_15]: unsubstantiated rumors, but so be it.
[SPEAKER_15]: My purpose here is to deal only with that
part of the story which is directly
[SPEAKER_15]: connected to the Benowitz Affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: To those of you who want to know more
after hearing what I have to say tonight,
[SPEAKER_15]: I counsel continued patience.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have my assurance that the rest of the
story will ultimately be told as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: But before going back to the Benowitz
Affair, let me make several points which
[SPEAKER_15]: seem appropriate at this juncture.
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, on the question of Richard
Doty and the Falcon, it's important to
[SPEAKER_15]: note that the name Falcon was invented by
my partner, Jamie Chandere, and I in 1984,
[SPEAKER_15]: strictly as a way of facilitating our
talking to each other about this person,
[SPEAKER_15]: particularly on the telephone,
without having to use a name.
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard Doty, who continued to be liaison
man, was similarly referred to us,
[SPEAKER_15]: or by us, as the Sparrow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither Sparrow nor Falcon were aware that
we were using these terms in reference to
[SPEAKER_15]: them, nor was anyone else, to the best of
my knowledge, prior to about mid-1985.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was in mid-1987, just after we went
public with the MJ-12 papers, that at
[SPEAKER_15]: Falcon's suggestion, and with the
concurrence of Richard Doty, we began
[SPEAKER_15]: dropping subtle hints that Falcon might in
fact be Doty.
[SPEAKER_15]: Falcon felt that such a ploy would be
useful to him in continuing to protect his
[SPEAKER_15]: identity, while Doty, for his part,
said that if anybody asked, he could
[SPEAKER_15]: simply deny it, and that would be that.
[SPEAKER_15]: We agreed, and as many of you are
painfully aware, it turned out to be an
[SPEAKER_15]: excellent diversion, particularly with
respect to the effect it had following the
[SPEAKER_15]: UFO cover-up live show, which was
broadcast nationally in October 1988.
[SPEAKER_15]: In all fairness to Mr. Doty here,
I should also like to comment that in my
[SPEAKER_15]: assessment, Rick is much better at
following orders and implementing the
[SPEAKER_15]: schemes of others, than he is at coming up
with ideas of his own.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you that have devoted time and
energy to constantly badgering this man
[SPEAKER_15]: for more information, should be aware that
all you are doing is making nuisances of
[SPEAKER_15]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_15]: Rick is not the man you're after.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the person in the control panel.
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as I'm aware, no one outside of my
project has any idea who that person might
[SPEAKER_15]: be or what his motives are.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, it was Falcon who sought me
out in September of 1980, and it was
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard Doty, then with AFOSI at Kirtland
Air Force Base, who soon came into play as
[SPEAKER_15]: the middleman in that process.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shortly thereafter, it became apparent to
me that my supplying information to the
[SPEAKER_15]: government, through Doty, on the
activities of Paul Benowitz, Apro,
[SPEAKER_15]: and to a lesser extent, several other
individuals, was to be a part of this
[SPEAKER_15]: equation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also discovered that whatever it was
that Benowitz was involved with,
[SPEAKER_15]: he was the subject of considerable
interest on the part of not one,
[SPEAKER_15]: but several government agencies.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that they were actively trying to
defuse him by pumping as much
[SPEAKER_15]: misinformation through him as he could
possibly absorb.
[SPEAKER_15]: Being a very small part of that process
gave me, I thought, something of an
[SPEAKER_15]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_15]: It became my intention to play that
advantage for all the information I could
[SPEAKER_15]: get out of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz, for his part, continued to make
what, in my opinion, seemed to be
[SPEAKER_15]: increasingly irrational claims,
most of which gave every appearance of
[SPEAKER_15]: having been influenced by a heavy blanket
of disinformation mixed with a small but
[SPEAKER_15]: significant amount of truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: The problem was always one of keeping a
level head and trying to carefully sort
[SPEAKER_15]: the shit from the candy, something which
Paul didn't seem to be very good at.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then, Paul was by that time very
emotionally involved with the affair and
[SPEAKER_15]: rather skeptical of advice from any
quarter unless it supported what he had
[SPEAKER_15]: already decided was the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: From my vantage point, being detached from
the mainstream but still close enough to
[SPEAKER_15]: appreciate what was happening,
it was somewhat easier to assess the
[SPEAKER_15]: process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I first met Paul in early 1981 and
continued contacts with him on a fairly
[SPEAKER_15]: regular basis through mid-1985.
[SPEAKER_15]: Contact since then has been sporadic.
[SPEAKER_15]: My role in the affair was largely that of
a freelancer providing information on
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul's then current thinking and
activities.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had nothing whatsoever to do with the
counter-intelligence and the
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation, although I either knew or
was aware of a number of people directly
[SPEAKER_15]: involved with that end of things.
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard Doty was one of these people,
although I came to know Doty well enough
[SPEAKER_15]: to gain the impression that he was
faithfully carrying out orders which he
[SPEAKER_15]: personally found distasteful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Perhaps it was for this reason that the
Falcon had chosen him as liaison person,
[SPEAKER_15]: although I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Frankly, I don't believe that Doty does
either.
[SPEAKER_15]: In my opinion, he was simply a pawn in a
much larger game, just as I was.
[SPEAKER_15]: As for Benowitz, by 1981 he was gathering
data from a variety of sources and
[SPEAKER_15]: amalgamating it with information being fed
to him by a number of government people in
[SPEAKER_15]: whom, for some reason, he seemed to have
an implicit and abiding faith.
[SPEAKER_15]: The story that emerged from this melange
of fact, fiction, fantasy, hearsay,
[SPEAKER_15]: hard data, and government disinformation
was absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yet, somehow, Paul believed in it and set
out on a one-man crusade to tell the world
[SPEAKER_15]: that malevolent aliens from space were in
league with our government to take over
[SPEAKER_15]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_15]: What had begun in 1979 is an effort to
learn whether the behavior of a woman who
[SPEAKER_15]: claimed she had been abducted by UFO
aliens and was being influenced by some
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of radio remote control had,
in the space of less than three years,
[SPEAKER_15]: blossomed into a tale which rivaled the
wildest science fiction scenario anyone
[SPEAKER_15]: could possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, it seemed to me that Paul was
his own worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead of withholding judgment until all
of the facts were in, Paul insisted on
[SPEAKER_15]: repeatedly going off half-cocked to
virtually anyone who would listen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Members of the press, other UFO readers,
researchers, U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: congressmen and senators, people in
military command positions, members of the
[SPEAKER_15]: scientific establishment, even the
president himself, all were members or
[SPEAKER_15]: subjects of Paul's efforts to reach out
and tell the world what he sincerely
[SPEAKER_15]: believed to be happening.
[SPEAKER_15]: He wrote letters and made phone calls by
the hundreds.
[SPEAKER_15]: And to those who had neither the time nor
the inclination to look behind the words
[SPEAKER_15]: for a better understanding of the facts,
Paul, with his professional credentials
[SPEAKER_15]: and technical vocabulary, came off as a
rather credible individual which must have
[SPEAKER_15]: caused quite a rash of headaches among the
people in high places who were desperately
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to defuse him.
[SPEAKER_15]: The idea that UFOs had something to do
with the phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, an increasing number of UFO
cases wherein the individual or
[SPEAKER_15]: individuals involved claim to have been
abducted by UFO aliens and taken aboard
[SPEAKER_15]: their craft against their will.
[SPEAKER_15]: Public exposure to this phenomenon got a
big boost in 1981 with the appearance of
[SPEAKER_15]: Bud Hopkins' bestseller, Missing Time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And Paul was particularly interested in
these cases.
[SPEAKER_15]: His hypothesis that people were being
abducted, implanted with some kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: alien control device, and then being let
go again was completely consistent with
[SPEAKER_15]: the thinking of a number of other UFO
researchers at the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul's hypothesis, however, had a somewhat
more sinister spin than most.
[SPEAKER_15]: Third, his own experiments and research
regarding the radio signals he was
[SPEAKER_15]: receiving and the photographs and film
footage he was getting of unusual lights.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both of these phenomena seemed largely,
though not entirely, connected with goings
[SPEAKER_15]: on within the Kirtland Air Force Base
Sandia National Lab complex just south of
[SPEAKER_15]: Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no question that Paul was
receiving some sort of electromagnetic
[SPEAKER_15]: signal on his equipment.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is equally certain that his photos
and films do depict unusual lights,
[SPEAKER_15]: most of which were filmed while hovering
or maneuvering over the Kirtland Sandia
[SPEAKER_15]: complex.
[SPEAKER_15]: The real question here, however,
is whether Paul's evidence is sufficient
[SPEAKER_15]: to conclude that either of these phenomena
was directly related to UFO activity,
[SPEAKER_15]: or whether, in fact, a prosaic explanation
exists which is more directly related to
[SPEAKER_15]: some classified government project.
[SPEAKER_15]: Admittedly, strong arguments can be made
in both directions, either one of which
[SPEAKER_15]: can be offered as an adequate explanation
of the government's counterintelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: activities in this case, which was the
fourth factor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Government surveillance of Paul and his
activities, some of which Paul was astute
[SPEAKER_15]: enough to detect and some of which I had
learned about but Paul seemed unaware of.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul took the surveillance activities,
which included wiretaps and, according to
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul, even break-ins, as proof positive
that he was on to something big.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, he seemed largely unaware
that the same people who would go to such
[SPEAKER_15]: lengths to spy on him also had the
capabilities to mount an effective
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation campaign.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, by mid-1982, Paul's story
contained virtually all of the elements
[SPEAKER_15]: found in the current crop of rumors being
circulated around the UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: There were two groups of aliens,
one malevolent, one more friendly.
[SPEAKER_15]: The malevolent ones, which Paul referred
to as the greys, were really in control,
[SPEAKER_15]: and they were the ones responsible for the
cattle mutilations, for human abductions,
[SPEAKER_15]: and the implanting of sinister control
devices in humans, for having first made
[SPEAKER_15]: and then broken a secret treaty with the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government, for maintaining a secret
underground base under Archuleta Peak near
[SPEAKER_15]: Dulce in northwestern New Mexico,
and for having supplied the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government with alien space hardware and
weapons which ultimately proved defective
[SPEAKER_15]: or which were caused to crash,
thus leaving human civilization virtually
[SPEAKER_15]: defenseless against invasion.
[SPEAKER_15]: According to Paul, an atomic-powered
spaceship which they had given to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: had been caused to crash on Archuleta Peak
near the entrance to an underground alien
[SPEAKER_15]: base, and it sprayed the entire area with
radioactivity and wreckage.
[SPEAKER_15]: To prove it, he provided drawings which he
said he had made from photographs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I and others who examined Paul's
photographs as well as independently
[SPEAKER_15]: obtained pictures of the same area were
unable to see what Paul claimed was there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where he saw a crashed ship, burned
wreckage, entrances to the alien base,
[SPEAKER_15]: and weapons pointing skyward, others could
only see rocks, trees, and shadows.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no doubt that Paul believed that he
saw what he claimed, and for this I offer
[SPEAKER_15]: no explanation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I only know that what he claimed to see
wasn't what others saw.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no question that some of
Benowitz's pictures are interesting,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I must say that even though I viewed a
large number of them, I never saw one that
[SPEAKER_15]: I could get particularly excited about,
and I certainly never saw anything that I
[SPEAKER_15]: felt could be pointed to as proof positive
or even compelling evidence that he was
[SPEAKER_15]: photographing alien spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_15]: Much of his film was super 8 millimeter,
which is too small a format for good
[SPEAKER_15]: quality and large measurement.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is also no question that Paul was
intercepting some kind of low frequency
[SPEAKER_15]: electromagnetic emission.
[SPEAKER_15]: The question was and remains, where was it
coming from?
[SPEAKER_15]: What was its purpose?
[SPEAKER_15]: And indeed, most importantly, was it UFO
related at all?
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul, at least, was totally convinced that
he was receiving alien radio
[SPEAKER_15]: transmissions, and had even gone so far as
to develop a home computer program capable
[SPEAKER_15]: of translating them into English.
[SPEAKER_15]: The problem, as I saw it, was that his
program, which he told me had been
[SPEAKER_15]: developed with the assistance of the
aliens themselves, assigned entire words,
[SPEAKER_15]: sentence fragments, and sometimes even
entire sentences themselves to the various
[SPEAKER_15]: individual pulses of energy within these
transmissions.
[SPEAKER_15]: The technique involved was such that it
could just as easily have been adapted to
[SPEAKER_15]: assign similar alien translations to the
various energy pulses found in ordinary
[SPEAKER_15]: Morse code.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a number of Paul's computer
printouts, which contain translations of
[SPEAKER_15]: those allegedly alien messages.
[SPEAKER_15]: If one breaks these apart into their
component words, sentence fragments,
[SPEAKER_15]: and sentences, and then shuffles the
components, the result is such that the
[SPEAKER_15]: new message says virtually the same thing
as the old one.
[SPEAKER_15]: The messages look fascinating until one
examines the method by which they were
[SPEAKER_15]: derived.
[SPEAKER_15]: After that, they are not nearly so
interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, lots of people saw the
messages.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very few had the opportunity to examine
the computer program which generated them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Along these same lines, at least some of
the things Paul was seeing and identifying
[SPEAKER_15]: as alien spacecraft were definitely not
UFOs at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: One evening while visiting him,
we went out in his sun deck just at
[SPEAKER_15]: twilight.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he pointed out a series of lights
slowly maneuvering far out over the West
[SPEAKER_15]: Mesa, perhaps 25 or 30 miles away.
[SPEAKER_15]: These, he said, were alien craft involved
in abducting people and implanting them.
[SPEAKER_15]: There certainly were lights maneuvering
out there, but even through good
[SPEAKER_15]: binoculars, they were not readily
identifiable.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul insisted they were UFOs and showed us
how to conduct a little test with our
[SPEAKER_15]: binoculars, which he said would prove it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Interested, but unconvinced, I drove
directly to West Mesa immediately after
[SPEAKER_15]: leaving Paul's home and parked my car at a
spot where I felt I would be able to get a
[SPEAKER_15]: good look at anything flying around that
area.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure enough, helicopters carrying large
searchlights began to maneuver slowly over
[SPEAKER_15]: my vantage point only moments after I
arrived.
[SPEAKER_15]: One went directly over me at an altitude
of about 300 feet, and there is no doubt
[SPEAKER_15]: that it was a helicopter.
[SPEAKER_15]: The next day, I called Kirtland,
and they confirmed to me that there had
[SPEAKER_15]: indeed been a search and rescue training
mission in that area the night before.
[SPEAKER_15]: Such operations, they informed me,
were conducted over that area quite
[SPEAKER_15]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in 1982.
[SPEAKER_15]: Two years later, in 1984, Paul was still
making the same claims about these
[SPEAKER_15]: maneuvering lights to other UFO
researchers.
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as I'm aware, I was the only one
who took the trouble to check.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul is a convincing and compelling
individual in person.
[SPEAKER_15]: He talks an excellent story, and it's easy
to see why so many people have been so
[SPEAKER_15]: intrigued by it over the years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, too many of the people who
have interviewed Paul have chosen to draw
[SPEAKER_15]: their conclusions about him based solely
or largely upon what he says and not upon
[SPEAKER_15]: the entire body of evidence presented by
the larger picture of the case itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, too, have spent considerable time with
Paul over a period of years and came to
[SPEAKER_15]: know him quite well in that process.
[SPEAKER_15]: As already stated, I viewed a large number
of Paul's films and photographs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I carefully examined satellite and aerial
survey photographs of both Archuleta Peak
[SPEAKER_15]: and Mesa, as well as aerial photos of the
area taken by Paul himself.
[SPEAKER_15]: I examined the computer program Paul was
using to decode the alleged alien radio
[SPEAKER_15]: transmissions and communications,
and I had a lengthy discussion about this
[SPEAKER_15]: matter with the late Dr. Alan Hynek,
who had also independently examined Paul's
[SPEAKER_15]: program.
[SPEAKER_15]: I spent considerable time discussing the
affair with both Jim and Carl Lorenzen,
[SPEAKER_15]: both of whom were quite skeptical of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have copies of many of the reports
and letters Paul submitted to APRO
[SPEAKER_15]: beginning as far back as September of
1979.
[SPEAKER_15]: Moreover, as I have already stated,
I was personally aware of the intelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: community's concerted efforts to
systematically confuse, discourage,
[SPEAKER_15]: and discredit Paul by providing him with a
large body of information on the subject
[SPEAKER_15]: of UFOs, the malevolent aliens who
allegedly pilot them, the technology they
[SPEAKER_15]: employ, and the underground bases they
supposedly possess and occupy.
[SPEAKER_15]: The entire story of a secret treaty
between the US government and the aliens,
[SPEAKER_15]: of exchanges of technology between us and
the aliens, of battles between aliens and
[SPEAKER_15]: American armed forces, and of aliens
allegedly having implanted hundreds of
[SPEAKER_15]: thousands, if not millions, of human
beings for the purpose of taking over the
[SPEAKER_15]: world and using us as cattle or slaves
came about as a result of the
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know because I was in a position to
observe much of this process as it
[SPEAKER_15]: unfolded, and I was providing regular
reports on its effectiveness to some of
[SPEAKER_15]: the very people who were doing it to Paul.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can tell you that it was effective
because I watched Paul become
[SPEAKER_15]: systematically more paranoid and more
emotionally unstable as he tried to
[SPEAKER_15]: assimilate what was happening to him.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had guns and knives all over his house.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had installed extra locks on his doors.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he swore that they, meaning the
aliens, were coming through his walls at
[SPEAKER_15]: night and injecting him with hideous
chemicals which would knock him out for
[SPEAKER_15]: long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_15]: He told me he had no idea what they were
doing with him after he was knocked out.
[SPEAKER_15]: He began to suffer increasing bouts of
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_15]: Others took over the day-to-day operation
of his business as he went through this.
[SPEAKER_15]: One day, I watched him eat not a bite of
his lunch while he chain-smoked 28
[SPEAKER_15]: cigarettes in 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew at that time that he was not far
from an inevitable nervous collapse.
[SPEAKER_15]: His health had deteriorated.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had lost considerable weight.
[SPEAKER_15]: His hand shook as if from palsy,
and he looked terrible.
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried to counsel him to drop the entire
UFO thing before his health was completely
[SPEAKER_15]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_15]: He said he knew things were getting bad
and he was trying to cope with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not long afterward, I heard he had been
hospitalized and was under psychiatric
[SPEAKER_15]: care.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether UFOs were actually ever involved
with all of this, and to what extent,
[SPEAKER_15]: I never really knew.
[SPEAKER_15]: Perhaps Paul had nearly stumbled upon
signals generated from some sophisticated,
[SPEAKER_15]: high-level government project whose
security people had hit upon UFO-related
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation as their ultimate cover.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or perhaps he had discovered a real,
although somewhat less sensational,
[SPEAKER_15]: government UFO project, if that's
possible, which he elected to disinform
[SPEAKER_15]: him to protect what they were really
doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I do know, from first-hand experience,
that there was a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_15]: government disinformation involved and
that a large proportion of what we are
[SPEAKER_15]: hearing today about malevolent aliens,
underground bases, secret treaties with
[SPEAKER_15]: the US, government, has its roots firmly
planted in the Benowitz affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: Stories of an alleged UFO crash at Aztec
New Mexico are also a part of this
[SPEAKER_15]: picture, but I'll save comment on that
until later in this paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, from what I knew of all of
this, its purpose was strictly to
[SPEAKER_15]: discredit Benowitz and nothing more.
[SPEAKER_15]: What amazes me is that nearly a decade
later, these same stories continue to
[SPEAKER_15]: circulate.
[SPEAKER_15]: Recently, one of the most prominent
figures in the current disinformation wave
[SPEAKER_15]: which has been sweeping the UFO community
was quoted as having stated that he found
[SPEAKER_15]: all Benowitz's information to be 100%
true.
[SPEAKER_15]: This person spent a couple of days talking
to Benowitz back in the summer of 1987,
[SPEAKER_15]: and he has spent considerable time since,
spreading elaborate and increasingly
[SPEAKER_15]: sensationalistic stories based,
he claims, on information gathered from a
[SPEAKER_15]: variety of unnamed sources.
[SPEAKER_15]: Strip away the fluff, and what you have
left is essentially the Benowitz story all
[SPEAKER_15]: over again.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no question in my mind that it's
mostly disinformation, pure and simple.
[SPEAKER_15]: And since I know that connections exist
between those who are spreading it now and
[SPEAKER_15]: those who are spreading it then,
both from the Benowitz angle and from
[SPEAKER_15]: within the intelligence community,
it seems reasonable to conclude that those
[SPEAKER_15]: responsible for it are not satisfied their
task has been completed even after all
[SPEAKER_15]: this time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Knowing what is going on, however,
is simply not enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: The real question is why.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just that question I asked myself
when I first ran into the disinformation
[SPEAKER_15]: operation that was being run on Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: It seemed to me at that time that I was in
a rather unique position.
[SPEAKER_15]: There I was, with my foot literally in the
door of a secret counter-intelligence game
[SPEAKER_15]: that gave every appearance of being
somehow directly connected to a high-level
[SPEAKER_15]: government UFO project.
[SPEAKER_15]: And judging by the positions of the people
I knew to be directly involved with it,
[SPEAKER_15]: definitely had something to do with
national security.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no way.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to allow the opportunity to
pass me by without learning at least
[SPEAKER_15]: something about what was going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Many ufologists have run up against this
information over the years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Virtually all of them viewed it as a
negative process and backed away from it
[SPEAKER_15]: either in anger or disgust as soon as they
discovered what they were dealing with.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even today, the UFO community unanimously
considers anyone known or suspected
[SPEAKER_15]: dealing in disinformation to be one of the
bad guys, someone to be shunned or avoided
[SPEAKER_15]: at all costs, and certainly never ever to
be believed.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, on the other hand, determined to take
quite a different tack.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would play the disinformation game,
get my hands dirty just often enough to
[SPEAKER_15]: lead those directing the process into
believing that I was doing exactly what
[SPEAKER_15]: they wanted me to do, and all the while
continue to burrow my way into the matrix
[SPEAKER_15]: so as to learn as much as possible about
who was directing it and why.
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be a classic case of turning the
tables on the very ones who were most
[SPEAKER_15]: confident that they had the situation well
in hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was just one thing I needed to do
this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Secrecy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't tell anyone about what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: For if I did, and word got back to those
in control, I would be immediately cut off
[SPEAKER_15]: and cast adrift before I could learn
anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a formidable problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the contacts I had made during the
Benowitz affair seemed friendly and
[SPEAKER_15]: professed a desire to end the UFO cover up
and assist in getting government
[SPEAKER_15]: information on UFOs out to the public in a
slow and methodical manner so as not to
[SPEAKER_15]: create panic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Others seemed more interested in obtaining
information from me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Often on what other members of the UFO
community were doing and sometimes on
[SPEAKER_15]: other completely unrelated subjects.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever information I managed to get from
these individuals in return usually came
[SPEAKER_15]: as a result of asking just the right
questions in just the right ways.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes it took months or even years of
establishing a relationship with someone
[SPEAKER_15]: before anything useful came from it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The most difficult part of it all was
trying to determine what was real and what
[SPEAKER_15]: was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the key factors in any successful
disinformation scheme is that it must
[SPEAKER_15]: contain some elements of truth in order to
make it credible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Knowing that, however, is one thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Doing something with it is quite another.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're dealing with what you know to
be a classified program and you're
[SPEAKER_15]: determined to get information without
breaking any laws and running a foul of
[SPEAKER_15]: national security, you're walking a very
fine line and that's why it takes a long
[SPEAKER_15]: time to get results.
[SPEAKER_15]: In June of 1982, I approached my friend
Jamie Chanderay and brought him into the
[SPEAKER_15]: project.
[SPEAKER_15]: At that time, I also began briefing
Stanton as to what was going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both of them knew that I was in contact
with a number of people within the
[SPEAKER_15]: intelligence community on the subject of
UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And both were aware that at least some of
the information coming through was
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: But both only had minimal knowledge of the
private goals and conclusions I had
[SPEAKER_15]: established some months earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: As the project progressed, this actually
turned out to be more of an asset than a
[SPEAKER_15]: drawback.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, the three of us were an excellent
team in that we each approached the
[SPEAKER_15]: problem from a different angle.
[SPEAKER_15]: From my point of view, the process was one
of slowly and methodically burrowing into
[SPEAKER_15]: a beehive from the outside with a goal of
ultimately reaching the queen bee in the
[SPEAKER_15]: royal jelly at the center.
[SPEAKER_15]: Since I never knew whether the other bees
I was certain to meet along the way would
[SPEAKER_15]: be friendly or not, I had to proceed
cautiously both in order to avoid getting
[SPEAKER_15]: stung and to learn as much as possible
about what might lie ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: The control factor as I saw it rested
largely with me and the way I proceeded.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, on the other hand, saw it as a
somewhat different process.
[SPEAKER_15]: He too felt we were burrowing into a
beehive.
[SPEAKER_15]: But in his view of things, our burrowing
was at the express invitation of the queen
[SPEAKER_15]: bee herself, who clandestinely oversaw and
encouraged the process from a distance as
[SPEAKER_15]: part of her private plan to get free of
politics that surrounds and restrains her.
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as we followed the signposts along
the way, Jamie felt, the learning process
[SPEAKER_15]: would continue and we could never get
stung.
[SPEAKER_15]: Stanton, as the scientist of the group,
was the one best qualified to conduct a
[SPEAKER_15]: careful and organized search for
corroborating witnesses and evidence in
[SPEAKER_15]: places outside of the loop Jamie and I
were part of.
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, just as a matter of
personal privilege here, I would like to
[SPEAKER_15]: reiterate the act to a nasty comment about
Stanton which appeared in a recent issue
[SPEAKER_15]: of Jim Mosley's saucer smear newsletter.
[SPEAKER_15]: In this comment, the writer, after first
characterizing Stanton as a gullible
[SPEAKER_15]: individual, went on to wonder whether he
could be trusted to expose the MJ-12
[SPEAKER_15]: documents as phony if his research turned
up conclusive evidence to that effect.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a legitimate question and I'd like to
answer it by stating that not only Stanton
[SPEAKER_15]: but all of us are firmly committed to
releasing a full and complete report on
[SPEAKER_15]: this matter.
[SPEAKER_15]: If evidence should come to light
suggesting that the documents are phony,
[SPEAKER_15]: you have my firm assurance that it will
most certainly be included in the report.
[SPEAKER_15]: Gullibility is not an issue here.
[SPEAKER_15]: The matter is far larger than that.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, Stanton, Jamie and I are all
working toward the same goal.
[SPEAKER_15]: That of trying to discover what is truth
and what isn't with respect to the
[SPEAKER_15]: government and UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: My role in the Benowitz affair had at
least secured me a seat in the right
[SPEAKER_15]: theater.
[SPEAKER_15]: From there, it was only a question of
whether I could use my balcony ticket to
[SPEAKER_15]: discover who owned the place and was
making the major operational decisions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both Jamie and I felt that in order to
have any hope of success at all,
[SPEAKER_15]: we absolutely had to play the game
according to their rules.
[SPEAKER_15]: That meant doing everything possible to
give the appearance that we were
[SPEAKER_15]: essentially useful idiots who would cause
no trouble while at the same time playing
[SPEAKER_15]: the double game of keeping our eyes and
ears open in order to learn as much as we
[SPEAKER_15]: could about what was going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: In so doing, we were gradually able to
expand our base of friendly contact people
[SPEAKER_15]: while working our way further and further
into the truly bizarre intelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: labyrinth that surrounds the subject of
UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no problem in telling you that it's
been a tedious time and resource-consuming
[SPEAKER_15]: task which has been made all the more
difficult by the constant barrage of
[SPEAKER_15]: rocks, hoots and bottles thrown in our
direction from a segment of the UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: community which out of ignorance chose to
take up unfriendly and unsympathetic
[SPEAKER_15]: positions toward us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Were it not for the fact that we were
constantly challenged by the twists and
[SPEAKER_15]: turns of our project, and by the hope that
we could ultimately come away from it with
[SPEAKER_15]: a smoking gun in hand, I'm convinced we
would have thrown in the towel a long time
[SPEAKER_15]: ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, I must admit that there were
several occasions when we tried to do just
[SPEAKER_15]: that, only to be encouraged to continue by
some of our friends from the inside who
[SPEAKER_15]: had come to believe in what we were doing
and respected us for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The anonymous arrival of the so-called
MJ-12 documents in December of 1984 was
[SPEAKER_15]: another factor we had to contend with in
this increasingly confusing weapon.
[SPEAKER_15]: The problem of their origin and
authenticity was and remains a major
[SPEAKER_15]: issue.
[SPEAKER_15]: And on this point, our position of
neutrality has constantly been
[SPEAKER_15]: misinterpreted.
[SPEAKER_15]: Therefore, for the record, it is important
to point out here once again that at no
[SPEAKER_15]: time have either I or any of my associates
ever stated that these documents are
[SPEAKER_15]: authentic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Our position has consistently been that we
do not know whether they are authentic,
[SPEAKER_15]: but that we as investigators remain
unaware of any convincing evidence which
[SPEAKER_15]: would suggest that they are not.
[SPEAKER_15]: That position remains essentially
unchanged today, and I'll have more to say
[SPEAKER_15]: about it when I get to the end of this
paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line, however, is that
authentic or not, the story of the
[SPEAKER_15]: documents is a major story, and one which,
as I've already assured you, will
[SPEAKER_15]: ultimately be told when the time is ready
to tell it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That process has already taken
considerably longer than I had thought it
[SPEAKER_15]: would.
[SPEAKER_15]: I cannot predict when it will be complete,
but I can say that progress has been made,
[SPEAKER_15]: and I, for one, certainly hope it won't be
too much longer.
[SPEAKER_15]: For the many of you who have roundly
criticized our methodology throughout the
[SPEAKER_15]: MJ-12 controversy, it seems important to
note here that what you were witnessing
[SPEAKER_15]: was the operation of a plan to put out
just enough of this bizarre information to
[SPEAKER_15]: attract attention and then carefully
monitor who showed up with questions to
[SPEAKER_15]: ask or information to offer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, I was careful to state that I
remained unconvinced of the authenticity
[SPEAKER_15]: of the information involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the case of the Falcon and Condor
interviews broadcast last October on UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: cover-up live, I'm convinced that at least
some of that information falls under the
[SPEAKER_15]: category of disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm equally convinced that some of it is
true.
[SPEAKER_15]: The important point here is that
regardless of whether it is disinformation
[SPEAKER_15]: or truth, it does have to do with UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the sources who provided it felt that
doing so was important enough to risk
[SPEAKER_15]: going before national television in order
to accomplish that purpose.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember also that those sources knew that
Falcon and Condor would be identified on
[SPEAKER_15]: the show as confidential government
informants.
[SPEAKER_15]: The risk was all theirs, not ours.
[SPEAKER_15]: And still, they went ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just as they are currently going ahead
with the process of arranging a meeting,
[SPEAKER_15]: which will enable them to tell their
stories before one or more members of
[SPEAKER_15]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_15]: I submit to you that such a process is
extraordinary, regardless of the truth or
[SPEAKER_15]: deception involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's high time the UFO
community stopped throwing rocks at it and
[SPEAKER_15]: began to consider the implications.
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing I can assure you is that rocks
or not, our project will continue.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can either become involved,
as others in the UFO community have done,
[SPEAKER_15]: or you can sit back and wait for results.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever those results, good, bad,
positive or negative, you will hear about
[SPEAKER_15]: them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Our trolling of the bait by means of a
progressive release of information and
[SPEAKER_15]: ultimately by arranging for Falcon and
Condor to appear on the UFO Cover-Up Live
[SPEAKER_15]: show produced a variety of interesting
results.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shortly after the show, the FBI showed up
and began asking questions about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: They even arranged for a private showing
in the office of producer Michael
[SPEAKER_15]: Seligman.
[SPEAKER_15]: Agents on both East and West Coasts
interviewed a number of ufologists and
[SPEAKER_15]: other people, including Jamie Chanderay.
[SPEAKER_15]: But although I let it be known that I'd be
more than happy to talk to them,
[SPEAKER_15]: they avoided it.
[SPEAKER_15]: This I found to be particularly
interesting in light of the FBI's
[SPEAKER_15]: admission in response to a FOIA request,
that they have nearly 60 pages of material
[SPEAKER_15]: on me that is all classified for reasons
of national security.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in July of 1988.
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have no idea what those pages
contain.
[SPEAKER_15]: Another thing that occurred, as we had
hoped it would, was that a rather small
[SPEAKER_15]: number of people came out of the woodwork
claiming to have inside knowledge of one
[SPEAKER_15]: type or another about MJ-12 or similar
government UFO projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: After weeding out the obvious cranks and
several others whose claims did not check
[SPEAKER_15]: out or whose stories changed every time
they told them, we were left with a few
[SPEAKER_15]: leads which seemed promising.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's premature to offer you a report on
these at this time because we're still
[SPEAKER_15]: checking.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, seemingly in direct relationship to
our partial release of MJ-12, 12 material
[SPEAKER_15]: two years ago, the flow of UFO related
disinformation has escalated from a point
[SPEAKER_15]: of near insignificance to what has become
almost a flood tide.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, many of you in the audience came
here tonight looking for answers to
[SPEAKER_15]: questions related directly to that
problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: As I have taken great pains to point out,
the current crop of disinformation is
[SPEAKER_15]: really nothing new.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that a different crop of people
are spreading it this time around.
[SPEAKER_15]: I expect that those responsible,
not the rumor mongers themselves,
[SPEAKER_15]: but the ones who are feeding them,
thought it would work just as well this
[SPEAKER_15]: time as it did last.
[SPEAKER_15]: The one thing I'm sure they didn't count
on is that I would tell my story and thus
[SPEAKER_15]: blow their cover.
[SPEAKER_15]: And speaking of blowing cover,
[SPEAKER_15]: and speaking of blowing cover,
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's high time that I tell you
what I know about another situation that
[SPEAKER_15]: has found its way into the current crop of
UFO disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I offer this not to embarrass the person
involved, but rather to shed light on an
[SPEAKER_15]: incident which, by the accounts of it,
have appeared recently in a variety of
UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to share with you a few of the
UFO newsletters and at least one new book.
[SPEAKER_15]: As take rumor, Rick indicated he'd do
nothing about the matter and asked me to
[SPEAKER_15]: tell him everything I could.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did so.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I recall, he took some notes.
[SPEAKER_15]: We discussed a number of other things as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some months later, in early 1983,
I became aware that Rick was involved with
[SPEAKER_15]: a team of several others, including one
fellow from Denver that I knew of,
[SPEAKER_15]: and at least one who was working out of
Washington, D.C., in playing an elaborate
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation game against a prominent
cattle mutilation researcher who,
[SPEAKER_15]: at the time, had close connections with a
major television film company interested
[SPEAKER_15]: in doing a UFO documentary.
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I was not in a position to know
everything about what was going on,
[SPEAKER_15]: I had access to enough of it to conclude
that the government seemed hell-bent on
[SPEAKER_15]: severing the ties that existed between the
researcher and the film company.
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding was that because the
researcher was known to have close ties to
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz and had exhibited a strong
interest in his work, certain elements
[SPEAKER_15]: within the intelligence community were
concerned that the story of his having
[SPEAKER_15]: intercepted electromagnetic emissions from
the Kirtland-Sandia area would end up as
[SPEAKER_15]: part of the script of a feature film.
[SPEAKER_15]: Since this, in turn, might influence
others, possibly even the Soviets,
[SPEAKER_15]: to attempt similar interceptions,
someone in a control position apparently
[SPEAKER_15]: felt it had to be stopped before it got
out of hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, the prime objective of the
counterintelligence people who swarmed
[SPEAKER_15]: around Benowitz between 1980 and 1984
seemed to be the maintenance of a
[SPEAKER_15]: high-level security net around the radio
signals he was intercepting.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was unable to determine why this was a
priority at the time, and I still do not
[SPEAKER_15]: know today.
[SPEAKER_15]: What I do know, however, is that since
they couldn't physically stop Paul from
[SPEAKER_15]: intercepting these signals, and since they
hadn't been successful in enlisting his
[SPEAKER_15]: voluntary silence, they fell back on a
wall of disinformation as the best way to
[SPEAKER_15]: confuse the issue and, ultimately,
to call his credibility into question.
[SPEAKER_15]: When the filmmaker appeared on the scene,
and it looked as if Paul's story might
[SPEAKER_15]: become part of the script, the
counterintelligence people simply extended
[SPEAKER_15]: their disinformation activities
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of this game involved a meeting
between the cattle mutilation researcher
[SPEAKER_15]: in question, Agent Richard Doty,
and others at the AFOSI office at Kirtland
[SPEAKER_15]: Air Force Base, wherein the researchers
subsequently claimed to have been allowed
[SPEAKER_15]: to view certain purportedly sensitive
documents about the government's alleged
[SPEAKER_15]: involvement with UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of this material included information
about an alleged UFO crash retrieval at
[SPEAKER_15]: Aztec.
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard Doty, who's bound by a security
oath, cannot and I am told will not
[SPEAKER_15]: discuss this matter, except to say that he
broke no laws and gave away no secrets
[SPEAKER_15]: that day.
[SPEAKER_15]: That, insofar as I'm aware, is entirely
correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, on the other hand, was never required
to sign a security oath, and am therefore
[SPEAKER_15]: breaking no laws when I tell you quite
candidly that the information which
[SPEAKER_15]: changed hands on that day was directly
descended from the discussion Doty and I
[SPEAKER_15]: had had only a few months earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can also tell you that it was a very
effective deception because the researcher
[SPEAKER_15]: involved continues to believe this
information and actively continues to try
[SPEAKER_15]: to convince others of its truth even now,
more than six years after the fact.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, there was no UFO crash at
Aztec, nor was there much truth to any of
[SPEAKER_15]: the other materials supplied to this
particular researcher, either at that
[SPEAKER_15]: meeting or during later encounters.
[SPEAKER_15]: The much touted alien harvest is really a
dismal crop failure.
[SPEAKER_15]: To the best of my knowledge, it was all
disinformation, and I was the unfortunate
[SPEAKER_15]: one who had unwittingly supplied the fuel
to those who were spreading the fire.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've held my silence on this matter for
more than six years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you know the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: Disinformation is a strange and bizarre
game.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who play it are completely aware
that an operation's success is dependent
[SPEAKER_15]: upon dropping information upon a target or
mark in such a way that the person will
[SPEAKER_15]: accept it as truth and will repeat and
even defend it to others as if it were
[SPEAKER_15]: true.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once this has been accomplished,
we certainly have a number of rude people
[SPEAKER_15]: in this audience.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once this has been accomplished,
the work of the counterintelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: specialist is complete, taken simply with
draw in the confidence that the dirty work
[SPEAKER_15]: of spreading their poison seeds will be
done by others.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who want proof of how well the
process works need only look around you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time one of you repeats an
unverified or unsubstantiated bit of
[SPEAKER_15]: information without qualifying it as such,
you are contributing to that process.
[SPEAKER_15]: And every time you do it, somebody in a
need-to-know position sits back and has a
[SPEAKER_15]: horse laugh at your expense.
[SPEAKER_15]: One final comment on the Aztec hoax is
that two other individuals who
[SPEAKER_15]: self-published a voluminous book,
UFO Crash at Aztec, on the affair in 1987,
[SPEAKER_15]: chose to completely omit any mention of my
extensive research on the case,
[SPEAKER_15]: which had been published two years earlier
and which both researchers had copies of.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a classic case of the book's
principal author having decided that his
[SPEAKER_15]: conclusion would be what his conclusion
would be before even beginning the process
[SPEAKER_15]: of investigating and then ignoring
everything which didn't fit.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the problems the ufology movement
has with its image is that there are a
[SPEAKER_15]: significant number of people involved with
it who not only support this sort of
[SPEAKER_15]: journalism, but encourage it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The next section of this presentation will
deal with questions and answers,
[SPEAKER_15]: but the format will be a bit different.
[SPEAKER_15]: In that I will not take questions from the
audience, but have elected to incorporate
[SPEAKER_15]: a number of questions and their answers
directly into the body of this paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question number one, am I currently
involved with providing information to any
[SPEAKER_15]: government agency about UFOs or about
people involved with the UFO phenomenon?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not had any such involvement since
1984.
[SPEAKER_09]: Frankly, I'm a little ashamed of some
people in this audience, regardless of
[SPEAKER_09]: what you believe, what you hear,
or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a debate.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a paper trying to be presented.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now please show a little courtesy.
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll repeat that question.
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I currently involved with providing
information to any government agency about
[SPEAKER_15]: UFOs or about people involved with the UFO
phenomenon?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not had any such involvement since
1984.
[SPEAKER_15]: The extent and the scope of that
involvement were essentially as I have
[SPEAKER_15]: already outlined to you and nothing more.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question two, am I presently involved in
knowingly spreading any sort of
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation about UFOs?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: The only conscious involvement I have ever
had with a disinformation operation was
[SPEAKER_15]: that which I have already outlined in
connection with the Benowitz case.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question three, am I presently or have I
ever been on the payroll of any agency of
[SPEAKER_15]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question four, what about my involvement
with UFO researcher Lee Graham?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, earlier in this paper,
I told you of how I was recruited to
[SPEAKER_15]: supply information on Mr. Benowitz in
1980.
[SPEAKER_15]: The exact wording of my statement was,
Benowitz and to a lesser extent,
[SPEAKER_15]: several other individuals.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of those other individuals was Lee
Graham.
[SPEAKER_15]: This began in 1983 if memory serves.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's important to note here that in
addition to being a UFO researcher,
[SPEAKER_15]: Lee is also an avid military aircraft
buff.
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as I'm aware, the
counterintelligence people were primarily
[SPEAKER_15]: interested in him because at the time Lee
was making a lot of inquiries and
[SPEAKER_15]: collecting a great deal of information on
the then very highly classified stealth
[SPEAKER_15]: aircraft program.
[SPEAKER_15]: Apparently there was some question as to
why he was so interested in obtaining
[SPEAKER_15]: information on so sensitive a subject.
[SPEAKER_15]: In other words, was he using it solely to
satisfy a personal curiosity or was he
[SPEAKER_15]: passing it on to others who perhaps had
foreign intelligence connections?
[SPEAKER_15]: There seemed to be only minimal interest
in his UFO activities.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lee is a completely aboveboard individual
who is a loyal U.S.
citizen.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the process of keeping in touch with
him, we became good friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: His knowledge of the fact that I had
friends in the intelligence community
[SPEAKER_15]: gradually evolved into the firm belief on
his part that I was much more than I
[SPEAKER_15]: really was.
[SPEAKER_15]: The ID card story, which has become the
subject of so much speculation lately,
[SPEAKER_15]: stems from nothing more than a practical
joke which has simply gotten out of hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: Since the story surrounding it is somewhat
longer than the time here will allow,
[SPEAKER_15]: I will commit to publishing it later in
our newsletter so that it will be on
[SPEAKER_15]: record for anyone interested in the facts.
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact is, I do not hold a government ID
card.
[SPEAKER_15]: But think about it for just one moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I did, does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_15]: That I'd pull it out of my wallet and show
it to Lee Graham or anybody else for that
[SPEAKER_15]: matter?
[SPEAKER_15]: Question five.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it true that several hours of
interviews with the source code named
[SPEAKER_15]: Falcon were videotaped, some in the
presence of bona fide members of the news
[SPEAKER_15]: media?
[SPEAKER_15]: And is it true, as some have alleged,
that those tapes were confiscated by the U
[SPEAKER_15]: .S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government?
[SPEAKER_13]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it is true that those tapes were
made.
[SPEAKER_15]: And no, it is not true that they were
confiscated.
[SPEAKER_15]: They are still in our possession.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question six.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it true that I've characterized the
cattle mutilation phenomenon as a hoax?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
No.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question seven.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I know anything about the so-called
Ellsworth Air Force Base humanoid case of
[SPEAKER_15]: 1977 and the documents associated with it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people have characterized this case
as a hoax, while others have attributed it
[SPEAKER_15]: to official disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my position that this was a special
counterintelligence training exercise in
[SPEAKER_15]: the creation and dissemination of
disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yes, Richard Doty, who was stationed
at Ellsworth at the time, was clearly a
[SPEAKER_15]: part of it, but not in any capacity where
he would have been responsible for
[SPEAKER_15]: creating the documents involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question eight.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I know anything about the so-called
Whitesill letter?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: The letter, which is loosely based upon an
actual UFO case, was written anonymously
[SPEAKER_15]: to APRO in July of 1998.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was written in 1980 by Richard Doty and
is directly related to the Benowitz
[SPEAKER_15]: affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: Essentially, it was bait.
[SPEAKER_15]: AFOSI knew that Benowitz had close ties
with the APRO organization at the time,
[SPEAKER_15]: and they were interested in recruiting
someone within the organization who would
[SPEAKER_15]: be in a position to provide them with
feedback on Benowitz's activities and
[SPEAKER_15]: communications.
[SPEAKER_15]: Since I was an APRO board member,
the Whitesill letter was passed to me for
[SPEAKER_15]: action shortly after it had been received.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was not long thereafter that I came to
know Richard Doty and began to provide him
[SPEAKER_15]: with information about Benowitz and his
case.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question nine.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do I know about the so-called
Aquarius document which purports to be a
[SPEAKER_15]: facsimile AFOSI message with a few
spurious additions?
[SPEAKER_15]: I neither typed nor retyped this document.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was created by AFOSI, or at least I
always assumed it was, and it was handed
[SPEAKER_15]: to me in February 1981 with the intention
that I would pass it to Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding, although I never knew
for sure, was that Benowitz was expected
[SPEAKER_15]: to wave it to the press and others as
proof of what he was saying about an alien
[SPEAKER_15]: invasion, at which point the document
would be denounced as a counterfeit and
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz would be further discredited.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately,
depending upon one's point of view,
[SPEAKER_15]: it didn't turn out that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: A highlighted version of this document
showing the real information and the added
[SPEAKER_15]: information appears in the current issue
of our newsletter, which will be available
[SPEAKER_15]: at our table out in the lobby.
[SPEAKER_15]: I might also add that the entire text of
this speech is also in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: One additional bit of information about
this document is the way that it came to
[SPEAKER_15]: be known to the UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: In September of 1982, insofar as I was
aware, there were only three copies of
[SPEAKER_15]: this document in existence.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of these I had given to Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: A second was in safekeeping and a third
was in my briefcase during a trip which I
[SPEAKER_15]: had made to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_15]: While there, I had a morning meeting with
a man who turned out later to be an
[SPEAKER_15]: associate of ufologist Peter Gerstin.
[SPEAKER_15]: That same afternoon, my car was broken
into and the briefcase was stolen.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a police report, by the way,
on file in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_15]: Four months later, a copy of that same
document complete with annotations I had
[SPEAKER_15]: penciled on it turned up in the hands of
none other than Gerstin himself.
[SPEAKER_15]: To this day, I have never received a
satisfactory explanation of how he
[SPEAKER_15]: obtained it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 10.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the AFOSI documents which speak
of a 1980 UFO landing near a nuclear
[SPEAKER_15]: storage facility within the Kirtland Air
Force Base complex?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are these documents more disinformation or
are they authentic?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, to the best of my knowledge,
they are authentic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 11.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about other documents which I have
either alluded to having or have published
[SPEAKER_15]: portions of without providing further
details?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, there are a number of these and
they came to us in several different ways.
[SPEAKER_15]: None of them, however, seem to have any
direct connection to the Benowitz case
[SPEAKER_15]: nor, as far as I can tell, was Richard
Doty directly involved in supplying them
[SPEAKER_15]: to us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether they are legitimate or
disinformation, they are more likely a
[SPEAKER_15]: combination of both is still a matter of
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 12.
[SPEAKER_15]: UFO basher Phil Klass has been the topic
of a number of rumors lately to the effect
[SPEAKER_15]: that he's an active government
disinformation agent.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do I think about that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, Mr. Klass is a very astute
individual who has long been a close
[SPEAKER_15]: follower of my activities.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, I believe he was the only one out
of the entire UFO community who managed to
[SPEAKER_15]: figure out what I and my associates were
up to and it horrified him.
[SPEAKER_15]: In my opinion, the very idea that someone
might actually be capable of getting far
[SPEAKER_15]: enough into the UFO problem to unmask his
debunking plans constituted a personal
[SPEAKER_15]: threat to him that had to be dealt with.
[SPEAKER_15]: He has been obsessed with doing everything
possible to try to either stop or
[SPEAKER_15]: discredit us ever since.
[SPEAKER_15]: The handout he passed around today to many
of you is just another example of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: As to his motives, I think it's best left
to Mr. Klass to explain why he behaves as
[SPEAKER_15]: he does.
[SPEAKER_15]: Perhaps Phil bashes UFOs and the people
who see them for the same reason that
[SPEAKER_15]: other people tear the wings off of flies.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or perhaps he gets well paid to do what he
does.
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's nothing to UFOs as he's
consistently claimed, then I can't imagine
[SPEAKER_15]: why he gets so emotional about them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless, of course,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's all part of the script.
[SPEAKER_15]: Phil's been bashing UFOs for over 20 years
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: In that process, he's always been very
quick to ascribe ulterior motives to the
[SPEAKER_15]: people who report them and investigate
them.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a lot of people in this audience
who would be very interested in hearing
[SPEAKER_15]: what his ulterior motives are.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why does Mr. Klass bash UFOs?
[SPEAKER_15]: I, for one, would welcome a rational
explanation of just why a man would devote
[SPEAKER_15]: 20 years of his life to an essentially
one-man crusade against something which he
[SPEAKER_15]: claims doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_15]: If he's not spreading disinformation,
if he's not on some government or private
[SPEAKER_15]: payroll, then just what is he up to and
precisely what does he hope to accomplish
[SPEAKER_15]: by it?
[SPEAKER_15]: How about it, folks?
[SPEAKER_15]: How many of you would like to hear what
makes Klass tick?
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he owes us all an explanation of
what, in my opinion, and I'm sure in that
[SPEAKER_15]: of many others, here has been 20 long
years of unprofessional attitude.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a matter of fact, I think he owes a lot
of people an apology, myself included.
[SPEAKER_15]: The newsletters are open to you,
Phil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whenever you're ready to explain yourself,
we'll be more than happy to print it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now having gotten that out of the way,
this seems to be an appropriate place to
[SPEAKER_15]: tell you the story of man's first contact
with the Martians.
[SPEAKER_15]: During a worldwide telecast of the Martian
Ambassadors Press Conference, the
[SPEAKER_15]: following dialogue transpired.
[SPEAKER_15]: Reporter.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me, Mr. Martian, what sort of social
structure do you have on Mars?
[SPEAKER_15]: Martian.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're all about communists.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no cares or worries in our
society, and we are all extremely happy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Reporter.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what's the one thing about living on
Mars that makes your people happy?
[SPEAKER_15]: Martian.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's a very easy question.
[SPEAKER_15]: You see, unlike the people on Earth,
we on Mars enjoy the distinct advantage of
[SPEAKER_15]: living in a completely classless society.
[SPEAKER_15]: So moving from the humorous back to the
serious, here's question 13.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do I think of Whitley Strieber and
his claims of being a UFO abductee?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: At first, I was highly skeptical and
admittedly somewhat jealous of Whitley.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a result, I undertook to get to know
the man in order to assess things for
[SPEAKER_15]: myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: In that process, he's earned my respect,
my admiration, and my friendship.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whitley has come very close to the truth
in a number of ways, and although still
[SPEAKER_15]: somewhat baffled by his own experiences,
he's found a very acceptable way of
[SPEAKER_15]: accommodating them into his life.
[SPEAKER_15]: If one makes a conscious effort to remove
Whitley's emotional reactions and then
[SPEAKER_15]: takes a hard look at the remaining core of
information, the result is an insightful
[SPEAKER_15]: look into what gives every appearance of
being a real situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any event, I certainly wouldn't dismiss
this man too lightly.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to hear a lot more from him
before it's all over.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 14.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jerome Clark reported in Fate magazine
that I and Jamie Chandere made a trip to
[SPEAKER_15]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_15]: in anticipation of meeting a live alien
and were stood up in the process.
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't this imply that we were highly
gullible individuals and that the
[SPEAKER_15]: experience was probably just a practical
joke on the part of the disinformation
[SPEAKER_15]: crowd?
[SPEAKER_11]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you stop to think about it,
considering what you now know of our
[SPEAKER_15]: project, and its goals, we had a story no
matter what happened.
[SPEAKER_15]: We made the trip because we simply
couldn't lose.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then there's more to that experience
than you know about.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, let me caution the hasty
pudding crowd not to jump to conclusions
[SPEAKER_15]: until all the facts are in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 15.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are my plans for the future?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I and my associates will continue our work
and will continue to keep you informed of
[SPEAKER_15]: our results as circumstances warrant.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you've heard today is only part of a
larger body of information.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 16.
[SPEAKER_15]: Assuming they're interested, what can
fellow ufologists do to support our
[SPEAKER_15]: continuing efforts?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, what we're doing takes a lot
of time and a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Money's not always available.
[SPEAKER_15]: The easiest thing you can do is to make
some contribution to the effort.
[SPEAKER_15]: If not in cash, which by no means do we
request, you might want to offer time,
[SPEAKER_15]: research services.
[SPEAKER_15]: You might have information which you feel
we might be interested in.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, feel free to contact us at
any time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Two years ago in Washington, D.C.,
I stated we were looking for help.
[SPEAKER_15]: The response was damn few offers and a lot
of rocks thrown in our direction.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can say to you now that at last
inventory we had plenty of rocks.
[SPEAKER_15]: We still need the help.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you that still have rocks to
throw, allow me to suggest that they might
[SPEAKER_15]: be put to better use by tossing them at
the rumor mongers or the disinformers or
[SPEAKER_15]: the incompetents.
[SPEAKER_15]: That are presently running rampant.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those people are the ones that are giving
us a bad image.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 17.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the so-called Blue Book 13
report?
[SPEAKER_10]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's best left up to those who are
circulating this material to provide the
[SPEAKER_15]: proof of its authenticity.
[SPEAKER_15]: I remain unconvinced of it, but
open-minded.
[SPEAKER_15]: Which brings me at last to the final
section of this lengthy paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems to me that it's high time I made
my position clear about a few things.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of people seem to be very interested
in knowing where Bill Moore stands.
[SPEAKER_15]: So here goes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me begin by stating that the positions
presented here are entirely my own.
[SPEAKER_15]: All are based upon evidence obtained by me
and by associates during the course of our
[SPEAKER_15]: project.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of that has been made available
already.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some is provided for the first time in
this paper, and some remains to be
[SPEAKER_15]: released at a later, more appropriate
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: As to the existence and depth of that
which is yet to be released, you'll just
[SPEAKER_15]: have to take my word for the time being.
[SPEAKER_15]: To the best of my knowledge, everything
here is true.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, although I confess to having
practiced an occasional deception now and
[SPEAKER_15]: again over the years in order to protect
the integrity of what I was doing,
[SPEAKER_15]: our goal from the very beginning was to
keep things as above board as possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: After all, ours is a search for answers,
not an effort to create more mysteries.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that a highly advanced extraterrestrial
civilization is visiting planet Earth and
[SPEAKER_15]: is actively manipulating our awareness of
their presence here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position number two.
[SPEAKER_15]: Elements of at least two of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government's intelligence agencies are
aware of this, and both are presently
[SPEAKER_15]: conducting highly classified ongoing
research projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you without reservation that at
least one of these efforts, and possibly
[SPEAKER_15]: both, has access to electromagnetic,
optical, and infrared signature data
[SPEAKER_15]: which, if released to the public,
would provide proof positive that some
[SPEAKER_15]: UFOs represent somebody else's highly
advanced technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I can't tell you more at
this time.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish I could.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you who find me competent and
credible will take this as a revelation,
[SPEAKER_15]: which is as it should be.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who hold other opinions will
continue to throw rocks while loudly
[SPEAKER_15]: demanding at the same time that I deliver
proof positive into their hands on a
[SPEAKER_15]: silver platter so that they can call it
their own and claim credit for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Patience, my friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position three.
[SPEAKER_15]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government counterintelligence people have
conducted an on-again, off-again campaign
[SPEAKER_15]: of deception and disinformation about the
UFO phenomenon for more than 40 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who have been responsible for such
operations are highly placed individuals
[SPEAKER_15]: within at least two separate agencies,
and there does seem to be a degree of
[SPEAKER_15]: cooperation between them.
[SPEAKER_15]: These operations involve a large number of
people and are well organized.
[SPEAKER_15]: They also include the use of phony
documents and the recruiting of informants
[SPEAKER_15]: who are able to provide information on the
activities of people conducting UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: research or who have had UFO experiences.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_15]: My experience suggests five.
[SPEAKER_15]: Different reasons.
[SPEAKER_15]: A.
[SPEAKER_15]: The disinformation provides security cover
for a real UFO project which exists at a
[SPEAKER_15]: very high level and is known only to an
elite few.
[SPEAKER_15]: B.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is also useful as part of a security
process designed to divert attention away
[SPEAKER_15]: from the real but non-UFO related high
tech research and development projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: C.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a manipulation by a group of highly
placed and well-to-do individuals like the
[SPEAKER_15]: trilateralists who espouse a one world
philosophy and who are using the UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: phenomenon in an effort to bring about
world unity in the face of an unknown
[SPEAKER_15]: threat from space.
[SPEAKER_15]: D.
[SPEAKER_15]: It provides a convenient way to train
counterintelligence agents in the
[SPEAKER_15]: techniques of deception and
disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: E.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a manipulation by UFO aliens
themselves as part of their plan to
[SPEAKER_15]: gradually make human society aware of
their presence.
[SPEAKER_15]: My position is that the truth is better.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether those people are witting or
unwitting tools of this process,
[SPEAKER_15]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Last thing, the disinformation people
expected, however, is that someone who
[SPEAKER_15]: knew of their activities with the Benowitz
affair would pop up after so many years
[SPEAKER_15]: and burst their balloon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position four.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been able to confirm that there is
in fact a group known as MJ-12 which
[SPEAKER_15]: operates at the White House National
Security Council level.
[SPEAKER_15]: To the best of my knowledge, this group
still uses MJ-12 as the designator.
[SPEAKER_15]: The level of security around this group is
such that we have not yet succeeded in
[SPEAKER_15]: establishing whether or not its functions
are UFO related or even precisely how long
[SPEAKER_15]: the group has existed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Along these same lines, none of our
sources has indicated any knowledge
[SPEAKER_15]: whatsoever with terms such as Maji,
Majesty, PI-40, Plato, Garnet,
[SPEAKER_15]: or a number of other terms currently being
spread by certain elements.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position five.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is in fact a Project Aquarius,
possibly two of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have succeeded in obtaining
considerable information about one such
[SPEAKER_15]: project in the 1971-73 time frame and
sketchy information about another,
[SPEAKER_15]: which may be a later extension of the
first one in the 1976-85 time frame.
[SPEAKER_15]: This information includes contract and
report numbers as well as the names of
[SPEAKER_15]: several individuals who worked on the
project.
[SPEAKER_15]: More details will be forthcoming later.
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwhile, it ill behooves UFO research
researchers to deluge the government with
[SPEAKER_15]: freedom of information requests for
details of sensitive high-level projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: This simply alerts the powers that be that
you are on to them and thus makes it all
[SPEAKER_15]: the more difficult to obtain information
through other channels.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the rush for me first in the UFO
community, we are often our own worst
[SPEAKER_15]: enemies.
[SPEAKER_15]: Discretion is the better part of valor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position six.
[SPEAKER_15]: With respect to the controversial MJ-12
papers, these have now been examined by a
[SPEAKER_15]: number of question documents experts and
other research on them is continuing as
[SPEAKER_15]: well as you've just heard from my friend
Stanton.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the case of the Cutler-Twining memo
found in the National Archives,
[SPEAKER_15]: I can state with reasonable certainty that
it is an authentic document and that best
[SPEAKER_15]: evidence indicates that someone planted
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's the papers of record group 341
knowing that there was a strong chance we
[SPEAKER_15]: would find it there.
[SPEAKER_15]: With respect to the so-called Eisenhower
briefing document, there is still no
[SPEAKER_15]: compelling reason to believe it is
anything but authentic.
[SPEAKER_15]: On the other hand, its authenticity
remains far from proved.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in the final analysis, the scale
remains balanced by the weight of
[SPEAKER_15]: arguments on both sides.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's the real thing, it's going to take
extraordinary evidence to convince even
[SPEAKER_15]: some of them are liberal skeptics.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's a hoax, it's extraordinarily well
done.
[SPEAKER_15]: Much better than the sort of
disinformation I encountered in connection
[SPEAKER_15]: with the Benowitz case.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, it still may be disinformation,
but then again it may not.
[SPEAKER_15]: Either way, there's a major story here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the controversy is far from over.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's real, it speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's disinformation, the equally
important story of why needs to be told.
[SPEAKER_15]: As for the so-called Truman Executive
Order of September 24, 1947, which is
[SPEAKER_15]: actually the final page of the portion of
the Eisenhower document which we have,
[SPEAKER_15]: the analysts have come up with mixed
results.
[SPEAKER_15]: Though not yet disproved, this document
presents the weakest case of the three.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are working on a final report on this
matter, which will include the results of
[SPEAKER_15]: typeface analysis and other processes.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be a lengthy affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: Before leaving it, however, I would like
to at least comment on what has emerged as
[SPEAKER_15]: the most controversial aspect of the MJ-12
document affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: That of the date format.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a couple of points I would like
to make.
[SPEAKER_15]: One, if the similarities between stylistic
characteristics of the documents and my
[SPEAKER_15]: own writings are important, as some have
claimed, then are not dissimilarities
[SPEAKER_15]: equally important?
[SPEAKER_15]: There are some, you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even in the way the dates are written,
why do those who go to such pains to point
[SPEAKER_15]: out similarities not go to equal pains to
point out dissimilarities, especially when
[SPEAKER_15]: they claim to be using the scientific
method?
[SPEAKER_15]: Could it, I wonder, be prejudiced?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or does the word incompetence better
describe it?
[SPEAKER_15]: We are by no means convinced that the date
format is as critical an issue as others
[SPEAKER_15]: would make it out to be.
[SPEAKER_15]: While the style is admittedly unusual,
it is not without precedent.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that, of course, is the bottom line,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Three, to those of you who still harbor
suspicions that I created the documents
[SPEAKER_15]: and am perpetrating a hoax, I say thank
you for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_15]: To those of you who think it more likely
that I am the innocent victim of an
[SPEAKER_15]: elaborate hoax, I concede that this
remains a possibility which has not yet
[SPEAKER_15]: been entirely ruled out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position seven.
[SPEAKER_15]: The matter of alien abductions of humans
is apparently regarded as serious by those
[SPEAKER_15]: within the government who are aware of the
extraterrestrial nature of UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is evidenced by the fact that the
government has gone so far as to disinform
[SPEAKER_15]: its own counterintelligence people on that
very subject.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position eight.
[SPEAKER_15]: The secret behind the government UFO
cover-up is essentially an awareness of
[SPEAKER_15]: what UFOs are by a few people in high
places who have connections with the
[SPEAKER_15]: National Security Council and the White
House.
[SPEAKER_15]: Widespread publicity about the abduction
phenomenon is an error in what is already
[SPEAKER_15]: a difficult situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Within the in-group, there are strong
differences of opinion as to whether
[SPEAKER_15]: information should be released to the
public and how fast.
[SPEAKER_15]: There seems to be some consternation about
exactly who is in control of the
[SPEAKER_15]: situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position nine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ufology has been stumbling around for 30
years looking for answers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless something is done to reduce the
petty bickering, the rumor-mongering,
[SPEAKER_15]: the name-calling, the ego-massaging,
the power politics, and the personal
[SPEAKER_15]: vendettas which have been taking up our
time, sapping our strength, and disgracing
[SPEAKER_15]: our image lately, I expect mainstream
ufology will go right on stumbling for a
[SPEAKER_15]: long time to come.
[SPEAKER_15]: What is needed?
[SPEAKER_15]: I submit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is a society of professional ufologists
which adheres to established research
[SPEAKER_15]: procedures and techniques which maintains
a rigorous set of ethics and standards in
[SPEAKER_15]: which limits its membership to a few whose
competence has been appropriately
[SPEAKER_15]: demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter what happens, however,
I am committed to completing the process I
[SPEAKER_15]: have begun.
[SPEAKER_15]: I am presently working with a network of
more than a dozen individuals.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of whom hold some very impressive
credentials.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been actively exploring the
labyrinth of government UFO involvement,
[SPEAKER_15]: and we will continue to do so until we
feel the task is complete or that we can
[SPEAKER_15]: go no further.
[SPEAKER_15]: Our group is euphemistically called the
aviary, and each individual uses the code
[SPEAKER_15]: name of a bird as an identifier.
[SPEAKER_15]: We will continue to provide the UFO
community with data, and we will continue
[SPEAKER_15]: to proceed in a way which we feel best
suits our purposes.
[SPEAKER_15]: A number of people have suggested to me
recently that I should defend myself
[SPEAKER_15]: against various allegations and rumors
which have been circulating lately.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, folks, you've just heard the case
for the defense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now reach down inside of yourselves and
wrench forth a judgment.
[SPEAKER_15]: I and my group of associates are going to
find some answers, no matter what it takes
[SPEAKER_15]: and no matter how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are out there digging, and we are going
to continue to dig, either with the
[SPEAKER_15]: support of the UFO community or without
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Armchair researchers and hasty-putting
pot-shot plagiarist ufologists whose only
[SPEAKER_15]: goal is to make themselves look important
at others' expense, take note.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you who think we're doing a good
job and want to be part of that process,
[SPEAKER_15]: please know that we welcome any support
you feel you can offer, even if we've had
[SPEAKER_15]: personal differences between us in the
past.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who feel it's all a con game or that
it's all disinformation can continue to
[SPEAKER_15]: throw all the rocks you want.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go right on without you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just as we always have.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish to state that the text you've just
heard me read is copyrighted.
[SPEAKER_15]: As such, any use of printed video or audio
reproductions of this material without
[SPEAKER_15]: permission is prohibited.
[SPEAKER_15]: And finally, this paper marks a radical
change of position for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the past, I've always been very careful
to qualify my statements about the
[SPEAKER_15]: possible extraterrestrial nature of UFOs
so as to leave room for other
[SPEAKER_15]: explanations.
[SPEAKER_15]: While the evidence that my associates and
I have accumulated to date, however,
[SPEAKER_15]: boils down to two inescapable conclusions.
[SPEAKER_15]: First, there is an extraterrestrial
presence here on planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And second, a small number of individuals
within our government know it but remain
[SPEAKER_15]: undecided as to what to do about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: These two things represent the bottom
line.
[SPEAKER_15]: From there, it's only a question of
uncovering just how much of the rest of
[SPEAKER_15]: the UFO story is for real and how much of
it is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is precisely what we intend to do.
[SPEAKER_15]: So either climb aboard and hang on or get
off the tracks.
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize for having taken so long.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I've offended, that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I have tried to be truthful with you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a lot to say, and it needed to be
said.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, good night, and farewell.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a little rough from time to time.
[SPEAKER_27]: So if I offend, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_27]: But unfortunately, that's the way I am.
[SPEAKER_27]: First of all, before I begin, I would like
to thank very much Mr. John Lear for
[SPEAKER_27]: making it possible for me to be here at
this conference.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did not know whether or not I would be
able to make it, and John made that
[SPEAKER_27]: possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: And he has my deepest gratitude because
I've been looking forward for an
[SPEAKER_27]: opportunity like this for almost 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_27]: And also, I'd like to thank the other
speakers who very graciously donated some
[SPEAKER_27]: of their time to allow me to speak.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_27]: And in 45 minutes, I have to condense 12
years of information and happenings.
[SPEAKER_27]: What I would like to do is speak for 30
minutes and then for 15 minutes,
[SPEAKER_27]: accept questions from the floor.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'd like to make a promise to you at
this point that unlike certain people,
[SPEAKER_27]: I will not try to treat you like mushrooms
by keeping you in the dark and feeding you
[SPEAKER_27]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that during the question and answer
period, I will not ask myself questions
[SPEAKER_27]: and answer them for you.
[SPEAKER_27]: Give you a little background about myself.
[SPEAKER_27]: In 1976, while working for the United
States government at RAF Chick-Sands,
[SPEAKER_27]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_27]: Air Force Base Security Services Command
in Bedford, England, as a data analyst,
[SPEAKER_27]: I had the occasion to view a document
entitled Grudge Blue Book Report Number
[SPEAKER_27]: 13.
[SPEAKER_27]: Those of you who are aware of the history
of Blue Book know that Grudge Blue Book or
[SPEAKER_27]: Blue Book Report Number 13 is a document
that the government has sworn for years
[SPEAKER_27]: does not exist.
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I'm here to tell you, ladies and
gentlemen, that's crap.
[SPEAKER_27]: It does exist.
[SPEAKER_27]: While employed by the government and
fulfilling my duties, I analyzed that
[SPEAKER_27]: document.
[SPEAKER_27]: I read it very carefully.
[SPEAKER_27]: Over 600 pages.
[SPEAKER_27]: Over half of that was photographs.
[SPEAKER_27]: The content of that document consisted
largely of technical reports, autopsy
[SPEAKER_27]: reports, and photographs of alien beings,
alien technology, and unsundry other
[SPEAKER_27]: things, which I will get into.
[SPEAKER_27]: And at this point, I would like to make
mention that I find myself in a very,
[SPEAKER_27]: very poor position, which I am not
entirely happy with because I'm being
[SPEAKER_27]: forced to do something I swore up and down
I would never do.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that is respond to last night's
speaker, Mr. Bill Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I will do that after I give you a
brief rundown of the Blue Book 13 report.
[SPEAKER_27]: The version of the document that I saw was
an annotated version.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Cooper saw his version of the document
in the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_27]: I saw my version of the same document in
the mid 70s.
[SPEAKER_27]: My version of the document had been
expanded considerably.
[SPEAKER_27]: A large portion of the document consisted
largely of photographs.
[SPEAKER_27]: Photographs which showed alien beings
alive and dead.
[SPEAKER_27]: Micro photography photographs of tissue
samples, lab reports of fluid samples,
[SPEAKER_27]: analytical data from the findings of
tests, technical data concerning craft,
[SPEAKER_27]: power units, and possibly weapons.
[SPEAKER_27]: The general tone of the document itself
was geared basically toward defense.
[SPEAKER_27]: How would we defend against something like
this?
[SPEAKER_27]: How would we defend against the technology
that was obvious and that was shown and
[SPEAKER_27]: reported upon in the document?
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, for the past 12 years, eight of which
I was in hiding,
[SPEAKER_27]: I have been called a liar.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have been called a drug addict,
a pervert, a psychotic, you name it,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I've been called it.
[SPEAKER_27]: According to some, I am probably the most
perverted son of a bitch you will meet in
[SPEAKER_27]: the entire world.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_27]: After 12 years, I've become a little bit
hard-shelled about the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I don't particularly care.
[SPEAKER_27]: But there's something we have to
understand.
[SPEAKER_27]: As a group of investigators, as a group of
interested people, we have to cut through
[SPEAKER_27]: the crap.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to pull together as a unified
force and forget personalities,
[SPEAKER_27]: forget character assassination,
forget all of the politics that exist
[SPEAKER_27]: within organizations, and unite in order
to find the answers that we need to find.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to do this.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's imperative.
[SPEAKER_27]: Part of our problem right now is we don't
even know what the questions are.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to cooperate with one another.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of you have read John Lear's
interview with me in Virginia of last
[SPEAKER_27]: year.
[SPEAKER_27]: In which he outlined much of what I've
been saying for the past 12 years.
[SPEAKER_27]: I would suggest that you get a copy of
this if you do not have it and read it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Simple fact of the matter is, is I can't
tell you any more than has already been
[SPEAKER_27]: published in things like UFO Crash at
Aztec by Bill Steinman and Wendell
[SPEAKER_27]: Stevens, or what has been published by
John Lear.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_27]: And most of you, I'm sure, have touched
upon the report or read the report and
[SPEAKER_27]: what was in the report.
[SPEAKER_27]: Unfortunately, I'm faced with a dilemma at
this point, and that dilemma is this.
[SPEAKER_27]: I came here last night to listen to Mr.
Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I came here with the idea of being
open-minded, as I possibly could,
[SPEAKER_27]: understanding that people are entitled to
their own opinion, their own feeling,
[SPEAKER_27]: for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_27]: But there's a part of me that objects very
strongly to being lied to.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's exactly what happened last
night.
[SPEAKER_27]: You were lied to.
[SPEAKER_27]: We sat up here in the audience and
listened to a man expound on stuff.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was absolute utter hogwash.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, some of you are sitting out there
saying, how can this be true?
[SPEAKER_27]: Why is it hogwash?
[SPEAKER_27]: He's a respected investigator.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's been in the business for a long time.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's published a book.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's published a couple of books.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, he has.
[SPEAKER_27]: His Roswell incident set new precedents
for investigation in the UFO field,
[SPEAKER_27]: and he needs to be commended for it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I admire him for it.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an excellent book.
[SPEAKER_27]: He broke new ground for UFO investigators.
[SPEAKER_27]: What happened after that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_27]: You heard Mr. Moore stand up here and say
in 1980 or 1981, he was approached and
[SPEAKER_27]: given information by Falcon or Condor or
whatever the buzzard's name was.
[SPEAKER_27]: That was a lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was an absolute lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know it was a lie because in 1979,
one month after Mr. Moore arrived in the
[SPEAKER_27]: state of Arizona, thanks to Mr. Alan Benz,
formerly of APRO, now for the Foundation
[SPEAKER_27]: of UFO Research, Mr. Moore and I met,
at which point I realized I related my
[SPEAKER_27]: information to Mr. Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: We met not once, but twice.
[SPEAKER_27]: Several months later, Mr. Moore came to
me, my place of business, a little place
[SPEAKER_27]: called Trail Dust Town off Tanker Verde
Road in Tucson, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_27]: We went across the street to a little
place called the Parfait Palace.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had a bowl of chili.
[SPEAKER_27]: He had a cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had heartburn, and he had brain burn.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Moore sat there for two hours,
and we conversed.
[SPEAKER_27]: We discussed what I had related to him to
begin with in the Blue Book documents.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think, ostensibly, what he was
trying to do was to see if he could catch
[SPEAKER_27]: me at a lie, see if I would tell him the
same thing I told him before, which is
[SPEAKER_27]: fine.
[SPEAKER_27]: Any good investigator would do that.
[SPEAKER_27]: But somewhere along the line, Mr. Moore
twisted it around.
[SPEAKER_27]: At that time, I had been discussing with
Mr. Jerry Schultz, who had been passing
[SPEAKER_27]: through APRO, and apparently had been
passing through APRO for several years at
[SPEAKER_27]: that point, with his bicycle and his
little pup tent, some of the implications
[SPEAKER_27]: of what had been going on.
[SPEAKER_27]: Quite literally, whenever I was in the
APRO office, Mr. Schultz was in the APRO
[SPEAKER_27]: office, and he grilled me extensively.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Moore asked my opinion of Mr. Schultz.
[SPEAKER_27]: At that time, being fairly conservative
and not as liberal as I am these days,
[SPEAKER_27]: I expressed the opinion that I thought Mr.
Schultz was a bit different.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Moore brought up the question of
drugs, to which I responded, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: Anything's possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did not know the man well.
[SPEAKER_27]: I never did know the man well,
contrary to what you might have heard from
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Schultz himself.
[SPEAKER_27]: We were never close, never have been
close.
[SPEAKER_27]: Very shortly after that, due to
circumstances which got a little bit out
[SPEAKER_27]: of control with regard to my activity and
investigation, and the fact that very
[SPEAKER_27]: suddenly there were serious attempts
against my life, it became appropriate for
[SPEAKER_27]: me to disappear, at which point I went
into hiding for eight years.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yesterday marked the first anniversary of
me resurfacing into the UFO investigative
[SPEAKER_27]: community.
[SPEAKER_27]: Today marks the 13th anniversary of my
viewing of the Grudge Blue Book Report
[SPEAKER_27]: Number 13.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thirteen years ago today, in 1976,
I viewed that document, and my life went
[SPEAKER_27]: to hell in a hand card.
[SPEAKER_27]: As a result of viewing that document,
as I digress a little bit, I lost a wife
[SPEAKER_27]: and two kids.
[SPEAKER_27]: I reported to work, as I normally do,
at security services command at RAF
[SPEAKER_27]: Chick-Sands.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was immediately told to report to the
base commander's office on base,
[SPEAKER_27]: which I did, where I met Colonel Robert
Black, then base commander at RAF
[SPEAKER_27]: Chick-Sands.
[SPEAKER_27]: Colonel Black called me into his office
and informed me that I was being
[SPEAKER_27]: discharged from my job, and that I was
being deported from the country as
[SPEAKER_27]: undesirable element.
[SPEAKER_27]: No explanation, no reason, that was it.
[SPEAKER_27]: It took me several months after my return
to the United States to finally determine
[SPEAKER_27]: what had happened.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was not allowed to say goodbye to my
wife or children who remained in England,
[SPEAKER_27]: who remained at RAF Chick-Sands for
another five years, where she taught
[SPEAKER_27]: school, at the RAF Chick-Sands Dependent
School.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have not seen my wife and sons in 12
years.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have not heard from them in two years.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have discovered, ultimately,
that she was transferred to another Air
[SPEAKER_27]: Force base in England, where she teaches
school still.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was not allowed to communicate with her
in any way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was not allowed to tell her what was
going on, why it was going on.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did discover later that she had been
told that I'd just walked in and quit and
[SPEAKER_27]: left the country, and left her.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_25]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not true, but that's what she was
told.
[SPEAKER_27]: And any woman in her right mind who's left
high and dry with two kids to take care
[SPEAKER_27]: of, is going to think the worst.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_27]: Ultimately, after about 10 years,
I divorced my wife, feeling that there was
[SPEAKER_27]: no way I could possibly salvage a
marriage, and that after such a long
[SPEAKER_27]: separation, she had changed and I had
changed, and I decided it was time to get
[SPEAKER_27]: on with my life.
[SPEAKER_27]: Ultimately, two years ago, I married a
very wonderful lady with two kids of her
[SPEAKER_27]: own.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm quite happy, and it looks like this
marriage will last a long time.
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope it will, because she's about the
only person I know that can put up with my
[SPEAKER_27]: shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_27]: She deserves a lot of credit, and I'd like
you to know that she supports me,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I wouldn't be able to do what I'm
doing today without her support.
[SPEAKER_27]: During the last 12 years, there have been
over 15 attempts on my life.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have been shot at.
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been stabbed.
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been blown up.
[SPEAKER_27]: I've contracted food poisoning.
[SPEAKER_27]: All the little things that are geared to
look like nice little accidents.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, some of you will say, well,
if you were in such a secure position
[SPEAKER_27]: while you were hiding, why did you come
back out?
[SPEAKER_27]: I was employed at a radio station in
Lynchburg, Virginia, WLBA, stereo 59.
[SPEAKER_27]: By this time, John Lear had tried to
contact my father.
[SPEAKER_27]: My father is William J.
[SPEAKER_27]: English, Speaker of the House of
Representatives for the State of Arizona.
[SPEAKER_27]: My father, being somewhat aware of my
desire to maintain my anonymity,
[SPEAKER_27]: denied my existence to John, had his
secretary deny my existence.
[SPEAKER_27]: And John, bless his heart, persisted.
[SPEAKER_27]: Persisted to the point where my father's
secretary was so worked up and so upset,
[SPEAKER_27]: my father decided to forward John's phone
number and a terse little note saying that
[SPEAKER_27]: he did not tell John where I was at or how
to get in contact with me, and I damn well
[SPEAKER_27]: better take care of it because he was
getting tired of it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I learned a long time ago, it's not wise
to cross my father.
[SPEAKER_27]: He has a nasty habit of getting what he
wants.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I didn't respond to it immediately for
two reasons.
[SPEAKER_27]: One, I did not know John Lear.
[SPEAKER_27]: And two, I really didn't feel that it was
necessary at that point for me to come out
[SPEAKER_27]: of the closet and announce that the rumors
of my demise were exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_27]: At this point, I would like to take the
opportunity, I don't know if Mr. Andrus is
[SPEAKER_27]: here, but I would like to take the
opportunity to thank Mr. Andrus because
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Andrus is directly responsible for me
contacting Wendell Stevens.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Andrus made a statement to ABC News,
I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_27]: The statement was so out of character for
what I knew from Walt Andrus that I had to
[SPEAKER_27]: consider it very carefully.
[SPEAKER_27]: While working at the radio station,
I had the opportunity to view the
[SPEAKER_27]: pre-feeds that Network sends down to radio
stations.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that you'll have an idea of what is
going to come down the network news.
[SPEAKER_27]: In that statement, Mr. Andrus said that
there are aliens on earth, that we have
[SPEAKER_27]: been invaded, and that they are here.
[SPEAKER_27]: I found this extremely out of character
for what I knew of Mr. Andrus.
[SPEAKER_27]: He was not the conservative person that I
had known, certainly wasn't the person
[SPEAKER_27]: that had been described to me by Coral
Lorenzen, which I might add at that time
[SPEAKER_27]: was not complimentary at all.
[SPEAKER_27]: But shortly thereafter, I was on Coral's
list also, so it didn't matter much.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I knew that I had made it wherever
made it was because I was at the top of
[SPEAKER_27]: her list of people to avoid and to hate.
[SPEAKER_27]: I might add at this point, I have the
dubious honor of being the only person
[SPEAKER_27]: that Coral has tried to sue.
[SPEAKER_27]: When Coral did that, I knew then and there
that I had reached the top.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I will say this of Coral and Jim
Lorenzen, they have my honor.
[SPEAKER_27]: They have my admiration.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever my personal feelings about Jim
and Coral Lorenzen might be, they had the
[SPEAKER_27]: courage to do something that nobody else
did, and they were the very first.
[SPEAKER_27]: Their work made it possible for all of you
to be here today, and for that I am
[SPEAKER_27]: eternally grateful.
[SPEAKER_27]: To continue, and I apologize for
digressing and going off into tangents,
[SPEAKER_27]: but that's the way I am.
[SPEAKER_27]: I read the statement that Mr. Andrus had
made on the wire service, and I said this
[SPEAKER_27]: can't be right.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't believe this.
[SPEAKER_27]: After so many years, somebody of repute
came forward and said, yes, it's true.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was like a load was lifted off my
back.
[SPEAKER_27]: That very night I contacted Wendell
Stevens and said, Wendell, he said,
[SPEAKER_27]: yes.
[SPEAKER_27]: Who the hell are you?
[SPEAKER_27]: Bill English.
[SPEAKER_27]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_27]: No, really, it's Bill English,
Wendell.
[SPEAKER_27]: Where the hell are you?
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_27]: Virginia?
[SPEAKER_27]: I heard you were dead.
[SPEAKER_27]: We thought you were dead.
[SPEAKER_27]: Where have you been?
[SPEAKER_27]: So I rehashed the scenario with Wendell,
Wendell being a little bit more aware of
[SPEAKER_27]: what the circumstances were at the time
and why I disappeared, could understand
[SPEAKER_27]: it.
[SPEAKER_27]: He told me, you know, you're in a book.
[SPEAKER_27]: To which I responded, no shit.
[SPEAKER_27]: Said, yeah, a fellow by the name of Bill
Steinman and I wrote a book.
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I helped him.
[SPEAKER_27]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_27]: How do I get a copy of the book?
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I'll send you one.
[SPEAKER_27]: Say, can I tell anybody that you're still
there?
[SPEAKER_27]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want anybody to know I'm here.
[SPEAKER_27]: Send me the book and I'll talk to you.
[SPEAKER_27]: Several days later, I received the book in
the mail and I sat down and read it.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I was greatly disturbed at what I
read.
[SPEAKER_27]: Not because what was in the book was a
lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_27]: The information that was in the book was
extremely accurate.
[SPEAKER_27]: Wendell had very faithfully seen to it
that all the information was there.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was disturbed because after so many
years I was forced to sit down and
[SPEAKER_27]: remember the circumstances that brought me
to that point in my life.
[SPEAKER_27]: I then sat down with my wife and said,
Valerie, I want you to read this.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is who I am.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's finally come out in the open.
[SPEAKER_27]: She read it.
[SPEAKER_27]: She said, is it true?
[SPEAKER_27]: I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_27]: Then she said, what are you going to do
about it?
[SPEAKER_27]: What are we going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_27]: I said, well, what should we do about it?
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_27]: I said, well, boy, you better get off your
ass and get out there and start talking
[SPEAKER_27]: about it because it's obvious somebody out
there knows what's going on and they had
[SPEAKER_27]: better get the straight information.
[SPEAKER_27]: And when she said that, I fell in love
with that lady all over again.
[SPEAKER_27]: She had more courage than I did.
[SPEAKER_27]: Either that or she was extremely naive.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I like to think she was courageous.
[SPEAKER_27]: So after reading the book and going
through all that, I finally contacted John
[SPEAKER_27]: Lear.
[SPEAKER_27]: First time I contacted him, I posed as
Bill English's lawyer.
[SPEAKER_27]: Called him up and said, I'm Mr. English's
lawyer, legal attorney.
[SPEAKER_27]: He told me to contact you and find out
what the hell you want.
[SPEAKER_27]: John told the lawyer what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_27]: He was very honest, very straightforward
about it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I thanked him, hung up.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then I didn't call him back for about
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I considered everything.
[SPEAKER_27]: Finally, at the end of two weeks,
I called him back.
[SPEAKER_27]: We talked for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_27]: He asked if he could meet me in person.
[SPEAKER_27]: I said yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had a great inconvenience to him and at
much expense, he flew to Virginia to meet
[SPEAKER_27]: me where I met him at the Lynchburg
airport.
[SPEAKER_27]: Immediately upon his arrival for the first
time in eight years, we were followed.
[SPEAKER_27]: The government knew where I was at.
[SPEAKER_27]: John came into the airport terminal.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was wearing a beard, grubby old Levi's,
the blue vest that many of you have seen
[SPEAKER_27]: me walking around in the last few days,
my lucky vest.
[SPEAKER_27]: He sat down.
[SPEAKER_27]: He had no idea what I looked like.
[SPEAKER_27]: I sat down next to him, waited for a
couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_27]: Turned around and looked at him and said,
you can buy me a drink.
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_27]: And John, being the trooper that he is,
didn't say a word.
[SPEAKER_27]: Got up, grabbed his bag, walked out the
door.
[SPEAKER_27]: Our trails followed us out the door.
[SPEAKER_27]: We jumped in John's car and headed to a
local bar where John bought me a drink.
[SPEAKER_27]: Two gentlemen followed us into the bar.
[SPEAKER_27]: John and I scooted out of the bar and
headed from my home.
[SPEAKER_27]: The next few days, John,
[SPEAKER_27]: very graciously but very thoroughly
grilled me, reminded me of things that I
[SPEAKER_27]: had not remembered for many years.
[SPEAKER_27]: My chief concern when I spoke to Mr. Lear
was I did not know him and I did not want
[SPEAKER_27]: to come off as an idiot.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did not want him to think that I was
another nutcase.
[SPEAKER_27]: It wasn't until about a month later when
Mr. Lear sent me a copy of his report on
[SPEAKER_27]: meeting with me that I finally had an idea
of what he thought of me.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I was deeply gratified to see that he
believed me.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Lear is officially retiring from
active UFO investigations.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I cry for it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Objectively, he has not been in the field
for very long, but what he has done has
[SPEAKER_27]: been phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Lear is perhaps one of the finest men
I know.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever else you might think of him as an
investigator, as a controversial figure,
[SPEAKER_27]: as a human being, the man has heart.
[SPEAKER_27]: And there's damn few of us anymore that
can say that about anybody.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now that I've covered, for the most part,
what I've had to say with regard to
[SPEAKER_27]: reviewing some of the circumstances which
have brought me here tonight, it's now
[SPEAKER_27]: necessary for me to address the question
of Mr. Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: Last night, Mr. Moore stood up here and
said, we must stop the character
[SPEAKER_27]: assassination.
[SPEAKER_27]: We must stop the infighting.
[SPEAKER_27]: We must stop the disinformation.
[SPEAKER_27]: And as he was saying that, I was walking
around the back of this auditorium about
[SPEAKER_27]: ready to pop a court because the man was
standing there telling you a bald-faced
[SPEAKER_27]: lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: He has not stopped the character
assassination, and he never did.
[SPEAKER_27]: Nine months ago, when Mr. Moore discovered
that I had resurfaced, he was asked by two
[SPEAKER_27]: engineers from Aerojet Corporation what he
thought of me and my viewing of the
[SPEAKER_27]: documents that I said I had viewed.
[SPEAKER_27]: To which he responded, Bill English told
me that he and Jerry Schultz were doing
[SPEAKER_27]: LSD when they wrote the Blue Book
summation.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a documented fact.
[SPEAKER_27]: Bill did, in fact, say this, and I have a
letter from him stating, and he said it,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I have that letter here today.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's in the possession of Mr. John Lear
because I gave it to him yesterday
[SPEAKER_27]: morning.
[SPEAKER_27]: That statement is an out and out lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: I never made such a statement to Mr.
Moore.
[SPEAKER_27]: In fact, I do not do drugs.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a hard time taking drugs,
even those prescribed by the doctor.
[SPEAKER_27]: I said nothing at that point because I
wanted to wait and see what else was going
[SPEAKER_27]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_27]: Then Mr. Moore came out with that Bukaka
UFO television show of his, which in my
[SPEAKER_27]: estimation was designed to do nothing more
than discredit the science of ufology.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's exactly what it did.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was poorly produced.
[SPEAKER_27]: Poorly written.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it made UFO investigators look like
absolute utter idiots.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was the cruelest blow that anybody
could have hit UFO investigators with.
[SPEAKER_27]: To add insult to injury, Mr. Moore had his
two buzzards pronounced
[SPEAKER_27]: the stuff that he said I'd been lying
about for 13 years.
[SPEAKER_27]: Word for word, they parroted everything
that I had told him in 1979.
[SPEAKER_27]: One hour after viewing this travesty,
I got on the telephone to Alan Benz and
[SPEAKER_27]: got Mr. Moore's phone number.
[SPEAKER_27]: Alan is here tonight.
[SPEAKER_27]: He will confirm this.
[SPEAKER_27]: Bill was in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_27]: I spoke with Mr. Chandra.
[SPEAKER_27]: I told Mr. Chandra that I wanted a piece
of Mr. Moore's ass so bad I was ready to
[SPEAKER_27]: crawl through the phone and bite him on
the ear.
[SPEAKER_27]: I told Mr. Chandra that that show was
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_27]: That a man who for 12 years had said that
Bill English is a liar and a drug addict
[SPEAKER_27]: and a paranoid schizophrenic and every
kind of perverse son of a bitch that you
[SPEAKER_27]: can imagine, produced a television show
that parroted everything that I had been
[SPEAKER_17]: saying for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_27]: My question at that time was, if I'm such
a liar, why would you produce a piece of
[SPEAKER_27]: crap like this and have someone say that?
[SPEAKER_27]: My question now is, after producing that
piece of shit, why would you stand in
[SPEAKER_27]: front of an audience of qualified,
intelligent people and tell them that it
[SPEAKER_27]: was a disinformation ploy?
[SPEAKER_27]: Another lie.
[SPEAKER_27]: Quite frankly, if Mr. Moore is not in this
for the money, then what the hell is he in
[SPEAKER_27]: it for?
[SPEAKER_27]: He's not done any good for UFO
investigation that I can determine,
[SPEAKER_18]: except hurt it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I would like to take this opportunity
right now to apologize to you and to those
[SPEAKER_27]: of you who support Mr. Moore, but facts
are facts.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever you may think of me,
[SPEAKER_27]: tomorrow morning I will get up and wash my
face and go to the bathroom and put my
[SPEAKER_27]: pants on just like most of you do.
[SPEAKER_27]: I will be here tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of you came to this meeting today
saying we are going to get some answers
[SPEAKER_27]: and I apologize to you because I don't
have any answers for you.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't even know what the questions are
anymore.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do know that we as a body must pull
together not only in MUFONs, but in CUFOs,
[SPEAKER_27]: Center for International UFO Studies.
[SPEAKER_27]: All of the UFO organizations that are in
existence today must put aside their
[SPEAKER_27]: political aspirations, must put aside the
politics of their organization,
[SPEAKER_27]: must put aside their personal feelings.
[SPEAKER_27]: We must.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's imperative that we are going to
accomplish anything.
[SPEAKER_27]: This has long been my central repository
of records and information.
[SPEAKER_27]: Do it in such a manner that all
organizations can access the information.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thanks to a gentleman by the name of Mr.
Richard Scheffler out of Alamogordo,
[SPEAKER_27]: New Mexico, that dream has come true.
[SPEAKER_27]: In the last two months we have established
a computerized news and information
[SPEAKER_27]: service devoted strictly to UFO
information.
[SPEAKER_27]: Quality UFO information.
[SPEAKER_27]: The information that goes into this board
will be approved by a board of approval.
[SPEAKER_27]: Consisting of several investigators of
renown who are in fact members of various
[SPEAKER_27]: UFO organizations.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of the members of this board do not
like each other.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of the members of this board do not
agree with each other.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many of the members of this board hate
each other's guts.
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever your opinions and personal
conflicts might be, the members of this
[SPEAKER_27]: board are charged with the duty of
checking over whatever information is
[SPEAKER_27]: submitted to the UFINET bulletin board for
content investigative technique.
[SPEAKER_27]: We do not editorialize.
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever is submitted will be put on the
computer exactly as it was submitted.
[SPEAKER_27]: There will be no deletions.
[SPEAKER_27]: There will be no editorial comment added
to it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_27]: What you see will be the original
document.
[SPEAKER_27]: It is my hope that we as an organization
of human beings can gather together and
[SPEAKER_27]: use this service to find the
disinformation, to make a determination as
[SPEAKER_27]: to what is true or not true, employ
scientific technique in the investigation
[SPEAKER_27]: of UFOs, and establish a firmer,
more solid foundation for this science of
[SPEAKER_27]: ours.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's exactly what this is.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a science.
[SPEAKER_27]: We have no established criteria per se for
investigators, but we hope eventually that
[SPEAKER_27]: will take place, and that ufology will be
recognized as a genuine bona fide field.
[SPEAKER_27]: For those of you who are not aware of my
particular situation, it's time for the
[SPEAKER_27]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_27]: I have on sale and front a situation and
update report.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you would like, please come there.
[SPEAKER_27]: Right now I'd like to open up the floor to
questions.
[SPEAKER_27]: If there's anybody who has a question,
please feel free to ask it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I will answer it to the best of my
ability.
[SPEAKER_27]: If I cannot answer it, I will be honest
and tell you I don't know.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, dear.
[SPEAKER_34]: I would like to ask some questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_34]: Would you comment about the Philadelphia
experiment, Einstein and Marilyn Monroe?
[SPEAKER_35]: A little joke there for liberty.
[SPEAKER_27]: To be perfectly honest with you,
the only thing I know about the
[SPEAKER_27]: Philadelphia experiment is what I saw in
the movie.
[SPEAKER_27]: I cannot give you a qualified opinion.
[SPEAKER_27]: About the book.
[SPEAKER_27]: And what was the rest of your question?
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, I was wondering in connection with
that about the mystery connected with
[SPEAKER_34]: Einstein's involvement with the
Philadelphia experiment and the rumors
[SPEAKER_34]: about Marilyn Monroe being not only
beautiful, but intelligent and her
[SPEAKER_34]: connection with the Kennedys and why
Jackie Kennedy kept quiet about
[SPEAKER_34]: everything.
[SPEAKER_34]: Could she also perhaps in fear for her
life?
[SPEAKER_27]: My dear lady, you are asking me questions
that I have absolutely no knowledge at all
[SPEAKER_27]: on.
[SPEAKER_27]: I see.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't answer them for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you talk about the circumstances where
you reviewed this report 13 in England?
[SPEAKER_07]: You were in the service there or a little
more detail?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a civilian employee.
[SPEAKER_27]: I was employed by the Department of
Defense Security Services Command.
[SPEAKER_27]: The document came across my desk in a
diplomatic pouch with a disposition form
[SPEAKER_27]: instructing me to analyze the document,
assign it a probability rate as to whether
[SPEAKER_27]: or not it was true, whatever.
[SPEAKER_27]: All I did was my job, which is essentially
analyze the document that was presented in
[SPEAKER_27]: my inbox and write a summation of it.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Bill, will you discourse at length
about some of the contents of this
[SPEAKER_19]: document and just get into it for about
five minutes and tell us some of the
[SPEAKER_19]: things that you saw and, above all,
some of your feelings towards this
[SPEAKER_19]: material.
[SPEAKER_19]: What were you feeling?
[SPEAKER_19]: What was it like to read this?
[SPEAKER_19]: And tell us about this material because as
a ufologist, I'm more interested in the
[SPEAKER_19]: flying saucers than I am about the petty
squabbles between the researchers.
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_27]: At the time when I read the document,
it was reported in the document that the
[SPEAKER_27]: United States had in its possession
several UFOs.
[SPEAKER_27]: Technological reports showed that on a few
of them they had been dismantled.
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a photograph of what was labeled
as an atomic generator or a nuclear power
[SPEAKER_27]: unit, which was no bigger than a
basketball.
[SPEAKER_27]: The inside of the craft
[SPEAKER_27]: showed apparently what were control boards
with strange writing on them.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not a linguist, so I couldn't begin to
tell you what it said.
[SPEAKER_27]: There was a great deal of stuff,
a lot of things that just dealt most... I
[SPEAKER_27]: was more interested, to be honest with
you, in the autopsy pictures.
[SPEAKER_27]: Several of the autopsy pictures showed
alien cadavers on autopsy tables.
[SPEAKER_27]: That had been vivisectioned.
[SPEAKER_27]: Several photographs showed an alien head
which had been removed from the body,
[SPEAKER_27]: cut in half, which showed brain casings.
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of these photographs were in color.
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of them were in black and white.
[SPEAKER_27]: One particular photograph that I remember
distinctly was that of three aliens shoved
[SPEAKER_27]: up against what appeared to be a white
tile wall.
[SPEAKER_27]: In which they looked very confused and a
photograph of them was taken.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_27]: Live aliens.
[SPEAKER_37]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, sir, May.
[SPEAKER_37]: Isn't it true, Bill, that our government
believed for quite some time that these
[SPEAKER_37]: grays boasted that they created Jesus
Christ?
[SPEAKER_37]: I know it's kind of heavy.
[SPEAKER_37]: And I figured I'd drop it on you.
[SPEAKER_27]: It is rumored that this is, in fact,
what has taken place.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's rumored that because of biogenetic
engineering, Jesus Christ was engineered
[SPEAKER_27]: by the aliens.
[SPEAKER_27]: Quite honestly, I have no knowledge of
this.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not a theologian.
[SPEAKER_27]: And to be perfectly honest with you,
that is a topic that I am afraid to even
[SPEAKER_27]: approach for the simple fact that it is so
hot, I would get burned.
[SPEAKER_27]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_27]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_20]: As a civilian employee and privileged to
that kind of information, I wonder what it
[SPEAKER_20]: was that led to them flopping that on your
desk and what your direct reaction to
[SPEAKER_20]: information about UFOs.
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you have any previous orientation
toward UFOs?
[SPEAKER_27]: Perfectly frank with you, I had no
interest in UFOs whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_27]: I had no knowledge of them.
[SPEAKER_27]: We went into, we found the aircraft.
[SPEAKER_27]: We were supposed to bring out survivors if
there were any.
[SPEAKER_27]: There were none.
[SPEAKER_27]: At that time, I had no concept of UFOs,
ufology, mutilations whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_27]: We found the entire crew still in their
safety harnesses and their seat in the
[SPEAKER_27]: aircraft.
[SPEAKER_27]: The aircraft had not crashed.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was perfectly intact.
[SPEAKER_27]: The only visible damage that we could see
was the fact that the engine pods were
[SPEAKER_27]: damaged because the aircraft was sitting
on them.
[SPEAKER_27]: The crew had been mutilated.
[SPEAKER_27]: And every classical sense of the word,
as described by Linda Howe in her book of
[SPEAKER_27]: cattle mutilations,
[SPEAKER_27]: we photographed the bodies.
[SPEAKER_27]: We grabbed dog tags.
[SPEAKER_27]: We destroyed the aircraft with the bodies
in it.
[SPEAKER_27]: We returned to our assigned base.
[SPEAKER_27]: The photographs were forwarded to McVie
headquarters in Saigon.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was the last I ever saw of them until
1976 when they appeared in the Grudge Blue
[SPEAKER_27]: Book 13 report.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I recognized them as being the
photographs that I took.
[SPEAKER_27]: So I had no doubt whatsoever as to the
authenticity of the document.
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you think that they knew that handing
you the file for your analysis?
[SPEAKER_27]: It's entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_27]: I could have been set up.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then beyond that, after you did
analyze it and write your report,
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm unfamiliar with that.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm just wondering if that was what led
directly to your ousting in the service.
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_27]: Next question, please.
[SPEAKER_27]: We're running short on time.
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope you don't feel slighted.
[SPEAKER_27]: If I cut you off, but I'll try and get as
many in as I can.
[SPEAKER_27]: So please make it brief.
[SPEAKER_28]: I understand you had one day to analyze
the report.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the recollection I have from
reading about the report.
[SPEAKER_28]: And it was not until sometime later that
you tried to reproduce the report from
[SPEAKER_28]: memory.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, say again.
[SPEAKER_28]: It was sometime later when you tried to
kind of regenerate the report from memory
[SPEAKER_28]: from your one day or so.
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you characterize if you think that
your recollection of the report was
[SPEAKER_28]: complete or to what extent do you think
you were able to kind of regurgitate what
[SPEAKER_28]: you actually saw?
[SPEAKER_27]: Initially, it was about 95%.
[SPEAKER_27]: After 13 years, it's probably a little bit
less.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's actually a very high percentage.
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that just your talent?
[SPEAKER_27]: I have an idyllic memory.
[SPEAKER_27]: OK.
[SPEAKER_28]: Your what?
[SPEAKER_27]: Your what?
[SPEAKER_27]: I have an idyllic memory.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_27]: I got it, but I can't say it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_06]: We were shown a videotape narrated by Rod
Serling of the landing at Holloman Air
[SPEAKER_06]: Force Base.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the aliens' faces were described with
large noses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that contradicts most of the
descriptions we've heard about the,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, the popularly published descriptions
of the aliens.
[SPEAKER_06]: The photos that you saw of the cadavers,
did they suggest faces like those that we
[SPEAKER_06]: saw in that tape?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do you explain that description?
[SPEAKER_27]: I see some of the gentlemen walking around
here with these strange white tags hanging
[SPEAKER_27]: off their collars.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a picture of an alien.
[SPEAKER_27]: That pretty much characterized what they
look like in the pictures that I saw.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's entirely possible that those aliens
which landed at Holloman Air Force Base
[SPEAKER_27]: were of a different species.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_33]: I have a question about a book that I
discovered being measured in the Flying
[SPEAKER_33]: Saucer Review.
[SPEAKER_33]: In fact, being debunked and ridiculed
there, and actually found a bookstore in
[SPEAKER_33]: Los Angeles, the book called The Rancher.
[SPEAKER_33]: And when I opened it, the thing that
grabbed my attention was mentioning of
[SPEAKER_33]: universes, Schubert universes,
central universes, low-key universes,
[SPEAKER_33]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_33]: And having some background in physics,
in engineering, and being interested in
[SPEAKER_33]: different dimensions, I said, well,
gee, interesting.
[SPEAKER_33]: Got the book.
[SPEAKER_33]: And I've been reading it carefully all
these months.
[SPEAKER_33]: It was written in 34, 35, translated into
English in the subsequent years,
[SPEAKER_33]: probably distributed through some- Your
point, sir, please.
[SPEAKER_27]: We're running short on time.
[SPEAKER_33]: My question is, did you find any
mentioning of this book in the documents
[SPEAKER_33]: that you came in contact with?
[SPEAKER_33]: Because in the book, there are many
chapters that would describe alien
[SPEAKER_33]: anatomies of different dozens of cases.
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, first of all, I'm not familiar with
the book.
[SPEAKER_27]: What I saw in the document was technically
oriented.
[SPEAKER_27]: There was made mention of the possibility
of interdimensional travel.
[SPEAKER_27]: But at that point, and now, I have no
knowledge of physics whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_33]: So I could not answer your- It's not a
book about dimensions.
[SPEAKER_33]: It's more a book about life in the
universe and the different types of beings
[SPEAKER_33]: in the universe.
[SPEAKER_33]: And they would have chapters and chapters
of listing of different biological types
[SPEAKER_33]: of entities, a lot of knowledge in
chemistry, in physics, astronomy,
[SPEAKER_32]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_27]: Having not read the book, I can't give you
an honest and qualified answer.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_27]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir, Bill.
[SPEAKER_08]: We knew that the aliens are very good at
telepathy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if in the early days, the aliens were
mistreated by humans, don't you think that
[SPEAKER_08]: that was conveyed to the alien nation
early on and as a result, I mean,
[SPEAKER_08]: don't you think they're waiting to get
even or have gotten even?
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, not being telepathic, I can't answer
that question, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_27]: If they are telepathic, I would imagine
that if one knows, they all know.
[SPEAKER_27]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank
you very much for allowing me this time
[SPEAKER_27]: and thank you for listening to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's absolutely the worst introduction I
have ever had.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't trust the males these days.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ladies and gentlemen, friends and
adversaries, associates and colleagues,
[SPEAKER_15]: in short, fellow ufologists.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had really wanted to come here tonight
and kick ass, but fortunately for us,
[SPEAKER_15]: all wiser heads have prevailed and we're
going to keep this thing professional.
[SPEAKER_15]: Before I begin, it seems appropriate to
first take a few moments to personally
[SPEAKER_15]: thank Mr. Wolde of the MUFON organization
and the organizers and hosts of this
[SPEAKER_15]: symposium, whose kind invitation made it
possible for me to be here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also appreciative of this excellent
time spot, which must mean that those who
[SPEAKER_15]: arranged the schedule must think that I
have something to say.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll try not to disappoint you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I might also add that my talk here tonight
is primarily directed at those of you who
[SPEAKER_15]: are members of the UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not to suggest that those of you
who are here as third parties won't find
[SPEAKER_15]: it interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that you might not be able to
follow some of the in-house comments I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: going to make.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's supposed to outhouse comments,
which I'll try to avoid, even though some
[SPEAKER_15]: cases they may be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_15]: Having anticipated the faltering star,
allow me to introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm aware that you already know my name
and I'm equally certain that many of you
[SPEAKER_15]: are wondering just who is Bill Moore and
what's he up to?
[SPEAKER_15]: Added to that, I'm sure many other
questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this man a government agent?
[SPEAKER_15]: What about his rumored contacts within the
intelligence community?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are the MJ-12 documents real?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or are they counterfeit?
[SPEAKER_15]: And if they're counterfeit, did he forge
them?
[SPEAKER_15]: And isn't he really in it for the money
after all?
[SPEAKER_15]: The truth about Bill Moore, I'm afraid,
is considerably less sensational.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you out there that know me well
can vouch for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who don't can verify it easily
enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: Bill Moore graduated from college in 1965.
[SPEAKER_15]: Between that time and 1979, I spent 14
years as a high school teacher and a
[SPEAKER_15]: concurrent tenure as a part-time labor
relations expert within the structure of
[SPEAKER_15]: the Minnesota Education Association.
[SPEAKER_15]: In both cases, I had an excellent
reputation.
[SPEAKER_15]: In 1979, after having successfully
published the Philadelphia Experiment with
[SPEAKER_15]: co-author Charles Berlitz, I resigned my
teaching position and moved with my family
[SPEAKER_15]: to Arizona in order to take up writing
full-time.
[SPEAKER_15]: In 1980, I co-authored a second
bestseller, The Roswell Incident,
[SPEAKER_15]: which was the preliminary account of an
investigation into an alleged UFO crash in
[SPEAKER_15]: New Mexico in 1947.
[SPEAKER_15]: At that time, the book was skeptically
received by the UFO community and
[SPEAKER_15]: mercilessly panned by the debunkers.
[SPEAKER_15]: I stood my ground, broke with Berlitz,
weathered the storm of war, the rocks and
[SPEAKER_15]: mud that was thrown in my direction,
and ultimately, with continued
[SPEAKER_15]: high-quality research and a careful,
skeptical, journalistic approach,
[SPEAKER_15]: managed to persuade many of the initial
doubters that there was indeed something
[SPEAKER_15]: to the case.
[SPEAKER_15]: In so doing, I earned the respect of many
of you in the audience.
[SPEAKER_15]: I expect that my reputation and
credibility with respect to the Roswell
[SPEAKER_15]: case is at least partly responsible for my
having been invited to speak here tonight.
[SPEAKER_15]: I urge you to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're one of those who respects my
work on Roswell, then I ask you to
[SPEAKER_15]: consider that I'm trying to carry on the
same sort of quality investigation with
[SPEAKER_15]: respect to my current project.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that the circumstances are quite
different and I've not been in a position
[SPEAKER_15]: until now to properly inform others about
what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: This, unfortunately, has given rise to
considerable controversy with a number of
[SPEAKER_15]: falsehoods having been spread by others in
the UFO community who saw fit to jump to
[SPEAKER_15]: hasty conclusions inappropriately formed
without benefit of all the facts.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the most persistent rumors about me
is that I'm a rich man or that I'm somehow
[SPEAKER_15]: funded by the government to spread
disinformation and dissension with in the
[SPEAKER_15]: UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither could be further from the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: The real Bill Moore is as poor as a church
mouse.
[SPEAKER_15]: I came away from a divorce in 1983 with
virtually nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I went through bankruptcy shortly
thereafter.
[SPEAKER_15]: I began to rebuild my life.
[SPEAKER_15]: The money I make from writing,
royalties, and the sale of mostly
[SPEAKER_15]: UFO-oriented books and publications is all
plowed back into living expenses and
[SPEAKER_15]: continuing research.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a constant scrape to get by,
but I believe in what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in order to preserve the freedom
necessary to continue, I've had to make
[SPEAKER_15]: sacrifices.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm definitely not in this business for
the money.
[SPEAKER_15]: I live in a rented house.
[SPEAKER_15]: I drive a 1977 car and a 1979 motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no savings accounts, no stocks,
no bonds, and I recently dropped my health
[SPEAKER_15]: insurance because I couldn't afford it any
longer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not looking for a handout,
nor do I expect any sympathy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I simply tell you this because I want it
on the record.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who are spreading rumors that I live
in wealth and comfort are invited to come
[SPEAKER_15]: and verify the situation any time they
wish.
[SPEAKER_15]: My door is open.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who allege that I have counterfeited
documents and concocted a hoax on the
[SPEAKER_15]: MJ-12 matter had better take the same
facts into account.
[SPEAKER_15]: Rest assured, I know myself well enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I was trying to perpetrate a hoax,
I would have played it for all the cash I
[SPEAKER_15]: could get a long time ago and taken the
money and run.
[SPEAKER_15]: As some are doing even now in the UFO
community.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as for my being on the government's
payroll, I can only say that I wish I was.
[SPEAKER_15]: The government pays well and it provides
excellent benefits.
[SPEAKER_15]: So why should you believe anything Bill
Moore has to say?
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact is that I have information that
will add to your knowledge of the UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: phenomena.
[SPEAKER_15]: I will report it to you in as reliable a
fashion as I can and in as objective a
[SPEAKER_15]: manner as possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you who have numbered among my
friends and supporters will perhaps find
[SPEAKER_15]: it comforting.
[SPEAKER_15]: In light of some of the more outrageous
rumors that have been circulating
[SPEAKER_15]: throughout the UFO community recently.
[SPEAKER_15]: Others of you who have chosen to cast
aspersions and throw rocks in my
[SPEAKER_15]: directions out of fear that I might
uncover something which will upstage your
[SPEAKER_15]: own efforts will undoubtedly take great
pains to dissect what I have to say here
[SPEAKER_15]: in an effort to find more reasons to
question my integrity.
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the final analysis, I'm not asking you
to believe, only to listen.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you do from that point is entirely up
to you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Two years ago at the MUFON Symposium in
Washington DC, I stood before a similar
[SPEAKER_15]: audience and presented preliminary
information on the so-called MJ-12 papers.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also alluded at that time to a series of
ongoing contacts between myself and a
[SPEAKER_15]: number of well-placed individuals within
the government and the intelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: community.
[SPEAKER_15]: American youthology has been in a turmoil
over the MJ-12 matter ever since.
[SPEAKER_15]: With charges and counter charges being
thrown back and forth so fast that it's
[SPEAKER_15]: almost impossible to keep up with them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Worse, the rumor mill fueled by
speculation, disinformation, and
[SPEAKER_15]: increasingly gross exaggerations on the
part of those who ought to know better has
[SPEAKER_15]: emerged as a major force which it
sometimes seems from this vantage point
[SPEAKER_15]: has all but replaced common sense and
solid judgment in some circles.
[SPEAKER_15]: What ought to have been a sane and
concerted effort to get at the truth has
[SPEAKER_15]: taken on virtually all the trappings of a
three ring circus.
[SPEAKER_15]: And American youthology as I see it now
stands at the edge of a severe crisis
[SPEAKER_15]: which has already shaken it to its very
core.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have every confidence that youthology
will survive.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it will emerge from this present
state of flux with as much credibility as
[SPEAKER_15]: it had going in, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: I for one am somewhat ashamed and
embarrassed by the mudslinging that I have
[SPEAKER_15]: witnessed, much of it directed at me these
past two years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the incessant and increasing rumor
mongering which has tantalized us all by
[SPEAKER_15]: its highly sensational nature and yet in
the final analysis has offered us so very
[SPEAKER_15]: little in the way of tangible evidence.
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope what I have to say here tonight
will have the positive effect of laying
[SPEAKER_15]: some of it to rest.
[SPEAKER_15]: But speaking in all candor, I certainly
won't count on it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Throughout our history mankind has
witnessed many quests and in every case
[SPEAKER_15]: those who study history tell us that there
was the inevitable clack of narrow minded
[SPEAKER_15]: fools who believing that such quests waste
time and energy better spent on useful
[SPEAKER_15]: endeavors did everything they could to
discourage the process and discredit the
[SPEAKER_15]: individuals involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pardon my observation but so it is with
our present quest for knowledge about
[SPEAKER_15]: UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether UFOs are or are not
extraterrestrial is really only a part of
[SPEAKER_15]: the picture.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the final analysis, the process of
studying this phenomenon and the people
[SPEAKER_15]: involved with it, of assessing the claims
and the counterclaims and of dealing with
[SPEAKER_15]: the question of how we as earthlings will
react to the discovery of a race of
[SPEAKER_15]: extraterrestrial visitors and how they
will react to us, all of this and more
[SPEAKER_15]: when finally looked at in perspective,
leads us to the inescapable recognition
[SPEAKER_15]: that in studying the UFO phenomenon we are
at the same time becoming more aware of
[SPEAKER_15]: ourselves as individuals and learning
something about the society that we are a
[SPEAKER_15]: part of.
[SPEAKER_15]: The recognition as noted by my friend Stan
Friedman many years ago that any alien
[SPEAKER_15]: spending ten minutes looking at planet
earth must come away with the conclusion
[SPEAKER_15]: that we are in the eyes of that alien,
nothing more than a primitive society
[SPEAKER_15]: whose major activity is tribal warfare.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it once both revealing and powerful?
[SPEAKER_15]: It is through the mirror of UFOs as alien
visitors that we ultimately come to look
[SPEAKER_15]: at ourselves and to recognize what and who
we really are.
[SPEAKER_15]: Such a process can only prove beneficial
to mankind in the long term regardless of
[SPEAKER_15]: what the true nature of UFOs turns out to
be and those who would stand in its way by
[SPEAKER_15]: attempting to heap derision or ridicule
upon the subject do us a grave disservice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Had mankind's greatest inventors,
scientists, explorers, builders,
[SPEAKER_15]: painters, musicians, composers,
physicians, surgeons, the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_15]: The point is had these people throughout
our history heated the mindless
[SPEAKER_15]: blusterings and ravings of the skeptics,
the scoffers, and the debunkers who were
[SPEAKER_15]: present in each and every case,
there would have been no progress and
[SPEAKER_15]: mankind would still be in the stone age.
[SPEAKER_15]: Moreover, in every case where a
breakthrough was achieved and progress was
[SPEAKER_15]: made, it is the achiever who is remembered
and honored by history and not the
[SPEAKER_15]: debunker and the skeptic who said it could
not be done.
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line here is that the UFO
phenomenon is a legitimate study by anyone
[SPEAKER_15]: in our free society who chooses to do so.
[SPEAKER_15]: And those who have elected to participate
in such a quest should not be held up to
[SPEAKER_15]: derision and ridicule because of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those debunkers and UFO bashers who have
nothing positive to contribute are advised
[SPEAKER_15]: to go and massage their egos somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_15]: In my opinion, those people have no right
whatsoever to dictate to others what is
[SPEAKER_15]: fit for study and what is not,
or what people should believe and what
[SPEAKER_15]: they shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_15]: Which brings me to my next point.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been accumulating information on the
UFO phenomenon for more than 25 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: During that time, I have worked and
watched UFOlogy trying to grow up,
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to achieve respectability with the
public, the news media, and the scientific
[SPEAKER_15]: community.
[SPEAKER_15]: In that process, I am sorry to say it's
been my observation that we have been our
[SPEAKER_15]: own worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_15]: No skeptic, no debunker could possibly do
what we have done to ourselves not once,
[SPEAKER_15]: but time and time again.
[SPEAKER_15]: We say we want respectability,
yet we have made little effort to
[SPEAKER_15]: construct the foundations necessary to
achieve it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sadly, we have no uniform standards,
no professional ethics, no peers,
[SPEAKER_15]: no qualifications, no uniform goals,
and few credible spokespersons.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody speaks for UFOlogy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or rather, perhaps more correctly,
everybody speaks for UFOlogy.
[SPEAKER_15]: All at the same time, and each with a
different voice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody can be a UFOlogist.
[SPEAKER_15]: All they need to do is tack the title of
the end of their name and publish,
[SPEAKER_15]: yes, even self-publish, a book,
start a newsletter, or get themselves on
[SPEAKER_15]: television.
[SPEAKER_15]: And should their material be pure,
unsubstantiated, clop trap, or broken
[SPEAKER_15]: crockery, that's cracked pottery for those
of you that don't get that one,
[SPEAKER_15]: no matter, there's always some other
self-styled UFOlogist who will come along,
[SPEAKER_15]: see it as the ultimate wisdom of the
universe, and endorse it wholeheartedly,
[SPEAKER_15]: thus adding further to the confusion.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it any wonder we have degenerated into
a host of political camps, each one of
[SPEAKER_15]: which throws rocks at as many of the
others as possible, while at the same time
[SPEAKER_15]: loudly proclaiming to all who will listen
that they are the only true religion?
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwhile, the debunkers who are
essentially united under a single banner
[SPEAKER_15]: throw rocks at all of us, and the public,
as hapless observers of the entire
[SPEAKER_15]: process, emerges more confused than ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: With that in mind, I would like to take a
moment and ask each and every member of
[SPEAKER_15]: this audience to reach down inside
yourself and come up with a true answer to
[SPEAKER_15]: a very important and difficult question.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you say publicly has no meaning in
this process.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's what you know, inside of yourself,
to be truth that matters.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want you to ask yourself, why are you
involved with the UFO phenomenon?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you truly desire answers, no matter
what those answers may be, and no matter
[SPEAKER_15]: how much those answers may be at variance
with what you put forward?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you presently believe, or are you one
of those people who thrives on a
[SPEAKER_15]: continuing mystery, whose very position in
the field of ufology requires that the
[SPEAKER_15]: mystery of UFOs be perpetuated rather than
solved, so that you can continue in your
[SPEAKER_15]: self-styled role of importance?
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's suppose you are the head of an
organization devoted to the study of UFOs,
[SPEAKER_15]: and there are several such here,
including myself, what happens to your
[SPEAKER_15]: organization, and ultimately to you
yourself, if the UFO mystery is suddenly
[SPEAKER_15]: solved?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you truly want to see that happen,
or is it more palatable and convenient to
[SPEAKER_15]: keep the pot simmering for as long as
possible?
[SPEAKER_15]: Only you and you alone know what it is
that motivates you.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're one who's sincerely interested
in finding answers, and if you can
[SPEAKER_15]: perceive with an open mind, then maybe I
can offer you some inspiration.
[SPEAKER_15]: If, on the other hand, you are one who
prefers to inflate your own image through
[SPEAKER_15]: the spreading of unsubstantiated,
often alarming, and increasingly
[SPEAKER_15]: sensationalistic disinformation,
hearsay, and rumor, then I urge you to
[SPEAKER_15]: reassess your position and channel your
energies along more acceptable lines.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you haven't thought about that,
I urge you to do so.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's important that we all know where we
stand.
[SPEAKER_15]: As for myself, I made my decision a number
of years ago as a result of suddenly
[SPEAKER_15]: having found myself face-to-face with an
opportunity to learn more about what our
[SPEAKER_15]: government knows about UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe then, and I continue to believe
now, that it is possible to uncover
[SPEAKER_15]: answers by searching carefully and
comprehensively.
[SPEAKER_15]: Finding those answers and thus ending my
so-called career as a ufologist poses no
[SPEAKER_15]: problems at all for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a writer, I'm interested in a variety
of subjects, many of them non-UFO related.
[SPEAKER_15]: Should I go as far as I feel I can with a
UFO question, I have plenty of other fish
[SPEAKER_15]: to fry, many of which are just as
interesting and every bit as challenging.
[SPEAKER_15]: The truth, fellow ufologists, is that I
have known precisely what I was doing all
[SPEAKER_15]: along.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that very few other people knew
what I was doing, and it was this lack of
[SPEAKER_15]: information on the part of other
researchers that has given rise to so much
[SPEAKER_15]: controversy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Consequently, I harbor no grudge against
others who have attacked me sometimes
[SPEAKER_15]: bitterly because they disagreed with my
methods.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or because they mistook my refusal to
answer their often legitimate questions as
[SPEAKER_15]: a display of arrogance and contempt.
[SPEAKER_15]: I counseled patients then, and I counsel
it now.
[SPEAKER_15]: A rush to judgment is a dangerous and a
divisive thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who engage in such practices may
sound high-minded and well-informed at
[SPEAKER_15]: first blush, but in the long run,
they do nothing to enhance their own
[SPEAKER_15]: stature or credibility.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they certainly contribute nothing to
our quest for answers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Consider the strange case of Mr. Smith,
Mr. Jones, and the jury.
[SPEAKER_15]: You, the audience, are the jury.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Smith is dead.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Jones is being tried for the murder.
[SPEAKER_15]: The prosecutor stands before you and gives
you these facts.
[SPEAKER_15]: When the police arrived in response to a
complaint that a fight was in progress,
[SPEAKER_15]: he says, Mr. Smith was found lying dead on
the floor of his apartment.
[SPEAKER_15]: The cause of death was strangulation,
and the body was still warm.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Jones was found bending over the body
with his hands still around the victim's
[SPEAKER_15]: throat.
[SPEAKER_15]: Neighbors and others who knew both men
have testified that there was considerable
[SPEAKER_15]: animosity between the two of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that on more than one occasion,
Mr. Jones was heard to threaten Mr.
[SPEAKER_15]: Smith's safety and well-being.
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, Jones had gone to see Smith,
and a violent argument ensued during which
[SPEAKER_15]: Jones strangled Smith.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately for Jones, the police
arrived before he was able to effect an
[SPEAKER_15]: escape from the scene.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the jury.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this sufficient evidence to condemn Mr.
Jones for murder?
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried out this scenario during
conversations with a number of people over
[SPEAKER_15]: the past few months, and I was amazed at
how many people agreed that it is,
[SPEAKER_15]: one of whom was my good friend,
Walt Andrus, who recently saw fit to
[SPEAKER_15]: publish an outrageously lopsided piece of
trash in his newsletter written by a man
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never met, spoken to, or corresponded
with, and who could have easily obtained
[SPEAKER_15]: answers to his questions simply by taking
the trouble to ask.
[SPEAKER_15]: A significant minority who listened to my
Smith and Jones scenario, however,
[SPEAKER_15]: hesitated before passing judgment.
[SPEAKER_15]: What is Mr. Jones's defense?
[SPEAKER_15]: They wanted to know.
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, that's really what it's all
about.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the case of Smith and Jones,
the truth is that it was Smith who invited
[SPEAKER_15]: Jones to his apartment with the intention
of quietly doing him in and disposing of
[SPEAKER_15]: the body.
[SPEAKER_15]: before anyone was the wiser.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jones, however, turned the tables on Smith
and accidentally killed him in the process
[SPEAKER_15]: of self-defense.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it is in the case of Moore,
the government, and MJ-12.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who have already decided that I'm
one of the bad guys in this controversial
[SPEAKER_15]: case have done so on the basis of only
half a story.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have rushed to judgment without
hearing the defense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, some of the most vocal of my
critics have never once bothered to
[SPEAKER_15]: contact me and ask me if I had a defense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tasty pudding, as one recent track put it
quite humorously, a track which,
[SPEAKER_15]: by the way, I did not write, but which I
found to be most appropriate.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I can't provide you with
the entire case for the defense this
[SPEAKER_15]: evening.
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason is the defense is still in
process of completing its investigation.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can provide you with a significant
part of it enough so that at least you can
[SPEAKER_15]: begin to understand what I've been doing
and where it's all going.
[SPEAKER_15]: For some of you, it may not be what you
want to hear, but it's nonetheless true.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it should provide you with a good
sense of perspective concerning a lot of
[SPEAKER_15]: other things that have been going on in
ufological circles recently.
[SPEAKER_15]: It all began more than 10 years ago with a
man named Paul Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me preface my remarks by offering the
sincere and candid statement that what I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: going to say is to the best of my
knowledge entirely true.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is offered without malice or prejudice
in any way and is under no circumstances
[SPEAKER_15]: intended to be libelous or defamatory.
[SPEAKER_15]: I genuinely like Mr. Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: Continue to regard him as a friend and
have a great deal of sympathy for the
[SPEAKER_15]: difficulties he's been through.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is not my intention to upset him with
these revelations, but rather to add a few
[SPEAKER_15]: facts to a record that's been out of
balance for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona
during the late summer of 1979 and as a
[SPEAKER_15]: result had become somewhat closer to Jim
and Coral Lorenzen of the Old Aerial
[SPEAKER_15]: Phenomena Research Organization or APRO in
Tucson.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, they invited me to become a
member of the APRO Board of Directors and
[SPEAKER_15]: I accepted.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was in this capacity that I first
became acquainted with the work being done
[SPEAKER_15]: by Paul Benowitz and Dr. Leo Sprinkle
regarding an alleged UFO abduction
[SPEAKER_15]: involving a young woman and several
others, which had occurred sometime
[SPEAKER_15]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: The woman had been hypnotically regressed
by Dr. Sprinkle and had provided a strange
[SPEAKER_15]: account of having witnessed a cattle
mutilation in process and subsequently
[SPEAKER_15]: having been taken by her alien abductors
into some sort of craft or facility where
[SPEAKER_15]: these aliens were actively engaged in
processing fluids and severed body parts
[SPEAKER_15]: obtained from these cattle.
[SPEAKER_15]: During the course of the hypnosis sessions
which began as near as I can recall in
[SPEAKER_15]: August of 1979, Benowitz had become
convinced that the aliens had implanted
[SPEAKER_15]: some sort of communication device in the
woman's head and that they were using this
[SPEAKER_15]: device to control her actions.
[SPEAKER_15]: His theory was that they could actually
see what she saw and hear what she heard
[SPEAKER_15]: by means of this device.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, Benowitz being a physicist by
profession and having a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_15]: electronics equipment at his disposal and
the wherewithal to purchase more as
[SPEAKER_15]: needed, set out to determine whether it
might be possible to detect the
[SPEAKER_15]: electromagnetic signals he believed these
aliens must be using to exercise their
[SPEAKER_15]: control over their alleged victims and to
try to devise a way to shield the victim
[SPEAKER_15]: from the control of the signals.
[SPEAKER_15]: He dubbed his effort Project Beta and
communicated to APRO in late 1979 that he
[SPEAKER_15]: believed he had succeeded in detecting
signals from UFOs and had begun to make
[SPEAKER_15]: calculations about the sort of electronic
and propulsion technology employed by
[SPEAKER_15]: these aliens.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was also at about this time that Paul
began to take both moving and still
[SPEAKER_15]: pictures of strange lights maneuvering in
the vicinity of the Manzano Nuclear
[SPEAKER_15]: Weapons Storage Facility which is located
on the east of Kirtland Air Force Base in
[SPEAKER_15]: Albuquerque and of which Benowitz had a
perfect view from his residence.
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz was convinced that these lights
were UFOs and that for some reason they
[SPEAKER_15]: were actively interested in both the
Manzano complex and the Coyote Canyon test
[SPEAKER_15]: area located directly south of Manzano on
the other side of the hills.
[SPEAKER_15]: During this time, the only awareness I had
of Benowitz and his work was what I was
[SPEAKER_15]: obtaining through APRO.
[SPEAKER_15]: I still had not met the man and in fact
was only mildly interested in the case.
[SPEAKER_15]: This based largely upon both Jim and Carl
Lorenzen's assessment of Benowitz as a
[SPEAKER_15]: dedicated researcher.
[SPEAKER_15]: But unfortunately one who was,
as Jim put it, prone to make great leaps
[SPEAKER_15]: of logic on the basis of incomplete data.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both Jim and Carl felt that Benowitz had
already decided what he was going to find
[SPEAKER_15]: before he went looking for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Still, although I didn't come to know
about it until a few months later,
[SPEAKER_15]: there apparently was something going on
involving UFOs near Manzano particularly
[SPEAKER_15]: during August, September, and October of
1980.
[SPEAKER_15]: And several agencies of the US government
including the Air Force Office of Special
[SPEAKER_15]: Investigations seemed more than just
casually interested in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: In early September 1980, I was approached
by a well-placed individual within the
[SPEAKER_15]: intelligence community who claimed to be
directly connected to a high-level
[SPEAKER_15]: government project dealing with UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: This individual, who subsequently came to
be known as the Falcon, told me that he
[SPEAKER_15]: spoke for a small group of similar
individuals who were uncomfortable with
[SPEAKER_15]: the government's continuing cover-up of
the truth and indicated that he and his
[SPEAKER_15]: group would like to help me with my
research into the subject in the hope that
[SPEAKER_15]: I might be able to help them find a way to
change their prevailing policy and get the
[SPEAKER_15]: facts out without breaking any laws in the
process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew I was being recruited, but at that
point I had no idea for what.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, I was told that if I was
interested in cooperating with their
[SPEAKER_15]: group, I would further be contacted by a
liaison man and that future meetings
[SPEAKER_15]: between me and the Falcon would be
arranged by this person.
[SPEAKER_15]: The liaison person who subsequently made
contact with me was AFOSI agent Richard
[SPEAKER_15]: Doty, a man who has since become quite
controversial in his own right and who
[SPEAKER_15]: many people have mistakenly assumed is the
Falcon himself.
[SPEAKER_15]: The story of my contacts with the Falcon,
Doty, and subsequently a number of others
[SPEAKER_15]: is something I will have considerably more
to say about at a later date.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm fully aware that such a course of
action will undoubtedly prompt the gossip
[SPEAKER_15]: mongers to begin circulating an entirely
new array of outrageous and
[SPEAKER_15]: unsubstantiated rumors, but so be it.
[SPEAKER_15]: My purpose here is to deal only with that
part of the story which is directly
[SPEAKER_15]: connected to the Benowitz affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: To those of you who want to know more
after hearing what I have to say tonight,
[SPEAKER_15]: I counsel continued patience.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have my assurance that the rest of the
story will ultimately be told as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: But before going back to the Benowitz
affair, let me make several points which
[SPEAKER_15]: seem appropriate at this juncture.
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, on the question of Richard
Doty and the Falcon, it's important to
[SPEAKER_15]: note that the name Falcon was invented by
my partner, Jamie Shannon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard Doty, who continued to be liaison
man, was similarly referred to by us as
[SPEAKER_15]: the Sparrow.
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither Sparrow nor Falcon were aware that
we were using these terms in reference to
[SPEAKER_15]: them, nor was anyone else.
[SPEAKER_15]: To the best of my knowledge, prior to
about mid-1985, it was in mid-1987,
[SPEAKER_15]: just after we went public with the MJ-12
papers, that at Falcon's suggestion and
[SPEAKER_15]: with the concurrence of Richard Doty,
we began dropping subtle hints that Falcon
[SPEAKER_15]: might in fact be Doty.
[SPEAKER_15]: Falcon felt that such a ploy would be
useful to him in continuing to protect his
[SPEAKER_15]: identity.
[SPEAKER_15]: While Doty, for his part, said that if
anybody asked, he could simply deny it,
[SPEAKER_15]: and that would be that.
[SPEAKER_15]: We agreed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as many of you are painfully aware,
it turned out to be an excellent
[SPEAKER_15]: diversion, particularly with respect to
the effect it had following the UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: cover-up live show, which was broadcast
nationally in October 1988.
[SPEAKER_15]: In all fairness to Mr. Doty here,
I should also like to comment that in my
[SPEAKER_15]: assessment, Rick is much better at
following orders and implementing the
[SPEAKER_15]: schemes of others than he is at coming up
with ideas of his own.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you that have devoted time and
energy to constantly badgering this man
[SPEAKER_15]: for more information should be aware that
all you are doing is making nuisances of
[SPEAKER_15]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_15]: Rick is not the man you're after.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the person in the control position
that's important here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as far as I'm aware, no one outside of
my project has any idea who that person
[SPEAKER_15]: might be or what his motives are.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, it was Falcon who sought me
out in September of 1980.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was Richard Doty, then with AFOSI
at Kirtland Air Force Base, who soon came
[SPEAKER_15]: into play as the middleman in that
process.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shortly thereafter, it became apparent to
me that my supplying information to the
[SPEAKER_15]: government, through Doty, on the
activities of Paul Benowitz, Apro,
[SPEAKER_15]: and to a lesser extent, several other
individuals, was to be a part of this
[SPEAKER_15]: equation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I also discovered that whatever it was
that Benowitz was involved with,
[SPEAKER_15]: he was the subject of considerable
interest on the part of not one,
[SPEAKER_15]: but several government agencies,
and that they were actively trying to
[SPEAKER_15]: defuse him by pumping as much
misinformation through him as he could
[SPEAKER_15]: possibly absorb.
[SPEAKER_15]: Being a very small part of that process
gave me, I thought, something of an
[SPEAKER_15]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_15]: It became my intention to play that
advantage for all the information I could
[SPEAKER_15]: get out of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz, for his part, continued to make
what, in my opinion, seemed to be
[SPEAKER_15]: increasingly irrational claims,
most of which gave every appearance of
[SPEAKER_15]: having been influenced by a heavy blanket
of disinformation mixed with a small but
[SPEAKER_15]: significant amount of truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: The problem was always one of keeping a
level head and trying to carefully sort
[SPEAKER_15]: the shit from the candy, something which
Paul didn't seem to be very good at.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then, Paul was, by that time,
very emotionally involved with the affair
[SPEAKER_15]: and rather skeptical of advice from any
quarter, unless it supported what he had
[SPEAKER_15]: already decided was the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: From my vantage point, being detached from
the mainstream but still close enough to
[SPEAKER_15]: appreciate what was happening,
it was somewhat easier to assess the
[SPEAKER_15]: process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I first met Paul in early 1981 and
continued contacts with him on a fairly
[SPEAKER_15]: regular basis through mid-1985.
[SPEAKER_15]: Contact since then has been sporadic.
[SPEAKER_15]: My role in the affair was largely that of
a freelancer providing information on
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul's then current thinking and
activities.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had nothing whatsoever to do with the
counterintelligence and the
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I either knew or was aware of a
number of people directly involved with
[SPEAKER_15]: that end of things.
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard Doty was one of these people.
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I came to know Doty well enough
to gain the impression that he was
[SPEAKER_15]: faithfully carrying out orders,
which he personally found distasteful.
[SPEAKER_15]: Perhaps it was for this reason that the
Falcon had chosen him as liaison person,
[SPEAKER_15]: although I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Frankly, I don't believe that Doty does
either.
[SPEAKER_15]: In my opinion, he was simply a pawn in a
much larger game, just as I was.
[SPEAKER_15]: As for Benowitz, by 1981 he was gathering
data from a variety of sources and
[SPEAKER_15]: amalgamating it with information being fed
to him by a number of government people,
[SPEAKER_15]: in whom for some reason he seemed to have
an implicit and abiding faith.
[SPEAKER_15]: The story that emerged from this melange
of fact, fiction, fantasy, hearsay,
[SPEAKER_15]: hard data and government disinformation
was absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yet somehow Paul believed in it and set
out on a one man crusade to tell the world
[SPEAKER_15]: that malevolent aliens from space were in
league with our government to take over
[SPEAKER_15]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_15]: What had begun in 1979 as an effort to
learn whether the behavior of a woman who
[SPEAKER_15]: claimed she had been abducted by UFO
aliens and was being influenced by some
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of radio remote control had in the
space of less than three years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Blossomed into a tale which rivaled the
wildest science fiction scenario anyone
[SPEAKER_15]: could possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, it seemed to me that Paul was
his own worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead of withholding judgment until all
of the facts were in, Paul insisted on
[SPEAKER_15]: repeatedly going off half cocked to
virtually anyone who would listen.
[SPEAKER_15]: Members of the press, other UFO
researchers, US congressmen and senators,
[SPEAKER_15]: people in military command positions,
members of the scientific establishment,
[SPEAKER_15]: even the president himself, all were
members or subjects of Paul's efforts to
[SPEAKER_15]: reach out and tell the world what he
sincerely believed to be happening.
[SPEAKER_15]: He wrote letters and made phone calls by
the hundreds.
[SPEAKER_15]: And to those who had neither the time nor
the inclination to look behind the words
[SPEAKER_15]: for a better understanding of the facts,
Paul with his professional credentials and
[SPEAKER_15]: technical vocabulary came off as a rather
credible individual, which must have
[SPEAKER_15]: caused quite a rash of headaches among the
people in high places who were desperately
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to defuse him.
[SPEAKER_15]: The idea that UFOs had something to do
with the phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, an increasing number of UFO
cases wherein the individual or
[SPEAKER_15]: individuals involved claim to have been
abducted by UFO aliens and taken aboard
[SPEAKER_15]: their craft against their will.
[SPEAKER_15]: Public exposure to this phenomenon got a
big boost in 1981.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul was particularly interested in these
cases.
[SPEAKER_15]: His hypothesis that people were being
abducted, implanted with some kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: alien control device and then being let go
again was completely consistent with the
[SPEAKER_15]: thinking of a number of other UFO
researchers at the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul's hypothesis, however, had a somewhat
more sinister spin than most.
[SPEAKER_15]: Third, his own experiments and research
regarding the radio signals he was
[SPEAKER_15]: receiving and the photographs and film
footage he was getting of unusual lights.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both of these phenomena seemed largely
though not entirely connected with goings
[SPEAKER_15]: on within the Kirtland Air Force Base
Sandia National Lab complex just south of
[SPEAKER_15]: Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no question that Paul was
receiving some sort of electromagnetic
[SPEAKER_15]: signal on his equipment.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is equally certain that his photos
and films do depict unusual lights,
[SPEAKER_15]: most of which were filmed while hovering
or maneuvering over the Kirtland Sandia
[SPEAKER_15]: complex.
[SPEAKER_15]: The real question here, however,
is whether Paul's evidence is sufficient
[SPEAKER_15]: to conclude that either of these phenomena
was directly related to UFO activity or
[SPEAKER_15]: whether in fact a prosaic explanation
exists which is more directly related to
[SPEAKER_15]: some classified government project.
[SPEAKER_15]: Admittedly, strong arguments can be made
in both directions, either one of which
[SPEAKER_15]: can be offered as an adequate explanation
of the government's counterintelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: activities in this case, which was the
fourth factor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Government surveillance of Paul and his
activities, some of which Paul was astute
[SPEAKER_15]: enough to detect and some of which I had
learned about but Paul seemed unaware of.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul took the surveillance activities,
which included wiretaps and, according to
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul, even break-ins, as proof positive
that he was on to something big.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, he seemed largely unaware
that the same people who would go to such
[SPEAKER_15]: lengths to spy on him also had the
capabilities to mount an effective
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation campaign.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, by mid-1982, Paul's story
contained virtually all of the elements
[SPEAKER_15]: found in the current crop of rumors being
circulated around the UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: There were two groups of aliens,
one malevolent, one more friendly.
[SPEAKER_15]: The malevolent ones, which Paul referred
to as the grays, were really in control
[SPEAKER_15]: and they were the ones responsible for the
cattle mutilations, for human abductions
[SPEAKER_15]: and the implanting of sinister control
devices in humans, for having first made
[SPEAKER_15]: and then broken a secret treaty with the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government, for maintaining a secret
underground base under Archuleta Peak near
[SPEAKER_15]: Dulce in northwestern New Mexico,
and for having supplied the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government with alien space hardware and
weapons which ultimately proved effective
[SPEAKER_15]: or which were caused to crash,
thus leaving human civilization virtually
[SPEAKER_15]: defenseless against invasion.
[SPEAKER_15]: According to Paul, an atomic-powered
spaceship which they had given to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: had been caused to crash on Archuleta Peak
near the entrance to an underground alien
[SPEAKER_15]: base and had sprayed the entire area with
radioactivity and wreckage.
[SPEAKER_15]: To prove it, he provided drawings which he
said he had made from photographs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I and others who examined Paul's
photographs as well as independently
[SPEAKER_15]: obtained pictures of the same area were
unable to see what Paul claimed was there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where he saw a crashed ship, burned
wreckage, entrances to the alien base,
[SPEAKER_15]: and weapons pointing skyward, others could
only see rocks, trees, and shadows.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no doubt that Paul believed that he
saw what he claimed, and for this I offer
[SPEAKER_15]: no explanation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I only know that what he claimed to see
wasn't what others saw.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no question that some of
Benowitz's pictures are interesting,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I must say that even though I viewed a
large number of them, I never saw one that
[SPEAKER_15]: I could get particularly excited about,
and I certainly never saw anything that I
[SPEAKER_15]: felt could be pointed to as proof positive
or even compelling evidence that he was
[SPEAKER_15]: photographing alien spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_15]: Much of his film was super eight
millimeter, which is too small a format
[SPEAKER_15]: for good quality and large money.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is also no question that Paul was
intercepting some kind of low frequency
[SPEAKER_15]: electromagnetic emission.
[SPEAKER_15]: The question was and remains, where was it
coming from?
[SPEAKER_15]: What was its purpose?
[SPEAKER_15]: And indeed, most importantly, was it UFO
related at all?
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul, at least, was totally convinced that
he was receiving alien radio
[SPEAKER_15]: transmissions, and had even gone so far as
to develop a home computer program capable
[SPEAKER_15]: of translating them into English.
[SPEAKER_15]: The problem, as I saw it, was that his
program, which he told me had been
[SPEAKER_15]: developed with the assistance of the
aliens themselves, assigned entire words,
[SPEAKER_15]: sentence fragments, and sometimes even
entire sentences themselves to the various
[SPEAKER_15]: individual pulses of energy within these
transmissions.
[SPEAKER_15]: The technique involved was such that it
could just as easily have been adapted to
[SPEAKER_15]: assign similar alien translations to the
various energy pulses found in ordinary
[SPEAKER_15]: Morse code.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a number of Paul's computer
printouts, which contain translations of
[SPEAKER_15]: those allegedly alien messages.
[SPEAKER_15]: If one breaks these apart into their
component words, sentence fragments,
[SPEAKER_15]: and sentences, and then shuffles the
components, the result is such that the
[SPEAKER_15]: new message says virtually the same thing
as the old one.
[SPEAKER_15]: The messages look fascinating until one
examines the method by which they were
[SPEAKER_15]: derived.
[SPEAKER_15]: After that, they are not nearly so
interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, lots of people saw the
messages.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very few had the opportunity to examine
the computer program which generated them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Along these same lines, at least some of
the things Paul was seeing and identifying
[SPEAKER_15]: as alien spacecraft were definitely not
UFOs at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: One evening while visiting him,
we went out in his sun deck just at
[SPEAKER_15]: twilight, and he pointed out a series of
lights slowly maneuvering far out over the
[SPEAKER_15]: West Mesa, perhaps 25 or 30 miles away.
[SPEAKER_15]: These, he said, were alien craft involved
in abducting people and implanting them.
[SPEAKER_15]: There certainly were lights maneuvering
out there, but even through good
[SPEAKER_15]: binoculars, they were not readily
identifiable.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul insisted they were UFOs and showed us
how to conduct a little test with our
[SPEAKER_15]: binoculars, which he said would prove it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Interested, but unconvinced, I drove
directly to West Mesa immediately after
[SPEAKER_15]: leaving Paul's home and parked my car at a
spot where I felt I would be able to get a
[SPEAKER_15]: good look at anything flying around that
area.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure enough, helicopters carrying large
searchlights began to maneuver slowly over
[SPEAKER_15]: my vantage point, only moments after I
arrived.
[SPEAKER_15]: One went directly over me at an altitude
of about 300 feet.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there is no doubt that it was a
helicopter.
[SPEAKER_15]: The next day I called Kirtland,
and they confirmed to me that there had
[SPEAKER_15]: indeed been a search and rescue training
mission in that area the night before.
[SPEAKER_15]: Such operations, they informed me,
were conducted over that area quite
[SPEAKER_15]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in 1982.
[SPEAKER_15]: Two years later, in 1984, Paul was still
making the same claims about these
[SPEAKER_15]: maneuvering lights to other UFO
researchers.
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as I'm aware, I was the only one
who took the trouble to check.
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul is a convincing and compelling
individual in person.
[SPEAKER_15]: He talks an excellent story, and it's easy
to see why so many people have been so
[SPEAKER_15]: intrigued by it over the years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, too many of the people who
have interviewed Paul have chosen to draw
[SPEAKER_15]: their conclusions about him based solely
or largely upon what he says and not upon
[SPEAKER_15]: the entire body of evidence presented by
the larger picture of the case itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: I too have spent considerable time with
Paul over a period of years and came to
[SPEAKER_15]: know him quite well in that process.
[SPEAKER_15]: As already stated, I viewed a large number
of Paul's films and photographs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I carefully examined satellite and aerial
survey photographs of both Archuleta Peak
[SPEAKER_15]: and Mesa, as well as aerial photos of the
area taken by Paul himself.
[SPEAKER_15]: I examined the computer program Paul was
using to decode the alleged alien radio
[SPEAKER_15]: transmissions and communications.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had a lengthy discussion about this
matter with the late Dr. Alan Heineck,
[SPEAKER_15]: who had also independently examined Paul's
program.
[SPEAKER_15]: I spent considerable time discussing the
affair with both Jim and Carl Lorenzen,
[SPEAKER_15]: both of whom were quite skeptical of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have copies of many of the reports
and letters Paul submitted to APRO
[SPEAKER_15]: beginning as far back as September of
1970.
[SPEAKER_15]: Moreover, as I have already stated,
I was personally aware of the intelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: community's concerted efforts to
systematically confuse, discourage,
[SPEAKER_15]: and discredit Paul by providing him with a
large body of information on the subject
[SPEAKER_15]: of UFOs, the malevolent aliens who
allegedly pilot them, the technology they
[SPEAKER_15]: employ, and the underground bases they
supposedly possess and occupy.
[SPEAKER_15]: The entire story of a secret treaty
between the US government and the aliens,
[SPEAKER_15]: of exchanges of technology between us and
the aliens, of battles between aliens and
[SPEAKER_15]: American armed forces, and of aliens
allegedly having implanted hundreds of
[SPEAKER_15]: thousands if not millions of human beings
for the purpose of taking over the world
[SPEAKER_15]: and using us as cattle or slaves came
about as a result of the disinformation
[SPEAKER_15]: process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know because I was in a position to
observe much of this process as it
[SPEAKER_15]: unfolded.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was providing regular reports on its
effectiveness to some of the very people
[SPEAKER_15]: who were doing it to Paul.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can tell you that it was effective
because I watched Paul become
[SPEAKER_15]: systematically more paranoid and more
emotionally unstable as he tried to
[SPEAKER_15]: assimilate what was happening to him.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had guns and knives all over his house.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had installed extra locks on his doors.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he swore that they, meaning the
aliens, were coming through his walls at
[SPEAKER_15]: night and injecting him with hideous
chemicals which would knock him out for
[SPEAKER_15]: long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_15]: He told me he had no idea what they were
doing with him after he was knocked out.
[SPEAKER_15]: He began to suffer increasing bouts of
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_15]: Others took over the day-to-day operation
of his business.
[SPEAKER_15]: As he went through this, one day I watched
him eat not a bite of his lunch while he
[SPEAKER_15]: chain-smoked 28 cigarettes in 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew at that time that he was not far
from an inevitable nervous collapse.
[SPEAKER_15]: His health had deteriorated.
[SPEAKER_15]: He had lost considerable weight.
[SPEAKER_15]: His hand shook as if from palsy.
[SPEAKER_15]: And he looked terrible.
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried to counsel him to drop the entire
UFO thing before his health was completely
[SPEAKER_15]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_15]: He said he knew things were getting bad
and he was trying to cope with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not long afterward, I heard he had been
hospitalized and was under psychiatric
[SPEAKER_15]: care.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether UFOs were actually ever involved
with all of this and to what extent,
[SPEAKER_15]: I never really knew.
[SPEAKER_15]: Perhaps Paul had nearly stumbled upon
signals generated from some sophisticated,
[SPEAKER_15]: high-level government project whose
security people had hit upon UFO-related
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation as their ultimate cover.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or perhaps he had discovered a real,
although somewhat less sensational,
[SPEAKER_15]: government UFO project, if that's
possible, which he elected to disinform
[SPEAKER_15]: him to protect what they were really
doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I do know, from first-hand experience,
that there was a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_15]: government disinformation involved and
that a large proportion of what we are
[SPEAKER_15]: hearing today about malevolent aliens,
underground bases, secret treaties with
[SPEAKER_15]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government, has its roots firmly planted
in the Benowitz affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: Stories of an alleged UFO crash at Aztec
New Mexico are also a part of this
[SPEAKER_15]: picture, but I'll save comment on that
until later in this paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, from what I knew of all of
this, its purpose was strictly to
[SPEAKER_15]: discredit Benowitz and nothing more.
[SPEAKER_15]: What amazes me is that nearly a decade
later, these same stories continue to
[SPEAKER_15]: circulate.
[SPEAKER_15]: Recently, one of the most prominent
figures in the current disinformation wave
[SPEAKER_15]: which has been sweeping the UFO community
was quoted as having stated that he found
[SPEAKER_15]: all Benowitz's information to be 100%
true.
[SPEAKER_15]: This person spent a couple of days talking
to Benowitz back in the summer of 1987,
[SPEAKER_15]: and he has spent considerable time since,
spreading elaborate and increasingly
[SPEAKER_15]: sensationalistic stories based,
he claims, on information gathered from a
[SPEAKER_15]: variety of unnamed sources.
[SPEAKER_15]: Strip away the fluff and what you have
left is essentially the Benowitz story all
[SPEAKER_15]: over again.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no question in my mind that it's
mostly disinformation, pure and simple.
[SPEAKER_15]: And since I know that connections exist
between those who are spreading it now and
[SPEAKER_15]: those who are spreading it then,
both from the Benowitz angle and from
[SPEAKER_15]: within the intelligence community,
it seems reasonable to conclude that those
[SPEAKER_15]: responsible for it are not satisfied their
task has been completed even after all
[SPEAKER_15]: this time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Knowing what is going on, however,
is simply not enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: The real question is why.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just that question I asked myself
when I first ran into the disinformation
[SPEAKER_15]: operation that was being run on Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: It seemed to me, at that time,
that I was in a rather unique position.
[SPEAKER_15]: There I was, with my foot literally in the
door of a secret counter-intelligence game
[SPEAKER_15]: that gave every appearance of being
somehow directly connected to a high-level
[SPEAKER_15]: government UFO project.
[SPEAKER_15]: And judging by the positions of the people
I knew to be directly involved with it,
[SPEAKER_15]: definitely had something to do with
national security.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no way I was going to allow the
opportunity to pass me by without learning
[SPEAKER_15]: at least something about what was going
on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Many ufologists have run up against
disinformation over the years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Virtually all of them viewed it as a
negative process and backed away from it
[SPEAKER_15]: either in anger or disgust as soon as they
discovered what they were dealing with.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even today, the UFO community unanimously
considers anyone known or suspected
[SPEAKER_15]: dealing in disinformation to be one of the
bad guys, someone to be shunned or avoided
[SPEAKER_15]: at all costs, and certainly never ever to
be believed.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, on the other hand, determined to take
quite a different tack.
[SPEAKER_15]: I would play the disinformation game,
get my hands dirty just often enough to
[SPEAKER_15]: lead those directing the process into
believing that I was doing exactly what
[SPEAKER_15]: they wanted me to do, and all the while
continue to burrow my way into the matrix
[SPEAKER_15]: so as to learn as much as possible about
who was directing it and why.
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be a classic case of turning the
tables on the very ones who were most
[SPEAKER_15]: confident that they had the situation well
in hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was just one thing I needed to do
this.
[SPEAKER_15]: Secrecy.
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't tell anyone about what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: For if I did and word got back to those in
control, I would be immediately cut off
[SPEAKER_15]: and cast adrift before I could learn
anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a formidable problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the contacts I had made during the
Benowitz affair seemed friendly and
[SPEAKER_15]: professed a desire to end the UFO cover up
and assist in getting government
[SPEAKER_15]: information on UFOs out to the public in a
slow and methodical manner so as not to
[SPEAKER_15]: create panic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Others seemed more interested in obtaining
information from me, often on what other
[SPEAKER_15]: members of the UFO community were doing
and sometimes on other completely
[SPEAKER_15]: unrelated subjects.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever information I managed to get from
these individuals in return usually came
[SPEAKER_15]: as a result of asking just the right
questions in just the right ways.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes it took months or even years of
establishing a relationship with someone
[SPEAKER_15]: before anything useful came from it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The most difficult part of it all was
trying to determine what was real and what
[SPEAKER_15]: was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the key factors in any successful
disinformation scheme is that it must
[SPEAKER_15]: contain some elements of truth in order to
make it credible.
[SPEAKER_15]: Knowing that however is one thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Doing something with it is quite another.
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're dealing with what you know to
be a classified program and you're
[SPEAKER_15]: determined to get information without
breaking any laws and running a foul of
[SPEAKER_15]: national security, you're walking a very
fine line and that's why it takes a long
[SPEAKER_15]: time to get results.
[SPEAKER_15]: In June of 1982, I approached my friend
Jamie Chanderay and brought him into the
[SPEAKER_15]: project.
[SPEAKER_15]: At that time, I also began briefing
Stanton as to what was going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both of them knew that I was in contact
with a number of people within the
[SPEAKER_15]: intelligence community on the subject of
UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And both were aware that at least some of
the information coming through was
[SPEAKER_15]: disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: But both only had minimal knowledge of the
private goals and conclusions I had
[SPEAKER_15]: established some months earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: As the project progressed, this actually
turned out to be more of an asset than a
[SPEAKER_15]: drawback.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, the three of us were an excellent
team in that we each approached the
[SPEAKER_15]: problem from a different angle.
[SPEAKER_15]: From my point of view, the process was one
of slowly and methodically burrowing into
[SPEAKER_15]: a beehive from the outside with a goal of
ultimately reaching the queen bee in the
[SPEAKER_15]: royal jelly at the center.
[SPEAKER_15]: Since I never knew whether the other bees
I was certain to meet along the way would
[SPEAKER_15]: be friendly or not.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to proceed cautiously, both in order
to avoid getting stung and to learn as
[SPEAKER_15]: much as possible about what might lie
ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: The control factor as I saw it,
rested largely with me and the way I
[SPEAKER_15]: proceeded.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, on the other hand, saw it as a
somewhat different process.
[SPEAKER_15]: He too felt we were burrowing into a
beehive.
[SPEAKER_15]: But in his view of things, our burrowing
was at the express invitation of the queen
[SPEAKER_15]: bee herself, who clandestinely oversaw and
encouraged the process from a distance as
[SPEAKER_15]: part of her private plan to get free of
politics that surrounds and restrains her.
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as we followed the signposts along
the way, Jamie felt, the learning process
[SPEAKER_15]: would continue and we could never get
stung.
[SPEAKER_15]: Stanton, as the scientist of the group,
was the one best qualified to conduct a
[SPEAKER_15]: careful and organized search for
corroborating witnesses and evidence in
[SPEAKER_15]: places outside of the loop Jamie and I
were part of.
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, just as a matter of
personal privilege here, I would like to
[SPEAKER_15]: react to a nasty comment about Stanton
which appeared in a recent issue of Jim
[SPEAKER_15]: Mosley's saucer smear newsletter.
[SPEAKER_15]: In this comment, the writer, after first
characterizing Stanton as a gullible
[SPEAKER_15]: individual, went on to wonder whether he
could be trusted to expose the MJ-12
[SPEAKER_15]: documents as phony if his research turned
up conclusive evidence to that effect.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a legitimate question and I'd like to
answer it by stating that not only Stanton
[SPEAKER_15]: but all of us are firmly committed to
releasing a full and complete report on
[SPEAKER_15]: this matter.
[SPEAKER_15]: If evidence should come to light,
suggesting that the documents are phony,
[SPEAKER_15]: you have my firm assurance that it will
most certainly be included in the report.
[SPEAKER_15]: Gullibility is not an issue here.
[SPEAKER_15]: The matter is far larger than that.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, Stanton, Jamie and I are all
working toward the same goal, that of
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to discover what is truth and what
isn't with respect to the government and
[SPEAKER_15]: UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: My role in the Benowitz affair had at
least secured me a seat in the right
[SPEAKER_15]: theater.
[SPEAKER_15]: From there, it was only a question of
whether I could use my balcony ticket to
[SPEAKER_15]: discover who owned the place and was
making the major operational decisions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Both Jamie and I felt that in order to
have any hope of success at all,
[SPEAKER_15]: we absolutely had to play the game
according to their rules.
[SPEAKER_15]: That meant doing everything possible to
give the appearance that we were
[SPEAKER_15]: essentially useful idiots who would cause
no trouble while at the same time playing
[SPEAKER_15]: the double game of keeping our eyes and
ears open in order to learn as much as we
[SPEAKER_15]: could about what was going on.
[SPEAKER_15]: In so doing, we were gradually able to
expand our base of friendly contact people
[SPEAKER_15]: while working our way further and further
into the truly bizarre intelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: labyrinth that surrounds the subject of
UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no problem in telling you that it's
been a tedious time and resource consuming
[SPEAKER_15]: task which has been made all the more
difficult by the constant barrage of
[SPEAKER_15]: rocks, hoots and bottles thrown in our
direction from a segment of the UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: community, which out of ignorance chose to
take up unfriendly and unsympathetic
[SPEAKER_15]: positions toward us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Were it not for the fact that we were
constantly challenged by the twists and
[SPEAKER_15]: turns of our project and by the hope that
we could ultimately come away from it with
[SPEAKER_15]: a smoking gun in hand, I'm convinced we
would have thrown in the towel along time
[SPEAKER_15]: ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, I must admit that there were
several occasions when we tried to do just
[SPEAKER_15]: that, only to be encouraged to continue by
some of our friends from the inside who
[SPEAKER_15]: had come to believe in what we were doing
and respected us for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The anonymous arrival of the so-called
MJ-12 documents in December of 1984 was
[SPEAKER_15]: another factor we had to contend with in
this increasingly confusing web.
[SPEAKER_15]: The problem of their origin and
authenticity was and remains a major
[SPEAKER_15]: issue.
[SPEAKER_15]: And on this point, our position of
neutrality has constantly been
[SPEAKER_15]: misinterpreted.
[SPEAKER_15]: Therefore, for the record, it is important
to point out here once again that at no
[SPEAKER_15]: time have either I or any of my associates
ever stated that these documents are
[SPEAKER_15]: authentic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Our position has consistently been that we
do not know whether they are authentic,
[SPEAKER_15]: but that we as investigators remain
unaware of any convincing evidence which
[SPEAKER_15]: would suggest that they are not.
[SPEAKER_15]: That position remains essentially
unchanged today, and I'll have more to say
[SPEAKER_15]: about it when I get to the end of this
paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line, however, is that
authentic or not, the story of the
[SPEAKER_15]: documents is a major story.
[SPEAKER_15]: And one which, as I've already assured
you, will ultimately be told when the time
[SPEAKER_15]: is ready to tell it.
[SPEAKER_15]: That process has already taken
considerably longer than I had thought it
[SPEAKER_15]: would.
[SPEAKER_15]: I cannot predict when it will be complete,
but I can say that progress has been made.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, for one, certainly hope it won't be
too much longer.
[SPEAKER_15]: For the many of you who have roundly
criticized our methodology throughout the
[SPEAKER_15]: MJ-12 controversy, it seems important to
note here that what you were witnessing
[SPEAKER_15]: was the operation of a plan to put out
just enough of this bizarre information to
[SPEAKER_15]: attract attention, and then carefully
monitor who showed up with questions to
[SPEAKER_15]: ask or information to offer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, I was careful to state that I
remained unconvinced of the authenticity
[SPEAKER_15]: of the information involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the case of the Falcon and Condor
interviews broadcast last October on UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: cover-up live, I'm convinced that at least
some of that information falls under the
[SPEAKER_15]: category of disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm equally convinced that some of it is
true.
[SPEAKER_15]: The important point here is that
regardless of whether it is disinformation
[SPEAKER_15]: or truth, it does have to do with UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the sources who provided it felt that
doing so was important enough to risk
[SPEAKER_15]: going before national television in order
to accomplish that purpose.
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember also that those sources knew that
Falcon and Condor would be identified on
[SPEAKER_15]: the show as confidential government
informants.
[SPEAKER_15]: The risk was all theirs, not ours.
[SPEAKER_15]: And still, they went ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just as they are currently going ahead
with the process of arranging a meeting,
[SPEAKER_15]: which will enable them to tell their
stories before one or more members of
[SPEAKER_15]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_15]: I submit to you that such a process is
extraordinary, regardless of the truth or
[SPEAKER_15]: deception involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's high time the UFO
community stopped throwing rocks at it and
[SPEAKER_15]: began to consider the implications.
[SPEAKER_15]: One thing I can assure you is that rocks
or not, our project will continue.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can either become involved,
as others in the UFO community have done,
[SPEAKER_15]: or you can sit back and wait for results.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever those results, good, bad,
positive or negative, you will hear about
[SPEAKER_15]: them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Our trolling of the bait by means of a
progressive release of information and
[SPEAKER_15]: ultimately by arranging for Falcon and
Condor to appear on the UFO Cover-Up Live
[SPEAKER_15]: show, produced a variety of interesting
results.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shortly after the show, the FBI showed up
and began asking questions about it.
[SPEAKER_15]: They even arranged for a private showing
in the office of producer Michael
[SPEAKER_15]: Seligman.
[SPEAKER_15]: Agents on both East and West Coasts
interviewed a number of ufologists and
[SPEAKER_15]: other people, including Jamie Chanderay.
[SPEAKER_15]: But although I let it be known that I'd be
more than happy to talk to them,
[SPEAKER_15]: they avoided it.
[SPEAKER_15]: This I found to be particularly
interesting in light of the FBI's
[SPEAKER_15]: admission in response to a FOIA request
that they have nearly 60 pages of material
[SPEAKER_15]: on me that is all classified for reasons
of national security.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in July of 1988.
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have no idea what those pages
contain.
[SPEAKER_15]: Another thing that occurred, as we had
hoped it would, was that a rather small
[SPEAKER_15]: number of people came out of the woodwork
claiming to have inside knowledge of one
[SPEAKER_15]: type or another about MJ-12 or similar
government UFO projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: After weeding out the obvious cranks and
several others whose claims did not check
[SPEAKER_15]: out, or whose stories changed every time
they told them, we were left with a few
[SPEAKER_15]: leads which seemed promising.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's premature to offer you a report on
these at this time because we're still
[SPEAKER_15]: checking.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, seemingly in direct relationship to
our partial release of MJ-12, 12 material
[SPEAKER_15]: two years ago, the flow of UFO-related
disinformation has escalated from a point
[SPEAKER_15]: of near insignificance to what has become
almost a flood tide.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, many of you in the audience came
here tonight looking for answers to
[SPEAKER_15]: questions related directly to that
problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: As I have taken great pains to point out,
the current crop of disinformation is
[SPEAKER_15]: really nothing new.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that a different crop of people
are spreading it this time around.
[SPEAKER_15]: I expect that those responsible,
not the rumor mongers themselves,
[SPEAKER_15]: but the ones who are feeding them,
thought it would work just as well this
[SPEAKER_15]: time as it did last.
[SPEAKER_15]: The one thing I'm sure they didn't count
on is that I would tell my story and thus
[SPEAKER_15]: blow their cover.
[SPEAKER_15]: And speaking of blowing cover,
[SPEAKER_15]: and speaking of blowing cover,
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's high time that I tell you
what I know about another situation that
[SPEAKER_15]: has found its way into the current crop of
UFO disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: I offer this not to embarrass the person
involved, but rather to shed light on an
[SPEAKER_15]: incident which by the accounts of it have
appeared recently in a variety of UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: newsletters and at least one new book.
[SPEAKER_15]: As take rumor, Rick indicated he'd do
nothing about the matter and asked me to
[SPEAKER_15]: tell him everything I could.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did so, and as I recall, he took some
notes.
[SPEAKER_15]: We discussed a number of other things as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some months later, in early 1983,
I became aware that Rick was involved with
[SPEAKER_15]: a team of several others, including one
fellow from Denver that I knew of,
[SPEAKER_15]: and at least one who was working out of
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_15]: in playing an elaborate disinformation
game against a prominent cattle mutilation
[SPEAKER_15]: researcher who, at the time, had close
connections with a major television film
[SPEAKER_15]: company interested in doing a UFO
documentary.
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I was not in a position to know
everything about what was going on,
[SPEAKER_15]: I had access to enough of it to conclude
that the government seemed hell-bent on
[SPEAKER_15]: severing the ties that existed between the
researcher and the film company.
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding was that because the
researcher was known to have close ties to
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz and had exhibited a strong
interest in his work, certain elements
[SPEAKER_15]: within the intelligence community were
concerned that the story of his having
[SPEAKER_15]: intercepted electromagnetic emissions from
the Kirtland-Sandia area would end up as
[SPEAKER_15]: part of the script of a feature film.
[SPEAKER_15]: Since this, in turn, might influence
others, possibly even the Soviets,
[SPEAKER_15]: to attempt similar interceptions,
someone in a control position apparently
[SPEAKER_15]: felt it had to be stopped before it got
out of hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, the prime objective of the
counterintelligence people who swarmed
[SPEAKER_15]: around Benowitz between 1980 and 1984
seemed to be the maintenance of a
[SPEAKER_15]: high-level security net around the radio
signals he was intercepting.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was unable to determine why this was a
priority at the time, and I still do not
[SPEAKER_15]: know today.
[SPEAKER_15]: What I do know, however, is that since
they couldn't physically stop Paul from
[SPEAKER_15]: intercepting these signals, and since they
hadn't been successful in enlisting his
[SPEAKER_15]: voluntary silence, they fell back on a
wall of disinformation as the best way to
[SPEAKER_15]: confuse the issue and ultimately to call
his credibility into question.
[SPEAKER_15]: When the filmmaker appeared on the scene,
and it looked as if Paul's story might
[SPEAKER_15]: become part of the script, the
counterintelligence people simply extended
[SPEAKER_15]: their disinformation activities
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of this game involved a meeting
between the cattle mutilation researcher
[SPEAKER_15]: in question, Agent Richard Doty,
and others at the AFOSI office at Kirtland
[SPEAKER_15]: Air Force Base, wherein the researcher
subsequently claimed to have been allowed
[SPEAKER_15]: to view certain purportedly sensitive
documents about the government's alleged
[SPEAKER_15]: involvement with UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of this material included information
about an alleged UFO crash retrieval at
[SPEAKER_15]: Aztec.
[SPEAKER_15]: Richard Doty, who's bound by a security
oath, cannot and I am told will not
[SPEAKER_15]: discuss this matter, except to say that he
broke no laws and gave away no secrets
[SPEAKER_15]: that day.
[SPEAKER_15]: That, insofar as I'm aware, is entirely
correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: I, on the other hand, was never required
to sign a security oath and am therefore
[SPEAKER_15]: breaking no laws when I tell you quite
candidly that the information which
[SPEAKER_15]: changed hands on that day was directly
descended from the discussion Doty and I
[SPEAKER_15]: had had only a few months earlier.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can also tell you that it was a very
effective deception because the researcher
[SPEAKER_15]: involved continues to believe this
information and actively continues to try
[SPEAKER_15]: to convince others of its truth even now
more than six years after the fact.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, there was no UFO crash at
Aztec, nor was there much truth to any of
[SPEAKER_15]: the other materials supplied to this
particular researcher, either at that
[SPEAKER_15]: meeting or during later encounters.
[SPEAKER_15]: The much-touted alien harvest is really a
dismal crop failure.
[SPEAKER_15]: To the best of my knowledge, it was all
disinformation, and I was the unfortunate
[SPEAKER_15]: one who had unwittingly supplied the fuel
to those who were spreading the fire.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've held my silence on this matter for
more than six years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you know the truth.
[SPEAKER_15]: Disinformation is a strange and bizarre
game.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who play it are completely aware
that an operation's success is dependent
[SPEAKER_15]: upon dropping information upon a target or
mark in such a way that the person will
[SPEAKER_15]: accept it as truth and will repeat and
even defend it to others as if it were
[SPEAKER_15]: true.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once this has been accomplished,
we certainly have a number of rude people
[SPEAKER_15]: in this audience.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once this has been accomplished,
the work of the counterintelligence
[SPEAKER_15]: specialist is complete.
[SPEAKER_15]: They can simply withdraw in the confidence
that the dirty work of spreading their
[SPEAKER_15]: poison seeds will be done by others.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who want proof of how well the
process works need only look around you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time one of you repeats an
unverified or unsubstantiated bit of
[SPEAKER_15]: information without qualifying it as such,
you are contributing to that process,
[SPEAKER_15]: and every time you do it, somebody in a
need-to-know position sits back and has a
[SPEAKER_15]: horse laugh at your expense.
[SPEAKER_15]: One final comment on the Aztec hoax is
that two other individuals who
[SPEAKER_15]: self-published a voluminous book,
UFO Crash at Aztec, on the affair in 1987,
[SPEAKER_15]: chose to completely omit any mention of my
extensive research on the case which had
[SPEAKER_15]: been published two years earlier and which
both researchers had copies of.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a classic case of the book's
principal author having decided what his
[SPEAKER_15]: conclusion would be before even beginning
the process of investigating and then
[SPEAKER_15]: ignoring everything which didn't fit.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the problems the ufology movement
has with its image is that there are a
[SPEAKER_15]: significant number of people involved with
it who not only support this sort of
[SPEAKER_15]: journalism, but encourage it.
[SPEAKER_15]: The next section of this presentation will
deal with questions and answers,
[SPEAKER_15]: but the format will be a bit different in
that I will not take questions from the
[SPEAKER_15]: audience, but have elected to incorporate
a number of questions and their answers
[SPEAKER_15]: directly into the body of this paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question number one.
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I currently involved with providing
information to any government agency about
[SPEAKER_15]: UFOs or about people involved with the UFO
phenomena?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not had any such involvement since
1984.
[SPEAKER_09]: Frankly, I'm a little ashamed of some
people in this audience, regardless of
[SPEAKER_09]: what you believe, what you hear,
or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not a debate.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a paper trying to be presented.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now please show a little courtesy.
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll repeat that question.
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I currently involved with providing
information to any government agency about
[SPEAKER_15]: UFOs or about people involved with the UFO
phenomena?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not had any such involvement since
1984.
[SPEAKER_15]: The extent and the scope of that
involvement were essentially as I have
[SPEAKER_15]: already outlined to you and nothing more.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question two.
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I presently involved in knowingly
spreading any sort of disinformation about
[SPEAKER_15]: UFOs?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: The only conscious involvement I have ever
had with a disinformation operation was
[SPEAKER_15]: that which I have already outlined in
connection with the Benowitz case.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question three.
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I presently or have I ever been on the
payroll of any agency of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, no.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question four.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about my involvement with UFO
researcher Lee Graham?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Earlier in this paper, I told you of how I
was recruited to supply information on Mr.
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz in 1980.
[SPEAKER_15]: The exact wording of my statement was,
Benowitz and to a lesser extent,
[SPEAKER_15]: several other individuals.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of those other individuals was Lee
Graham.
[SPEAKER_15]: This began in 1983 if memory serves.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's important to note here that in
addition to being a UFO researcher,
[SPEAKER_15]: Lee is also an avid military aircraft
buff.
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as I'm aware, the
counterintelligence people were primarily
[SPEAKER_15]: interested in him because of the time Lee
was making a lot of inquiries and
[SPEAKER_15]: collecting a great deal of information on
the then very highly classified stealth
[SPEAKER_15]: aircraft program.
[SPEAKER_15]: Apparently, there was some question as to
why he was so interested in obtaining
[SPEAKER_15]: information on so sensitive a subject.
[SPEAKER_15]: In other words, was he using it solely to
satisfy a personal curiosity or was he
[SPEAKER_15]: passing it on to others who perhaps had
foreign intelligence connections?
[SPEAKER_15]: There seemed to be only minimal interest
in his UFO activities.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lee is a completely aboveboard individual
who is a loyal U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: citizen.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the process of keeping in touch with
him, we became good friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: His knowledge of the fact that I had
friends in the intelligence community
[SPEAKER_15]: gradually evolved into the firm belief on
his part that I was much more than I
[SPEAKER_15]: really was.
[SPEAKER_15]: The ID card story, which has become the
subject of so much speculation lately,
[SPEAKER_15]: stems from nothing more than a practical
joke which has simply gotten out of hand.
[SPEAKER_15]: Since the story surrounding it is somewhat
longer than the time here will allow,
[SPEAKER_15]: I will commit to publishing it later in
our newsletter so that it will be on
[SPEAKER_15]: record for anyone interested in the facts.
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact is, I do not hold a government ID
card.
[SPEAKER_15]: But think about it for just one moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: If I did, does it make sense that I'd pull
it out of my wallet and show it to Lee
[SPEAKER_15]: Graham or anybody else for that matter?
[SPEAKER_15]: Question five.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it true that several hours of
interviews with the source code named
[SPEAKER_15]: Falcon were videotaped, some in the
presence of bona fide members of the news
[SPEAKER_15]: media?
[SPEAKER_15]: And is it true, as some have alleged,
that those tapes were confiscated by the U
[SPEAKER_15]: .S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it is true that those tapes were
made.
[SPEAKER_15]: And no, it is not true that they were
confiscated.
[SPEAKER_15]: They are still in our possession.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question six.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it true that I've characterized the
cattle mutilation phenomenon as a hoax?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question seven.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I know anything about the so-called
Ellsworth Air Force Base humanoid case of
[SPEAKER_15]: 1977 and the documents associated with it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people have characterized this case
as a hoax, while others have attributed it
[SPEAKER_15]: to official disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my position that this was a special
counterintelligence training exercise in
[SPEAKER_15]: the creation and dissemination of
disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yes, Richard Doty, who was stationed
at Ellsworth at the time, was clearly a
[SPEAKER_15]: part of it, but not in any capacity where
he would have been responsible for
[SPEAKER_15]: creating the documents involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question eight.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I know anything about the so-called
Whitesill letter?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: The letter, which is loosely based upon an
actual UFO case, was written anonymously
[SPEAKER_15]: to APRO in July of 1980.
[SPEAKER_15]: By Richard Doty.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is directly related to the Benowitz
affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: Essentially, it was bait.
[SPEAKER_15]: AFOSI knew that Benowitz had close ties
with the APRO organization at the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were interested in recruiting
someone within the organization who would
[SPEAKER_15]: be in a position to provide them with
feedback on Benowitz's activities and
[SPEAKER_15]: communications.
[SPEAKER_15]: Since I was an APRO board member,
the Whitesill letter was passed to me for
[SPEAKER_15]: action.
[SPEAKER_15]: Shortly after it had been received,
it was not long thereafter that I came to
[SPEAKER_15]: know Richard Doty and began to provide him
with information about Benowitz and his
[SPEAKER_15]: case.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question nine.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do I know about the so-called
Aquarius document, which purports to be a
[SPEAKER_15]: facsimile AFOSI message with a few
spurious additions?
[SPEAKER_15]: I neither typed nor retyped this document.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was created by AFOSI, or at least I
always assumed it was, and it was handed
[SPEAKER_15]: to me in February 1981 with the intention
that I would pass it to Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding, although I never knew
for sure, was that Benowitz was expected
[SPEAKER_15]: to wave it to the press and others as
proof of what he was saying about an alien
[SPEAKER_15]: invasion, at which point the document
would be denounced as a counterfeit and
[SPEAKER_15]: Benowitz would be further discredited.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately,
depending upon one's point of view,
[SPEAKER_15]: it didn't turn out that way.
[SPEAKER_15]: A highlighted version of this document
showing the real information and the added
[SPEAKER_15]: information appears in the current issue
of our newsletter, which will be available
[SPEAKER_15]: at our table out in the lobby.
[SPEAKER_15]: I might also add that the entire text of
this speech is also in there.
[SPEAKER_15]: One additional bit of information about
this document is the way that it came to
[SPEAKER_15]: be known to the UFO community.
[SPEAKER_15]: In September of 1982, insofar as I was
aware, there were only three copies of
[SPEAKER_15]: this document in existence.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of these I had given to Benowitz.
[SPEAKER_15]: A second was in safekeeping and a third
was in my briefcase during a trip which I
[SPEAKER_15]: had made to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_15]: While there, I had a morning meeting with
a man who turned out later to be an
[SPEAKER_15]: associate of ufologist Peter Gerstin.
[SPEAKER_15]: That same afternoon, my car was broken
into and the briefcase was stolen.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a police report, by the way,
on file in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_15]: Four months later, a copy of that same
document, complete with annotations I had
[SPEAKER_15]: penciled on it, turned up in the hands of
none other than Gerstin himself.
[SPEAKER_15]: To this day, I have never received a
satisfactory explanation of how he
[SPEAKER_15]: obtained it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 10.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the AFOSI documents which speak
of a 1980 UFO landing near a nuclear
[SPEAKER_15]: storage facility within the Kirtland Air
Force Base complex?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are these documents more disinformation or
are they authentic?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, to the best of my knowledge,
they are authentic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 11.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about other documents which I've
either alluded to having or have published
[SPEAKER_15]: portions of without providing further
details?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, there are a number of these and
they came to us in several different ways.
[SPEAKER_15]: None of them, however, seem to have any
direct connection to the Benowitz case,
[SPEAKER_15]: nor, as far as I can tell, was Richard
Doty directly involved in supplying them
[SPEAKER_15]: to us.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether they are legitimate or
disinformation, they're more likely a
[SPEAKER_15]: combination of both is still a matter of
question.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once we have completed our study of these
materials, we will make them available as
[SPEAKER_15]: well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Our publication of expurgated copies of
some of this material also served a
[SPEAKER_15]: definite purpose, but that's another
story.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question number 12.
[SPEAKER_15]: UFO basher Phil Klass has been the topic
of a number of rumors lately to the effect
[SPEAKER_15]: that he's an active government
disinformation agent.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do I think about that?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer, Mr. Klass is a very astute
individual who has long been a close
[SPEAKER_15]: follower of my activities.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, I believe he was the only one out
of the entire UFO community who managed to
[SPEAKER_15]: figure out what I and my associates were
up to, and it horrified him.
[SPEAKER_15]: In my opinion, the very idea that someone
might actually be capable of getting far
[SPEAKER_15]: enough into the UFO problem to unmask his
debunking plans constituted a personal
[SPEAKER_15]: threat to him that had to be dealt with.
[SPEAKER_15]: He has been obsessed with doing everything
possible to try to either stop or
[SPEAKER_15]: discredit us ever since.
[SPEAKER_15]: The handout he passed around today to many
of you is just another example of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: As to his motives, I think it's best left
to Mr. Klass to explain why he behaves as
[SPEAKER_15]: he does.
[SPEAKER_15]: Perhaps Phil bashes UFOs and the people
who see them for the same reason that
[SPEAKER_15]: other people tear the wings off of flies.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or perhaps he gets well paid to do what he
does.
[SPEAKER_15]: If there is nothing to UFOs as he's
consistently claimed, then I can't imagine
[SPEAKER_15]: why he gets so emotional about them.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless, of course,
[SPEAKER_15]: it's all part of the script.
[SPEAKER_15]: Phil's been bashing UFOs for over 20 years
now.
[SPEAKER_15]: In that process, he's always been very
quick to ascribe ulterior motives to the
[SPEAKER_15]: people who report them and investigate
them.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a lot of people in this audience
who would be very interested in hearing
[SPEAKER_15]: what his ulterior motives are.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why does Mr. Klass bash UFOs?
[SPEAKER_15]: I, for one, would welcome a rational
explanation of just why a man would devote
[SPEAKER_15]: 20 years of his life to an essentially
one-man crusade against something which he
[SPEAKER_15]: claims doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_15]: If he's not spreading this information,
if he's not on some government or private
[SPEAKER_15]: payroll, then just what is he up to and
precisely what does he hope to accomplish
[SPEAKER_15]: by it?
[SPEAKER_15]: How about it, folks?
[SPEAKER_15]: How many of you would like to hear what
makes Klass tick?
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he owes us all an explanation of
what, in my opinion, and I'm sure in that
[SPEAKER_15]: of many others here, has been 20 long
years of unprofessional attitude.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a matter of fact, I think he owes a lot
of people an apology, myself included.
[SPEAKER_15]: Pages of my newsletter are open to you,
Phil.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whenever you're ready to explain yourself,
we'll be more than happy to print it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now having gotten that out of the way,
this seems to be an appropriate place to
[SPEAKER_15]: tell you the story of man's first contact
with the Martians.
[SPEAKER_15]: During a worldwide telecast of the Martian
Ambassadors Press Conference, the
[SPEAKER_15]: following dialogue transpired.
[SPEAKER_15]: Reporter.
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me, Mr. Martian, what sort of social
structure do you have on Mars?
[SPEAKER_15]: Martian.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're all about communists.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no cares or worries in our
society, and we are all extremely happy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Reporter.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what's the one thing about living on
Mars that makes your people the happiest?
[SPEAKER_15]: Martian.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's a very easy question.
[SPEAKER_15]: You see, unlike the people on Earth,
we on Mars enjoy the distinct advantage of
[SPEAKER_15]: living in a completely classless society.
[SPEAKER_15]: So moving from the humorous back to the
serious, here's question 13.
[SPEAKER_15]: What do I think of Whitley Strieber and
his claims of being a UFO abductee?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: At first, I was highly skeptical and
admittedly somewhat jealous of Whitley.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a result, I undertook to get to know
the man in order to assess things for
[SPEAKER_15]: myself.
[SPEAKER_15]: In that process, he's earned my respect,
my admiration, and my friendship.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whitley has come very close to the truth
in a number of ways, and although still
[SPEAKER_15]: somewhat baffled by his own experiences,
he's found a very acceptable way of
[SPEAKER_15]: accommodating them into his life.
[SPEAKER_15]: If one makes a conscious effort to remove
Whitley's emotional reactions and then
[SPEAKER_15]: takes a hard look at the remaining core of
information, the result is an insightful
[SPEAKER_15]: look into what gives every appearance of
being a real situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any event, I certainly wouldn't dismiss
this man too lightly.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to hear a lot more from him
before it's all over.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 14.
[SPEAKER_15]: Jerome Clark reported in Fate magazine
that I and Jamie Chanderay made a trip to
[SPEAKER_15]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_15]: in anticipation of meeting a live alien
and were stood up in the process.
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't this imply that we were highly
gullible individuals and that the
[SPEAKER_15]: experience was probably just a practical
joke on the part of the disinformation
[SPEAKER_15]: crowd?
[SPEAKER_11]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you stop to think about it,
considering what you now know of our
[SPEAKER_15]: project and its goals, we had a story no
matter what happened.
[SPEAKER_15]: We made the trip because we simply
couldn't lose.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then there's more to that experience
than you know about.
[SPEAKER_15]: Once again, let me caution the hasty
pudding crowd not to jump to conclusions
[SPEAKER_15]: until all the facts are in.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 15.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are my plans for the future?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I and my associates will continue our work
and will continue to keep you informed of
[SPEAKER_15]: our results as circumstances warrant.
[SPEAKER_15]: What you've heard today is only part of a
larger body of information.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 16.
[SPEAKER_15]: Assuming they're interested, what can
fellow ufologists do to support our
[SPEAKER_15]: continuing efforts?
[SPEAKER_15]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, what we're doing takes a lot
of time.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Money's not always available.
[SPEAKER_15]: The easiest thing you can do is to make
some contribution to the effort.
[SPEAKER_15]: If not in cash, which by no means do we
request, you might want to offer time,
[SPEAKER_15]: research services.
[SPEAKER_15]: You might have information which you feel
we might be interested in.
[SPEAKER_15]: In any case, feel free to contact us at
any time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Two years ago in Washington DC,
I stated we were looking for help.
[SPEAKER_15]: The response was damn few offers and a lot
of rocks thrown in our direction.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can say to you now that at last
inventory we had plenty of rocks.
[SPEAKER_15]: We still need the help.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you that still have rocks to
throw, allow me to suggest that they might
[SPEAKER_15]: be put to better use by tossing them at
the rumor mongers or the disinformers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Or the incompetence that are presently
running rampant.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those people are the ones that are giving
us a bad image.
[SPEAKER_15]: Question 17.
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the so-called Blue Book 13
report?
[SPEAKER_10]: Answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's best left up to those who are
circulating this material to provide the
[SPEAKER_15]: proof of its authenticity.
[SPEAKER_15]: I remain unconvinced of it, but
open-minded.
[SPEAKER_15]: Which brings me at last to the final
section of this lengthy paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems to me that it's high time I made
my position clear about a few things.
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of people seem to be very interested
in knowing where Bill Moore stands.
[SPEAKER_15]: So here goes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me begin by stating that the positions
presented here are entirely my own.
[SPEAKER_15]: All are based upon evidence obtained by me
and by associates during the course of our
[SPEAKER_15]: project.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of that has been made available
already.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some is provided for the first time in
this paper.
[SPEAKER_15]: And some remains to be released at a
later, more appropriate time.
[SPEAKER_15]: As to the existence and depth of that
which is yet to be released, you'll just
[SPEAKER_15]: have to take my word for the time being.
[SPEAKER_15]: To the best of my knowledge, everything
here is true.
[SPEAKER_15]: Indeed, although I confess to having
practiced an occasional deception now and
[SPEAKER_15]: again over the years in order to protect
the integrity of what I was doing,
[SPEAKER_15]: our goal from the very beginning was to
keep things as aboveboard as possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: After all, ours is a search for answers,
not an effort to create more mysteries.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position number one is that a highly
advanced extraterrestrial civilization is
[SPEAKER_15]: visiting planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_15]: And is actively manipulating our awareness
of their presence here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position number two.
[SPEAKER_15]: Elements of at least two of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government's intelligence agencies are
aware of this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And both are presently conducting highly
classified ongoing research projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you without reservation that at
least one of these efforts, and possibly
[SPEAKER_15]: both, has access to electromagnetic
optical and infrared signature data which,
[SPEAKER_15]: if released to the public, would provide
proof positive that some UFOs represent
[SPEAKER_15]: somebody else's highly advanced
technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I can't tell you more at
this time.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish I could.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you who find me competent and
credible will take this as a revelation,
[SPEAKER_15]: which is as it should be.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who hold others in their opinions
will continue to throw rocks while loudly
[SPEAKER_15]: demanding at the same time that I deliver
proof positive into their hands in a
[SPEAKER_15]: silver platter so that they can call it
their own and claim credit for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Patience, my friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position three.
[SPEAKER_15]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_15]: government counterintelligence people have
conducted an on-again, off-again campaign
[SPEAKER_15]: of deception and disinformation about the
UFO phenomenon for more than 40 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who have been responsible for such
operations are highly placed individuals
[SPEAKER_15]: within at least two separate agencies.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there does seem to be a degree of
cooperation between them.
[SPEAKER_15]: These operations involve a large number of
people and are well organized.
[SPEAKER_15]: They also include the use of phony
documents and the recruiting of informants
[SPEAKER_15]: who are able to provide information on the
activities of people conducting UFO
[SPEAKER_15]: research or who have had UFO experiences.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_15]: My experience suggests five different
reasons.
[SPEAKER_15]: A, that disinformation provides security
cover for a real UFO project which exists
[SPEAKER_15]: at a very high level and is known only to
an elite few.
[SPEAKER_15]: B, it is also useful as part of a security
process designed to develop and divert
[SPEAKER_15]: attention away from real but non-UFO
related high-tech research and development
[SPEAKER_15]: projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: C, it is a manipulation by a group of
highly placed and well-to-do individuals
[SPEAKER_15]: like the trilateralists who espouse a
one-world philosophy and who are using the
[SPEAKER_15]: UFO phenomenon in an effort to bring about
world unity in the face of an unknown
[SPEAKER_15]: threat from space.
[SPEAKER_15]: D, it provides a convenient way to train
counter-intelligence agents in the
[SPEAKER_15]: techniques of deception and
disinformation.
[SPEAKER_15]: E, it is a manipulation by UFO aliens
themselves as part of their plan to
[SPEAKER_15]: gradually make human society aware of
their presence.
[SPEAKER_15]: My position is that the truth is better.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether those people are witting or
unwitting tools of this process I do not
[SPEAKER_15]: know.
[SPEAKER_15]: The best thing the disinformation people
expected however is that someone who knew
[SPEAKER_15]: of their activities with the Benowitz
affair would pop up after so many years
[SPEAKER_15]: and burst their balloon.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position four.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been able to confirm that there is
in fact a group known as MJ-12 which
[SPEAKER_15]: operates at the White House National
Security Council level.
[SPEAKER_15]: To the best of my knowledge this group
still uses MJ-12 as the designator.
[SPEAKER_15]: The level of security around this group is
such that we have not yet succeeded in
[SPEAKER_15]: establishing whether or not its functions
are UFO related or even precisely how long
[SPEAKER_15]: the group has existed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Along these same lines none of our sources
has indicated any knowledge whatsoever
[SPEAKER_15]: with terms such as magi majesty,
PI-40, Plato, garnet or a number of other
[SPEAKER_15]: terms currently being spread by certain
elements.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position five.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is in fact a project Aquarius.
[SPEAKER_15]: Possibly two of them.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have succeeded in obtaining
considerable information about one such
[SPEAKER_15]: project in the 1971-73 time frame and
sketchy information about another which
[SPEAKER_15]: may be a later extension of the first one
in the 1976-85 time frame.
[SPEAKER_15]: This information includes contract and
report numbers as well as the names of
[SPEAKER_15]: several individuals who worked on the
project.
[SPEAKER_15]: More details will be forthcoming later.
[SPEAKER_15]: Meanwhile it ill behoves UFO researchers
to deluge the government with freedom of
[SPEAKER_15]: information requests for details of
sensitive high level projects.
[SPEAKER_15]: This simply alerts the public powers that
be that you are on to them and thus makes
[SPEAKER_15]: it all the more difficult to obtain
information through other channels.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the rush for me first in the UFO
community we are often our own worst
[SPEAKER_15]: enemies.
[SPEAKER_15]: Discretion is the better part of valor.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position six.
[SPEAKER_15]: With respect to the controversial MJ-12
papers these have now been examined by a
[SPEAKER_15]: number of question documents experts.
[SPEAKER_15]: And other research on them is continuing
as well as you've just heard from my
[SPEAKER_15]: friend Stanton.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the case of the Cutler-Twining memo
found in the National Archives I can state
[SPEAKER_15]: with reasonable certainty that it is an
authentic document.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the best evidence indicates that
someone planted it amidst the papers of
[SPEAKER_15]: record group 341 knowing that there was a
strong chance we would find it there.
[SPEAKER_15]: With respect to this open called
Eisenhower briefing document there is
[SPEAKER_15]: still no compelling reason to believe it
is anything but authentic.
[SPEAKER_15]: On the other hand its authenticity remains
far from proved.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in the final analysis the scale remains
balanced by the weight of arguments on
[SPEAKER_15]: both sides.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's the real thing it's going to take
extraordinary evidence to convince even
[SPEAKER_15]: some of the more liberal skeptics.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's a hoax it's extraordinarily well
done.
[SPEAKER_15]: Much better than the sort of
disinformation I encountered in connection
[SPEAKER_15]: with the Benowitz case.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course it still may be disinformation
but then again it may not.
[SPEAKER_15]: Either way there's a major story here and
the controversy is far from over.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's real it speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's disinformation the equally
important story of why needs to be told.
[SPEAKER_15]: As for the so-called Truman executive
order of September 24 1947 which is
[SPEAKER_15]: actually the final page of the portion of
the Eisenhower document which we have the
[SPEAKER_15]: analysts have come up with mixed results.
[SPEAKER_15]: Though not yet disproved this document
presents the weakest case of the three.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are working on a final report on this
matter which will include the results of
[SPEAKER_15]: typeface analysis and other processes.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be a lengthy affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: Before leaving it however I would like to
at least comment on what has emerged as
[SPEAKER_15]: the most controversial aspect of the MJ-12
document affair.
[SPEAKER_15]: That of the date format.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a couple of points I would like
to make.
[SPEAKER_15]: One.
[SPEAKER_15]: If the similarities between stylistic
characteristics of the documents and my
[SPEAKER_15]: own writings are important as some have
claimed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Then are not dissimilarities equally
important?
[SPEAKER_15]: There are some you know.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even in the way the dates are written.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why do those who go to such pains to point
out similarities not go to equal pains to
[SPEAKER_15]: point out dissimilarities especially when
they claim to be using the scientific
[SPEAKER_15]: method?
[SPEAKER_15]: Who did I wonder be prejudiced?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or does the word incompetence better
describe it?
[SPEAKER_15]: We are by no means convinced that the date
format is as critical an issue as others
[SPEAKER_15]: would make it out to be.
[SPEAKER_15]: While the style is admittedly unusual it
is not without precedent.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that of course is the bottom line
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Three.
[SPEAKER_15]: To those of you who still harbor
suspicions that I created the documents
[SPEAKER_15]: and am perpetrating a hoax.
[SPEAKER_15]: I say thank you for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_15]: To those of you who think it more likely
that I am the innocent victim of an
[SPEAKER_15]: elaborate hoax.
[SPEAKER_15]: I concede that this remains a possibility
which has not yet been entirely ruled out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position seven.
[SPEAKER_15]: The matter of alien abductions of humans
is apparently regarded as serious by those
[SPEAKER_15]: within the government who are aware of the
extraterrestrial nature of UFOs.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is evidenced by the fact that the
government has gone so far as to disinform
[SPEAKER_15]: its own counter-intelligence people on
that very subject.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position eight.
[SPEAKER_15]: The secret behind the government UFO
cover-up is essentially an awareness of
[SPEAKER_15]: what UFOs are by a few people in high
places who have connections with the
[SPEAKER_15]: National Security Council and the White
House.
[SPEAKER_15]: Widespread publicity about the abduction
phenomenon is an unwarranty in what is
[SPEAKER_15]: already a difficult situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Within the in-group there are strong
differences of opinion as to whether
[SPEAKER_15]: information should be released to the
public and how fast.
[SPEAKER_15]: There seems to be some consternation about
exactly who is in control of the
[SPEAKER_15]: situation.
[SPEAKER_15]: Position nine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ufology has been stumbling around for 30
years looking for answers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless something is done to reduce the
petty bickering, the rumor-mongering,
[SPEAKER_15]: the name-calling, the ego-massaging,
the power politics and the personal
[SPEAKER_15]: vendettas which have been taking up our
time, sapping our strength and disgracing
[SPEAKER_15]: our image lately, I expect mainstream
ufology will go right on stumbling for a
[SPEAKER_15]: long time to come.
[SPEAKER_15]: What is needed, I submit, is a society of
professional ufologists which adheres to
[SPEAKER_15]: established research procedures and
techniques which maintains a rigorous set
[SPEAKER_15]: of ethics and standards in which limits
its membership to a few whose competence
[SPEAKER_15]: has been appropriately demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter what happens, however,
I am committed to completing the process I
[SPEAKER_15]: have begun.
[SPEAKER_15]: I am presently working with a network of
more than a dozen individuals,
[SPEAKER_15]: some of whom hold some very impressive
credentials.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been actively exploring the
labyrinth of government UFO involvement.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will continue to do so until we
feel the task is complete or that we can
[SPEAKER_15]: go no further.
[SPEAKER_15]: Our group is euphemistically called the
Aviary and each individual uses a code
[SPEAKER_15]: name of a bird as an identifier.
[SPEAKER_15]: We will continue to provide the UFO
community with data and we will continue
[SPEAKER_15]: to proceed in a way which we feel best
suits our purposes.
[SPEAKER_15]: A number of people have suggested to me
recently that I should defend myself
[SPEAKER_15]: against various allegations and rumors
which have been circulating lately.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, folks, you've just heard the case
for the defense.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now reach down inside of yourselves and
wrench forth a judgment.
[SPEAKER_15]: I and my group of associates are going to
find some answers, no matter what it takes
[SPEAKER_15]: and no matter how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are out there digging and we are going
to continue to dig, either with the
[SPEAKER_15]: support of the UFO community or without
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Armchair researchers and hasty-putting
pot-shot plagiarist urologists whose only
[SPEAKER_15]: goal is to make themselves look important
at others' expense, take note.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you who think we're doing a good
job and want to be part of that process,
[SPEAKER_15]: please know that we welcome any support
you feel you can offer, even if we've had
[SPEAKER_15]: personal differences between us in the
past.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those who feel it's all a con game or that
it's all disinformation can continue to
[SPEAKER_15]: throw all the rocks you want.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go right on without you,
just as we always have.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish to state that the text you've just
heard me read is copyrighted.
[SPEAKER_15]: As such, any use of printed video or audio
