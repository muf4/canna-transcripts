[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_00]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mission is to combat the narrative of
the corporate cannabis industry and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: posers are obfuscating for their own
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Matthew here with Thousandfold,
and today we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about...
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeezel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeezel, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite plants, one of my
favorite clones that's been kept over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to give you a... I don't
know how short or long it's going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're going to give you a thorough
rundown of the clone, more about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it came from, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, Thousand, you want to kick
it off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think... I was wondering whether
or not you want to start with the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: who said what, when, versus traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with the back history on just
kind of where it popped up from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jeezel came from the Chem Dog crew
originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the story goes, that it was Chem Dog
Greg, who I believe his first quotes were
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was the Chem Dog D, firming onto
the mass Super Skunk clone, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: different than the VA Super Skunk clone,
different than the mom of Saur,
[SPEAKER_01]: as best we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know what year, I've asked
him several times, but it's inconclusive
[SPEAKER_01]: as of yet, unless he finds his journal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say it's from the VA SS,
is this, do you think that it was just
[SPEAKER_02]: like a Sensei SS?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after talking to Gabby, we've always
had this assumption and knowledge a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit just from different people in the
group saying, yeah, we went and bought
[SPEAKER_01]: more Sensei Seed Super Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether they went there to get it or
ordered it, don't know, but they had more
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensei Seed Super Skunk that they popped
at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after talking to Gabby, he readily
confirmed that there was more Sensei Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Skunk popped all over the place
between all those crews.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure if they did that because
the VA Super Skunk was known as a Super
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk, even though it was probably a
hybrid, according to the guy who made it
[SPEAKER_01]: or accidentally made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: M, I'll call him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know because they knew that
Super Skunk was somewhat in that first one
[SPEAKER_01]: from VA that was really dank that they
decided they were going to start chasing
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Skunks up and down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if they just had smoked other Super
Skunks and said, wow, this is really dank,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're going to go for it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point, they acquired more
Super Skunk Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kim Dog said that he made it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming early 2000s to mid maybe 2004
to 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds more accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think it was around before 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the chem timeline, where is this
relative to the different seed pops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hard question because it all
depends on whose point of view you take
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to the chem seed lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Chem D one of the original seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, is it 91 Super Skunk, which Super
Skunk was the one from Sensei,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the case, according to Greg that
D was in the room at least when Jesus was
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to be later.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we are going by what he says,
and that's my friend, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: call him a liar or anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we believe that's what he says,
then it would have had to have been at
[SPEAKER_01]: least a later pop, whatever was made to
make D.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure it's going to confuse the
shit out of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just go back and listen to our
Chem Dog episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really goes into detail about which one
we think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we'll reference the Codex
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Codex also talks deeply about the Chem
Dog situation and what was what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely check out our Codex and
we'll link you in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that covers it with what was
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another person involved in
Greg's close crew, in Chem Dog Greg's
[SPEAKER_01]: close crew named Bundy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that he was a good friend of
Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was doing a lot of the library
keeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was very into making crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, I would say, probably more of the
strain nerd in the group, trying to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: tabs on that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some other sister lines that
I've been able to get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say not sister, but maybe
tangential sister, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Snow Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snow Dog looks very similar to Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smokes very similar to Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much more resinous, a little bit more
sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would gather it was probably made
around a similar time to the Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both kind of pop up around the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, Bundy probably had
something more to do with it because it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like some of the work that he was
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question here because I don't know
that much about Snow Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it also considered a chem fam quote
unquote?
[SPEAKER_01]: Snow Dog, what was it, Snow Bubble Berry
Chem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Snow Bubble Chem, I think it was called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are these other cuts around
chem fam that I don't, it doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's very clear that it's from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, Snow Dog, Giselle.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are lesser known, obviously chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think also because even though some
of them had dog in the name, Snow Dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: Snow Dog was passed around quite a bit
because it had dog in the name,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Giselle kind of dropped to the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the, there was never any
hype for Giselle over all the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I first got the cut,
there wasn't Giselle hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was chasing Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people never heard of it and didn't
know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting thing to talk about
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know in the past, you've said you
think that's partly because of the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my mind, I'm like, but don't people
like diesel?
[SPEAKER_02]: So wouldn't they have thought,
oh, Giselle is like a diesel thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even just based on the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was also another line called
Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people, when you said Giselle,
we're assuming you were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was also another issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: The UK cheese diesel by someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe that's a Heath Robinson
thing, if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had nothing to do with the Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Greg told it to me, it was Giselle
diesel is where the name came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg's diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as he explained it, it was his favorite
version of the chems and diesels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it was called Giselle
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Manny from the Sour Crew explained
it to me as well, they use the term diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: to describe everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he thought it was more like,
and since he was one of the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: named the chem bag seed, the our chem bag
seed that became diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked him, like, where did you get the
name?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, diesel genes were
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diesel, gas, like, it all kind of came in
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of why the term diesel
popped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus chem weed didn't really flow well
with organic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't like that chem weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they preferred to call it diesel
instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the organic growers can get
real studious about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even the name would bother them.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: So funnily enough, I guess what you're
implying is that if he called it like chem
[SPEAKER_02]: F, it probably would have sold the chem G.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been chased forever,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that, but then chem one is not
really chased, but it was also held back
[SPEAKER_01]: so tight that nobody really got to grow
for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, chem one isn't really chased
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of shoots somewhat of a hole in
my thing, but it's the best I can gather.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not really hoarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diesel clone, like people would pass
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I passed it a lot, but most people would
just drop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we talked about what it's supposed to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about what it is in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to go into any other other
history stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other context that you think
is interesting, I guess, is maybe another
[SPEAKER_02]: way of, you know, we talked about the
name, we talked about the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really, it's been really
interesting, mostly trying to track down
[SPEAKER_01]: the dates, because knowing the dates would
help this make a lot more sense of what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was, what else was in the room that was
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would give us more of a clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if ChemDogD was the pollen
contributor, what else did ChemDogD do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was made?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, things like that would really
help us pin down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own opinions, of course,
on what it is after running it for over 15
[SPEAKER_01]: years and running through a lot of the
S1s, sold a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watched a ton of them grown, too,
by other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own theory on what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just based on knowing a lot about the
D, how it reverses and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it was probably the pure
super skunk herming on itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we know about ChemDogD is that
it doesn't tend to throw live pollen when
[SPEAKER_01]: it hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big problem with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people wanted ChemDS1s over the
years, so they'd torture hermit and it
[SPEAKER_01]: just wouldn't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sterile pollen thrower,
for the most part, unless you use like STS
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, looking at it, the way the plants come
out, it tends to stay true to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk traits, types, terps,
all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, maybe we should just go into the
traits then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, kind of have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the traits of Giesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giesel is a long, lanky plant,
a lot like the diesels, a lot like you
[SPEAKER_01]: would see in OG cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stretches quite a bit in flower,
and even as a veg plant, it does need some
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking because it's very, very lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very lanky plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the heaviest resin producer,
which I think is another reason a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people didn't keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a very old-school look to it,
and I wish we could show pictures of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's how our videos get flagged and
stuff and hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, unfortunately, we can't show the
pictures, but you can go round and
[SPEAKER_01]: reference any of this in the codex under
the Giesel and see some pictures,
[SPEAKER_01]: old, original pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think OG Rascal's pictures are up there,
so shout out to OG Rascal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some of the best original,
some of the first pictures people were
[SPEAKER_01]: putting up online of it that were decent
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, there are only a couple,
but I imagine you have more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, we have more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get more up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got very, very bubbly bracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that a lot of people
notice with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big bubbly bracts, it almost looks
like it's holding monster seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very dense, bubbly bracts,
but the bud density, how the bracts form,
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't super dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not airy, but it's right in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it would be super dense,
but it's just not as dense as it looks,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is another reason people
weren't super chasing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as dense as 91, not as dense as
D, but the main reason that I kept it is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it has this wonderful buttery
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quoting Pip because I could never
place it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always just said skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say it's skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to explain it,
but Pip nailed it down to buttery skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: creamy buttery skunk, savory skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is the most accurate term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say gassy, but it's not
necessarily gassy, but some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: non-harsh tones of gasoline, like at the
punk petrol, that smell minus the harsh
[SPEAKER_01]: notes, they're too loud, is in there,
but with skunk, true to the term skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned the swollen bracts earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you compare the flower structure
in general to a diesel, which also has
[SPEAKER_02]: some of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have that super skunk trait of
the bubbly bracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the traits that runs through
and true through all super skunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right in thinking that the diesel
flowers, they don't seem to end up being
[SPEAKER_02]: quite as big.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem almost, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only seen a few pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, they're delicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grow it, it's delicate,
small buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people blow it up and blow it
out and get large yields from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't like it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt it was always more midsy that way,
and it liked to be a certain look.
[SPEAKER_01]: It liked to be smaller to produce better
resin, and the high was almost always
[SPEAKER_01]: better if you didn't push it too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you push this thing too hard,
she absolutely will herm, just like the
[SPEAKER_01]: old super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the other things,
in my theory, with the Chem D versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mass super skunk was a notorious herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was its reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a great plant, smells great,
fucking herms everywhere, and loads of
[SPEAKER_01]: rumus seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was its reputation ever since I've
been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The likelihood that a Chem Dog D that
throws sterile pollen is in a room with a
[SPEAKER_01]: mass super skunk that's already going to
throw live pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is more likely than the other,
and with how it breeds, I would have to
[SPEAKER_01]: say that it's more likely just super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: To this day, Chem Dog Greg definitely
stands by his story on that it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how he's come to that
conclusion, but I tend to disagree on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there, I wasn't, so it's a really
hard one to disagree on and have any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of standing on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those situations, and we've
run into this a lot with ChemFam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's with all respect, it's just really
how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say about its effects
potency for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, like we always talk about,
effects are very subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the person smoking it,
their brain chemistry, set and setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk about when you're dropping acid
or mushrooms, set and setting is just as
[SPEAKER_01]: important with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a bad mood, have a bad day,
cannabis will not always decrease your
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every strain, not every grove,
every strain will decrease your anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will amplify it, especially for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giselle just doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about how blueberry, I can smoke
it, it has some anti-anxiety effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giselle has the same effect for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have the ass kicking potency of
Chem Dog D that can make you white out or
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like you're dumb speaking,
where when you're speaking and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: you hear coming out of your mouth sounds
stupid and nonsensical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really have that effect for me,
but it does have a lot of the well-being
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super important for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the main reason I smoke is for
anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get amped up too easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I find something like that,
that's very special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I was first given the cut by
Bodhi, he's the first person to pass it to
[SPEAKER_01]: me back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first person I saw actually
growing it and making crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the skunk part that really made
me hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the actual high from it that made
me hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that time, I don't remember a bunch
of people actually actively chasing
[SPEAKER_01]: skunks, skunky smelling stuff when he
passed it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a few years, that became very
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always baffled me that people had
trouble finding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been passed around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: To this day, people still don't get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're starting to a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there are a lot of really
bad faith individuals selling fake clones
[SPEAKER_01]: of it right now on Instagram and wherever
else online.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people's idea of what Giselle is
is very skewed, very, very skewed,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why it's important to talk about
the traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other main traits in all super
skunk that I talk about are the dog-toed
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the small, I don't know
what you call those leaves, sucker leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people call them, but they are
rounded around the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're slightly bent like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it in sour pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it in 91 pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it in all kinds of different
shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just that it has those,
it's the distribution on the bud in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern that specifically leaves the look
of super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the quickest identifiers for
super skunk stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rarely, rarely have ever seen pictures
of another plant that has that trait,
[SPEAKER_01]: that specific trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen it on, I want to say it was
early girl clone from a High Times
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine, but as we know, High Times use
stock pictures and would call them certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being as that's the only one anomalous
picture I've ever seen, I tend to think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was probably a super skunk hybrid just
being pushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magazine is that, that one picture,
but I can't say for sure, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Historically, Matt, maybe now is a good
time to talk about what kind of crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: did you make with it and what else have
you seen other people make with it that
[SPEAKER_02]: you feel has stood up or has been
interesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the first crosses I saw with it
were Bodie's, I think it was called Isaac
[SPEAKER_01]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Yo Sammy has released a line called
Isaac Hayes, but I don't know which one
[SPEAKER_01]: came first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's two different continents.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been simultaneous for all we
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Isaac Hayes released by Bodie was a
Giesel cross to Aseed's Benge Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a Miao Tai Hayes of some old
timers Hayes, maybe Benge Hayes was,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that was the first cross I'd ever seen
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a lot of super skunk types in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody that grew it absolutely
loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what made me ask him
for the clone in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seeing him make that cross,
seeing pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was absolutely gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got ahold of it, one of the other
things I was chasing at the time was a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone called Superdog.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I'd ever seen pictures of
Giesel wasn't the rascal pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually in the Canna Bible from
Jason King.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with, the Giesel, there was also
Snow Dog in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Superdog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Superdog was supposedly a Chem 91 mass
super skunk, which sounds very similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: me to Chem Doggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd assume it would be something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my first goals with the Giesel,
since it was very similar, was to recreate
[SPEAKER_01]: something like the Superdog because it
wasn't available anywhere in my city or
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone I knew had the Superdog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud would come down of the Maui Superdog
to San Diego, but that was rarely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I want to recreate this
with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the closest it gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first seed line with it,
I believe, was the Superdog 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first real release with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really stoked with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Skunk Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that I did was the Giesel
cross to Shug Knight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, it was Giesel West Coast Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is not related to Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a scam cut line from Paradise Seeds
Mod, TK1.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had a million names.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a Bubba type, but a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a really nice plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the West Coast Dog cross to the
Shug Knight OGBX1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, again, the Shug Knight's been
really popular to talk about on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other day I saw someone telling a
story that the Shug Knight was some clone
[SPEAKER_01]: that the rapper went to Nepal to go get to
bring back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became OG, which is totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shug Knight was a forum member.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was making like Northern Lights Leopard
Kush, things like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Shug Knight Kush was a Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shug Knight OG was probably the OG
Bubba OG type back cross of some sort,
[SPEAKER_01]: if he even went that far with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know Shug to know how much work
he was actually doing or not doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of what else I've made
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, of course, have the blooper skunk,
the Giselle cross to the blue bonnet,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is by far my favorite Giselle clone
up until current time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very, very skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They merge really well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very true to keeping that beautiful,
beautiful Giselle super skunk look,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with a lot more resin too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's probably one of my
favorite lines to smoke with the Giselle
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of what else I made
with Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to whack it with everything every
year that I had it, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other one I can think of is
the triangle choke, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The triangle choke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was during one of our Giselle
reversals back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was also Sour Dub Giselle that
my buddy RacerX made and released with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorites of all time
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Skunk Scrakem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to do with the theory that super
skunk, that skunk smell is a double
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you cross two double recessives,
which would be two super skunk types
[SPEAKER_01]: displaying that type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a sour to a Giselle, it will
almost always just constantly throw that
[SPEAKER_01]: smell and, and, and skunkiness and gas and
it locks that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's one of my favorite
process for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can see why, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's if you've got your blue locked in and
you've got the Giselle, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: super skunk locked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had the triangle choke Giselle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something I released with Chem
Dog Greg as a collab, but didn't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle Kush was kind of popular at the
time, but not as well known maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like trying to, trying to hit a height
that wasn't there at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I popped them myself and I found a
keeper and that's what we hit with the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue bonnet and I was already doing some
sour diesel blue bonnet, Giselle blue
[SPEAKER_01]: bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were all sorts of different super
skunks in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Motorbreath 15 blue bonnet, the Chem
Sister S1 blue bonnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to throw in another one just
to kind of see how that distribution works
[SPEAKER_01]: in crossing it to super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably like one of the most
beautiful frosty, crazy potent lines that
[SPEAKER_01]: came out of the blue bonnet crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody pretty much
universally likes it and finds something
[SPEAKER_01]: that they find to be a keeper somewhere in
that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bunch of pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely been popular recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, on our Discord there's tons of
pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scruton and Blue Groose have gotten
beautiful pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite looking cuts of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Chalice as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we at?
Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did mention S1s, but I was kind of
curious what else you might've seen when
[SPEAKER_02]: you did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the S1s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in the S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the S1s, there is some heavy
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think there would be as much
variation as there was, because if it is
[SPEAKER_01]: an S2, I would expect it to breed more
true to type.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in saying that, there was like mango
versions of it popping out, sweet versions
[SPEAKER_01]: popping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tended to keep the same structure and
look for the most part, but some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: did have more of a more conical skunk 1
type bud structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely showed more of the
recessive skunk 1 in the S2s, while also
[SPEAKER_01]: in the S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a mass super skunk S2,
it's still showing the variation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk 1 inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it stuck mostly to the
savory skunk, the buttery skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was also some mango types,
but that's mostly the range it stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in skunk 1 hybrids, I tend to see a
lot of that sweet, generic, let me say
[SPEAKER_01]: mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really mango-mango, but it's like
a sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's generic sweet fruit tropical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did talk already about what you
thought it is, obviously, so I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if we... I mean, yeah, I still think it's
a super skunk S2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite everything that was said about it
in history, I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be wrong, but there's always going
to be some doubt there because I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but I do think it is a pure super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's probably not a bad time to
actually just go into the drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so CSI Humboldt first got the diesel
cut in 2006 and ran it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd spoken about it over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He dropped it after, and he was like,
yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember running it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't really like diesels in the
first place, so it was a hard sell to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the homie to run diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, you like skunky stuff?
Stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a few years ago, and he hit
me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, dude, just diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that felt really good because I like
when I tell someone something that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: is really special and someone as
experienced as him agrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he sees more stuff than probably
anyone else I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like more different variations of
everything by doing massive seed pops,
[SPEAKER_01]: making tons of hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he interested him enough to work with
it, and we decided we're going to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: collab on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to make some more S1s since
I was all out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know of any with great
provenance out there that exist other than
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was time to bang some out,
and we decided to make some hybrids as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spent some months talking about what
would be good pairings for the diesel
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think, should I go through the
list of what was hit or what's available?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably what's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably what's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can go into what was hit just
to generate more hype later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe for now, just start with what's
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we had the Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the reasoning behind that was
one of CSI's favorite plants was the Sour
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite plants was the Sour
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to be very close,
but I like diesel more than diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sour, so I thought that this would be
a good direction for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to do the Chem-D diesel just
to have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my theory, if Chem-D's in this plant,
it'll either look like a Chem-D,
[SPEAKER_01]: a feminized Chem-D BX, or it'll look like
the first Chem-D super scum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And will we be able to tell just by
running a large population?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but it was something that we
both liked the idea of and wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we tell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any way to define this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why that was thrown in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogshit is one of the Dogshit and Electric
Boogaloo, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its original name was Electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for all intents and purposes,
we're calling it Dogshit because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's colloquial known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows it is Dogshit,
so that's what we're going with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogshit's one of the most famous clones
that pretty much everyone universally
[SPEAKER_01]: loves when they try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that had to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some sort of probably NL5Hase type,
maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know enough about it,
but it's history or it's a hard plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: nail down as far as turps on what it could
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seemed like a good pairing for the
Gisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you go in, do you have any sense of
what to expect from that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a wild card, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a wild card.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more of a question for CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have as much experience with
Dogshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only done one cross with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't run it a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of an older clone that took a
long time to get to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, sorry, while we're on this
note, what do you hope for from the Bubba
[SPEAKER_02]: Gisle?
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of mentioned the, what was the
comparison you had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour Bubba?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour Bubba, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Bubba in itself is already like,
when you grow it certain ways and nail it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see expressions of OG Kush in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see some of the Bubba expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of stuff in Bubba Gisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it's nailed, it can be super
turpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because Gisle is also super,
super turpy itself, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Sour Bubba that we've smoked before
are just stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely stellar highs, stellar turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I like Gisle more than Sour,
and I think it's more turpy and less
[SPEAKER_01]: noxious offensive, I think it'll be pretty
insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the reasons we went with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the same reason we went with
Irene Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Large, large turp percents coming out of
it, very turpy, seems to merge well with
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Gisle, in the S1s, you can find OG
Kush smelling-ish plants, not identical,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to see if we can push Irene
more in that direction and find a more
[SPEAKER_01]: turpy, skunky version of OG Kush by doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, that's why I wanted to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can only speak for myself on that,
and it made it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pineapple Gisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know anything about pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a humble NorCal type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that Inspector wanted to
use, CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a large-gilding outdoor plant that
smells pineapple-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have no clue how that's going to
combine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love pineapple turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The C99 pineapple is like a turpentine
pineapple type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is, I don't think
it's a turpentine pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if it's the pineapple tie
from Shaw, if it's the same cut or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to find out more about that one,
but it is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, of course, did the Sour Gisle,
the Super Skunk Recessive Double Up that I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy, easy money right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bam, easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's going to come out dank as
hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every time you mix two Super Skunk
types, it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted something readily available
for people to find keepers in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in very small amounts of z-pods if you
don't have room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone wants Super Skunk, that's going
to be their ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Sour Gisle S1s have been very
hard to make, very hard to come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really close to what you would
expect from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you one thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it's not on the list and I
don't know if it was even, did you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: not do an Urkel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Urkel was ready at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the room and the reason it wasn't in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that had to do with what do we
have available?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in cuts?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's rooted?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we want to throw in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course it was his first time
reversing Gisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like he wasn't sure if it was going to
always, if it was going to be a successful
[SPEAKER_01]: reversal too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we know that he's capable of
reversing it, nailing it really easy like
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, it probably going to be the next
round or a future round.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's kind of one that needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel makes beautiful hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I do see that he, I mean,
again, I don't know if this one is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual ones that's released yet,
but there's a T1000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, I remember talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you bring that up and that was
going to be our closest to Urkel because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, ah, T1000 is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well, you know, run with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the last one on the list is
the 5150, which is his select cut of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle Kush S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big yolder, super potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super chirpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, along the ideas of the Irene,
we wanted a lot, but this is more like a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger yielding commercial Giesel that
anybody who loves OG Kush loves Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: will love this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was our idea behind that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we just dropped these Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, we decided to drop them
and tonight I'm going to be packing and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all kinds of shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to make it really clear, they're
available on your website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they're available on riotseats.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also available on HumboldtCSI.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either place is great to grab them
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the freebies that are going to be with
it are the Sour Diesel Giesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can buy it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are available to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be sending out Sour Diesel
Giesel with these first orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for outdoor people, I would probably
recommend the Pineapple Giesel because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a proven outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dogshit Giesel, another proven outdoor
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irene does pretty well outdoors as long as
it's not too humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba don't have humid outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, KMD does really well outdoors too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those are going to be good
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giesel does well outdoors too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giesel does great outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mold too readily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fast flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're talking eight weeks
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not pushing it any longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She will herm if you push her longer than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the gift that keeps on giving from
the mass super stunk is the intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get to this point in growing,
you learn to watch your plants take care
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're easily remedied.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not anything I take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she does breed more consistently
non-intersex than the actual plant is when
[SPEAKER_01]: you push her hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to prod you about one more of
the crosses that Caleb mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: but again, probably not in the release.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cookies times Giesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is going to come out of
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it'd probably be along the Urkel
type and OG type.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably see a little segregation
above populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's also the F1 Derb was in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or no, no, Flowrider.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Flowrider OG in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the LA Kush in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the 56-day headband in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_01]: His Pure OG, which is the first cut of OG
Kush that he ever got from Elk Slayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually have one of his older OG
cuts in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the snow, different kind of hash
plants, sweet kind of hash plants across
[SPEAKER_01]: it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 1 is also in there, which is more of
a NL5 haze type of chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are definitely coming too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they'll eventually be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them we didn't get a ton of seeds
from, so they may not be released,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're just going to run them to look
and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some, yeah, eventually will be
released, like the bubblegum Giesel and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've covered most of,
I think, of the information that we wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anything you wanted to say about
the codex?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to add more stuff to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really wanted to get to it over
Christmas, but some people know I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with some health stuff,
and I've been figuring it out kind of what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is, and it kept hitting a little bit
during Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't get to do as much as I wanted
to with adding to the codex, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a nonstop project.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to hear some more in detail
about what we were talking about with the
[SPEAKER_01]: different versions of the chem stories,
what we think versus what's been
[SPEAKER_01]: established, the codex is a great place to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Codex.thebreedersyndicate.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is this to be the best resource
for historical clouds and historical
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go look at it, and it's not
going to be just my take on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be several different takes
on each thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mark it as speculative.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's speculative, we mark it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's for sure and there's no argument
about what it is, that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like we tried to think of all
the variables that we could to cover all
[SPEAKER_01]: the bases so people understand the
information that they're reading and how
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable it is, isn't, or could possibly
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, between both of us,
we've put a lot of time and energy into
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and I'm really stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be one of the most
important things that we do as the
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndicate together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope everyone else is stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that this episode is also,
I think, the first episode for the new
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Happy New Year, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy New Year!
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I was kind of doing like a recap
of 2023 with my girlfriend last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually kind of blows my mind that
the Codex was just earlier last year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, last year went really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the big things that
happened last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how much the show has changed and
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the last year, I took it back,
started producing it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like all the that happened
within a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just went crazy in a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where it's at versus where it's at now
versus where it's at before, I really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really am proud of how far it's come.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've doubled the number of
subscribers in the last six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am pissed that my gamble of hitting
10,000 didn't happen, but it's still the
[SPEAKER_01]: first week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's January, so we're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody like and subscribe because I
want to hit the 10K mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told that I would hit it by January.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beginning of January, too, with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's not make a liar of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's mostly it to cover for
Gizel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have any questions or comments
or concerns, if any of the chem fam want
[SPEAKER_01]: to chime in, the comments are below.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't delete comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I don't care if they're
they're counterintuitive to what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: saying or disagree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good place to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have meaningful, open
conversations and transparent
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do sometimes delete comments if they're
just straight, toxic and non-constructive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people are being like mental and
using it like their diary to shitpost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll delete those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, like if it's if it's
topic relevant, it stays.
And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave your comments, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one shout out before I hand it over
to you, Matt, to wrap up, which is Kana
[SPEAKER_02]: Kibana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kana Kibana is open and Kirby wants you to
get a hold of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's ready to book the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be doing an episode with
the Kana Kibana crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure we're going to talk about yet
exactly, but it's going to be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm stoked on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who don't know, the Kana Kibana
is the longest running forum still active.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally built as a refuge for
Overgrow members after Overgrow got popped
[SPEAKER_01]: and shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heaven Stairway got popped and shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a private refuge and it was kept
private, mostly secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like still a lot of a lot of people that
are on the forums had never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weren't invited there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to be invited by someone and
vouched for to even get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of January 1st, it's open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kana Kibana dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and CSI are going to be really active
there as much as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who run it, Optimus Prime,
D-Man, Skitty and Curbside, they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: legends in their own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all legends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be an honor to have them on and
to be able to discuss something that was
[SPEAKER_01]: so secret and private for so long out in
the open is a real treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go sign up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great conversations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of old data, pictures, strain infos.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The free-for-all FFA is on there,
which is an old mass super scunt cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't know about pictures of
that on there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was called free-for-all because
everybody would pass it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was free-for-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it got locked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to add as well that it might
seem odd to talk about forums in 2023,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at the same time, they are so superior
when it comes to information than over
[SPEAKER_02]: social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just no comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the ways in which people can
actually discuss things you just don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: in like an Instagram post.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, we have our discord
that we talked about our Patreon discord
[SPEAKER_01]: where we do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing I want to say is a lot
of people that weren't around for the
[SPEAKER_01]: forum era and weren't a part of the forum
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your way to understand that kind
of culture that we talk about a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: like how we interact with each other,
how we build relationships and share
[SPEAKER_01]: clones as opposed to like always trading
or, you know, selling clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of you guys hear me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like selling clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like when people have to go buy
them because I know how many people are
[SPEAKER_01]: out there scamming right now versus even
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that stuff was given in past as
merit to show, I trust you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we're going to show our trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of culture is still alive
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to want to learn about it,
you want to experience it, it's very alive
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't give a stronger wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a place that with that, I mean,
do you have anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was that was it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am smashed it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, we have our Breeders
Syndicate Patreon that I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to patreon.com for slash Breeders
Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's five dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically that keeps most of the
trolls out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they make it in, we still boot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're being more aggressive about making
sure that it's a fun environment and not
[SPEAKER_01]: and not depressing because, you know,
sometimes some people can can take it
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to to keep that that vibe
really, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a part of that is by keeping out
trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a dollar amount with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we try to make it affordable,
like less than a Starbucks coffee now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we watch fights together
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have our our tier where you can,
you know, get packages every three months
[SPEAKER_01]: or so and it comes loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different breeders, you know, a lot of
it's unreleased stuff or soon to be
[SPEAKER_01]: released stuff that you get a first crack
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the top tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our our codex, obviously,
that we talked about codex dot the
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeders Syndicate dot com to treasure
trove of information that we are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly be adding to until the day I
stop breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a thousand is I'm proud of his
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: On it and all the time that he put into
making that beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I forgetting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm forgetting something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's the banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have Gert by Seeds in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Wright Seiko Europe for our
European fellows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have lifted seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great guy out of the NorCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get our stuff from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people from the syndicate stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, of course, right seeds dot com
where you can get my reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the diesel S ones and hybrids
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's all kinds of other stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're part of the patron,
you can save some money up to 30 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: just for spending five dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big, big savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people use that all the time and it
works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everyone to have a happy and safe
New Year and be good to each other unless
[SPEAKER_01]: unless people are scumbags and don't be
good to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, we'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to sit at the table with the
syndicate?

goodies to sort you out and shipping is

notch.

this purpose.

[SPEAKER_01]: We also have an underground syndicate
discord where we get together and solve
[SPEAKER_01]: old strain history together daily.

from IG and it's an amazing resource for
[SPEAKER_01]: old catalogs and knowledge.

growers.
