[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Breeders Syndicate,
the only cannabis show breaking down the
[SPEAKER_00]: myths and history in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew, seed maker for over a decade
and a half, and this is my journey into
[SPEAKER_00]: finding my truth in this wild world of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to join me and the Canna
Luminati by strapping into the passenger
[SPEAKER_00]: seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be warned, it's not always pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the invasion of corporate culture
into cannabis, it's getting even more
[SPEAKER_00]: muddy, which is why I've made it my
mission to have a permanent record before
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the history is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And buried under a pile of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The syndicate is a collection of seed
makers that want to push back against all
[SPEAKER_00]: the smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In doing so, we will continue to ruffle
the feathers of those who oppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my personal mission has become much
bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the cannabis underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the plan is today is to get a review
down on the three different punchy
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to smell and smoke some of
this fine punchy offrengue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like try to get a review down of the
different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of cool because these ones
have cured all a little differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's cool about these punchy is that
they have like most berry stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: like most blueberry stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be really strong in the plant,
but once it's, once you go to chop,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can go earthy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of stuff can, especially the
blueberry stuff can cure extremely berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cure extremely chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cure extremely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like blueberry candy, blueberry
cream, blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's like raspberry chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, like in scent anyways,
but I want to see how it passes to taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things I noticed the
other day was that one that smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: completely berries tasted completely black
licorice, which is something new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a black licorice tasting
strong bonnet expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is punchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's why, like it was modified
so hard, but it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with, let me see if
this is hot enough first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if my anal lawn is hot enough
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use the rip for this
because obviously that makes for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate of flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll start with number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe number two was the keeper that
he ended up, my buddy who grew this ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up keeping, but yeah, I'll see if it's my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes the high the best from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes the potency the best from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he liked the turps the best
from it, but he still wants to pop more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he wants to find one that he's
specifically looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, like, like with me, like the
number three to me so far has been one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorites, my personal favorites,
but a lot of stuff is down to preference,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we smell things, how we taste things
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always cool to get different
perspectives on the same bud from people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the punchy bluster number
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't know, punchy bluster
is a punch banana OG on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is hot enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I'm going down on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there is a soft berry in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a soft berry in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see why you kept this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to load up another bowl here
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how good is a blue sour seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's all perspective,
but I know that, uh, I know that people
[SPEAKER_00]: love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if you love sour, there's
everything from pure blueberry jam to full
[SPEAKER_00]: on burnt rubber sour in everywhere in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, I'm simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was blue three.
[SPEAKER_00]: No wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that I tended to like the
most so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see what this one, this is the
blue two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, that's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: No wonder why it's the one that I like
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's just strong, strong,
deep blueberry scent, which I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, even after a few weeks of
curing, they're just killing it right now
[SPEAKER_00]: on the, the blue turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how this one, uh, differs in flavor
since the scent is very similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very similar to the, uh,
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to wait a second while it warms up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and the other thing with the rip I
noticed is you got to suck it slowly like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's your dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or I don't know, it just, it's
pointless to try to suck it super hard
[SPEAKER_00]: because this, the air goes down so slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how I felt it worked best though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the one that has a full on
black licorice taste to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: His keeper is the one that has the fucking
black licorice taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the number eight, just raspberry
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you get those, uh, chocolate,
raspberry filled chocolates from the
[SPEAKER_00]: store, that smell and taste it's what this
smells like is raspberry chocolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, um, I've seen blueberry chocolate
and stuff cure, but I've never had this
[SPEAKER_00]: hard raspberry tone with the chocolate in
the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole lot to love about,
um, DJ's blueberry line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I mean, like he gets cracked
on for how it was made, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing sisters that were narrow leaf to
broad leaf repeatedly and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely an artistic take on
breeding, not a scientific take,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, by any stretch, but what it did allow
for was a lot of really beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions to come through things like
raspberry chocolate and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's special, but I don't know
what this one tastes like under this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it has any of the, uh, raspberry
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So totally Berry on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't taste a lot of the
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just tastes like blueberry,
but the scent is all raspberry chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lovely taste though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be one of my favorite tastes out
of all three, as far as the berry goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what I'm getting from all these a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I put, he did a killer job on the
grow, which of course is to me is
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, ah, without shitty
genetics, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without a good grower, what good are
the genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super berry, super, super berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to show you not everything tastes
like it smells, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should want to edit it and post on
YouTube's review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people love to hear you review
some of your own lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said yesterday job, like with the
reviews on the YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, um, man, it's hard to, it's hard to
review my own shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just don't want people to think,
uh, this is so self-serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives a fuck what that stuff's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear about other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is always that,
um, divide there and I try to keep that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in consideration, but at the same
time, like, yeah, I'll probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to take that advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well put it up and edit it and
put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real quickly, I wanted to apologize for
the audio and the review, uh, of the
[SPEAKER_00]: punchy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it on Instagram live and it was done
with the, uh, iPhone mic and is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apologies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I also wanted to end the review by
thanking the person who sent this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he likes to remain nameless in our
crew, but he's one of our crew members and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's just a really, really talented,
sweet, sweet dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, his grows are exceptional,
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I have really, really thoroughly
enjoyed, um, waking up the past month and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to smoke a bunch of blueberry
because some of my, uh, some of my boys
[SPEAKER_00]: are pushing it really hard on my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So props to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I'm really, really proud of
these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some cool stuff coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, definitely go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's eats.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear the advertisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to shout out to my boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer job doing great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: More I can say about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm, I'm really happy with how these
turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if you dig blue, um, it's a great
place to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of grapes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but a lot of this stuff is cured up
more blue than anything to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also like impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of my other buddies got one and
he thinks it smells more purple punchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent a lot of time in the blue zone
so I can get those fine nuances out and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, maybe I tune out some of that
stuff, but yeah, I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole thing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple people doing news reviews,
multiple perspectives on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's most important because
we don't all smell or taste the same with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
