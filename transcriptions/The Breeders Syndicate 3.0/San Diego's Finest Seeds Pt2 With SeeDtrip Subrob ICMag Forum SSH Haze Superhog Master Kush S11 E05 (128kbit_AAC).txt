[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate 3.0,
the next evolution of the look into
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture that is Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Matthew, owner of Riot Seeds,
and this started as a one-man mission for
[SPEAKER_00]: strain history and breeding science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it's evolved into something
bigger, better, and more of a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be joined by members of the Kana
Luminati and other friends throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons to hear their takes on grow
techniques, breeding science, strain
[SPEAKER_00]: history, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mission is to combat the narrative
that corporate cannabis and seed posers
[SPEAKER_00]: are obfuscating for their own financial
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Reader Syndicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew here today with Seed Trip Rob,
aka Sub Rob, as I knew him when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: started talking to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover some stuff that we
didn't cover last time, maybe expand on a
[SPEAKER_00]: few things that we kind of felt like we
should go more in depth on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to start it off
today talking about San Diego's finest
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we briefly mentioned how
influential it was at the time and still
[SPEAKER_00]: is today, but that was more from the
purview of my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the scene as a whole, that thing
took on a life of its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with what year did that
kind of start forming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why was there three, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would be easy to look up,
but I want to say around 2008,
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of years after I signed up on the
mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 2009, it had to be 2008,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was formed to showcase and inform
on the cuts that G was bringing into,
[SPEAKER_02]: that Ape was bringing into San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much the rest of California
running back and forth, north and south.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was started by Dragoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the San Diego cats saw the
title and signed right up for her buddy of
[SPEAKER_02]: theirs and signed up on IC mag just to
keep an eye on the thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like I said, we had a running list
of what G was bending at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a bad ass thread right from the
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it evolved from there into general all
around everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the theme was mostly cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were running in San Diego and we were
all on that trip, you know, free the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people were always bringing
new stuff in and it just became inevitable
[SPEAKER_02]: that people would start spreading the
genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't hurt G's business at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually sold clones fairly affordably
even back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you weren't having the $500 cut for
this and $800 for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Raiders won.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the draft go, by the way?
[SPEAKER_02]: It went well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unexpected, but the Raiders won.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Raiders got a lot of the depth they
needed to be able to compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be, it's going to be a
fun season.
[SPEAKER_02]: If nothing else, AP is the coach.
Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Max, get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we got, well, I won't go into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I can talk as much about as
cannabis, it's the Raiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like me with the MMA and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can talk about just about
anything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything where men get a hold of each
other and hold each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, again, I want to, I want to
stress that like, you know, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: AP gets brought up a lot, but he was such
a major influence on even shit that I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that you did, how the scene blew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire state, you know, even the big
guys up north in the triangle,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had access to all kinds of stuff that
other people didn't, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: but sometimes they wanted something that
they saw and it would get it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot, there was a lot of
difference between what was going on up
[SPEAKER_00]: there versus down in SoCal, despite,
you know, like some of the stuff that was
[SPEAKER_00]: sold at Harborside would come down here,
but there was still quite a big divide
[SPEAKER_00]: between what we were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't seeing a lot of like bull
rider and hogs of breath way up north
[SPEAKER_00]: being blown up in mass, you know,
it was quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was, it was big, but they
didn't, it's not part of the family tree
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the bay, like everybody knows
the bay was, was purple crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can start with one of those
granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you first see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did it hit the scene down there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I might've gotten that from,
from a, um, I don't remember maybe Sean or
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the other guys might remember,
but it wasn't the, it wasn't one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: two main GDP cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, son of bog later known as great punch,
uh, let me hold it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought that the cat that I had,
cause it was small, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grew like freaking bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grew bubble with slightly smaller nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about that kind of bubble,
the one that just, uh, it took forever to
[SPEAKER_02]: get there, uh, was not a yielder,
but, uh, I guess it resembled a cat that
[SPEAKER_02]: was known to some people as the Royal and
that information came from, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado, wherever, wherever great punch
was based.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first I'd ever heard of the
Royal cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never heard of it, but yeah,
it was different though.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing pictures of like Ken's
GDP being all like perped out and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like like magenta purple and the one down
in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't look anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do remember the slow growth a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a more cushy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more, more poke than the other two
GDPs that I grew in San Diego,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I was not, I was not necessarily
that big a fan of GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purples I usually like are those old
school purple steaky incense, Afghani,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always took you for a fruity guy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That surprises me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's how I come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the grape vape compare that went
around San Diego to the GDP?
[SPEAKER_02]: The kind of grape vape I had, uh,
sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember specifically being very
disappointed in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, while mislabeled cuts weren't
as common back then as they are just
[SPEAKER_02]: because sheer volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say for sure that that was the
grape vape that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that made big book of buds or the Kiana
Bible or whichever one it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those purple strains that
doesn't turn all the way purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got like purple streaks through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a very odd look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how disappointed I wasn't that I
remember these details.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus I've been strumming through the
forums, uh, refreshing and I saw a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of takes of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what wasn't purple almost looked like,
uh, it had a goldish tint to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you pull out some six or eight
month cured buds and they had a gold mug
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, not to the point of you know,
falling apart yet where you like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it just, uh, it wasn't,
it wasn't something that I ever grew a
[SPEAKER_02]: second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: The SR 71 that went around San Diego was
definitely runs on the ladder above grape
[SPEAKER_02]: vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember going, huge fan of that either,
but it was, I remember growing Urkel at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time as the SR 71.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could never tell them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I would, I would be like,
well, this one's a little more hashy
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling or tasting as opposed to full
grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like the only difference I
noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: SR 71 grew a little bit faster,
but not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember them looking almost identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, well, I hesitate, I'm a little
more hesitant now to say I never grew
[SPEAKER_02]: so-and-so because as I've gone back to the
forums to Kanda, get ideas for what we
[SPEAKER_02]: should talk about, I'm finding a whole lot
of stuff that I completely forgot I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't believe I ever grew Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do remember smoking, uh, smoking it for
a while because one of the things we did
[SPEAKER_02]: on the thread was after we had met,
you know, each other and got everybody to
[SPEAKER_02]: know each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: If one person, you know, was going to
grow, a couple of pounds of one thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: then everybody else would focus on
something else and just get samples from
[SPEAKER_02]: the other growers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, getting purple Urkel from Sean,
maybe Grotec.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he grew that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I, for a grapey, for a grapey,
uh, purple cat, that was, that was pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one always fucked me up and made me,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never liked the high from it,
but it always smelled really good and
[SPEAKER_00]: tasted really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd always smoke it and ended up
regretting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it would spin me out like in a real
weird direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I don't remember how much we
went into bull rider other than the,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, just little bits of the story where
the dude from, um, I want to say Fresno is
[SPEAKER_00]: where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came down with old Betsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, uh, trying to figure
out much about the story of bull rider
[SPEAKER_00]: was, was a little hard, but there was the
Afghani bull rider that was big down in
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, can you touch on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have bull rider, which is huge
and Jerbo from Dago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Herbo recently, I saw on Instagram,
maybe it was an Instagram story or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a post and it's still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he posted a small short, uh,
summation of where it came from to the
[SPEAKER_02]: best of his knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that the guy was a bull
rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the Afghani bull rider that
was going around, uh, it was popular to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would assume because maybe, maybe it was
a yielder space saver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uh, maybe the Afghani shortened
it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never as big a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the weed that no matter where you
were drinking at in North County,
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody at the bar, the side of the bar
always had a little bit of Afghani bull
[SPEAKER_02]: rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, it was grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was grown by a lot of people who
probably all the people who wanted to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: bull rider couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, was that via Jeff tech first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that Jeff tech was in that original
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or ancillary to it, you know, one degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know if he's the one who found
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that he grabbed it from somebody
else who was in the, in the crew and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good guy to ask about the history of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, there was another seed that got
popped by Brandon Russ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's made of Afghani bull rider in
the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made its way out to, uh, a couple of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, among them, Sean has been
posted recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it looks better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean says it's better hands down and he's
still running it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's whether or not it's good smoke,
but you'd have to go there for details.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should have hit him up about that
before I came on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met that kid, I want to say four years
ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed up in my, when I used to do
Instagram live streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rust kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he first, he came on claiming that
he bred bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was like, well, yeah,
which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghani bull rider bull riders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, there's, there's not just one,
you know, like he didn't even know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there, there was something even called
Afghani bull rider at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but later he then took credit for breeding
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always been sus as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime his name comes up, I'm like,
I fucking clown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have to, I actually, I actually,
well, I never met the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I heard when, when I started
following them or I would know how I can,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe Sean pointed a mouse, probably some
any bull rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that, uh, sometimes you get into
arguments about stuff that, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it, is from the past like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he seems like he knows what the fuck
he's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: He seems like a hard worker, uh,
hard hustler for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hustles the fuck out of people and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no, no love for that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind talking shit on people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, and the only reason I know who
Jeff tech was cause I wasn't involved with
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, with those original
transplant in 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I know of Jeff tech because when,
when bull rider in Canada launched,
[SPEAKER_02]: they pretty much, they were about night
hit up Sean, the local, one of the local
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego historians.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and that's when I found out who
Jeff tech was and how he was connected up
[SPEAKER_02]: north.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ended up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Music producer, somehow they were in the
same circle and map getting bull rider
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still, still have cut, still growing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and somehow turned it into a bull
rider brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I'm angry about now,
because I reached out to Ovo and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, our, well, first thing I did was
reached out to everybody I knew in San
[SPEAKER_02]: Diego and we hit a bull rider Instagram
pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, do you even know what you're just
ripping off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, to his credit, Ovo did reach out a few
times and just, they never actually
[SPEAKER_02]: connected with Jerbo and him to discuss
the history of the bull rider brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you look at the brand,
it's the same brand that Jerbo designed
[SPEAKER_02]: originally for his clothing and
accessories.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ovo did reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's on, it's on Jerbo to
reach back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerbo is hard to get ahold of though,
sometimes so I could see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerbo has been hard to get ahold of
sometimes though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could see that being a task.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to him a number of times and
he's just one of those strange cats,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he doesn't, he doesn't really
seem that concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not, you know, on online here
blasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bull rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: If nobody's upset then, Hey man,
just, you know, show a little something
[SPEAKER_02]: about the history of bull rider and that
it's not a, where are they at Toronto?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a Toronto, you know, culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a San Diego thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just acknowledge it and, uh, fucking run
with it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as long as they don't touch P 91,
I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you first see the crack?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you saw it, was it called green
Kush with the C or was it called green
[SPEAKER_00]: crack first?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was, it was both when I saw
it first, I can't remember where I saw it
[SPEAKER_02]: first, but I do remember smoking it and
saying, wow, I would have, and this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: as insulting or as negative as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, I would have loved this
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first blueberry was the first strain I
ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a tone specific could be
described as camp.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but green crack just had that overall
sweetness that, uh, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, and I was already online and
that was when that's when people would
[SPEAKER_02]: have the debates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was the, the cannabis
grammar guys who, who insisted on calling
[SPEAKER_02]: it this or that and not me because they
had negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be versus green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that never, that never bothered me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never bothered me either, but I saw a
lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do understand some of that,
that old school, you know, speak about it
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm with that train of thought
and where that, that whole small movement
[SPEAKER_02]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you were speaking to
somebody, educating them about cannabis or
[SPEAKER_02]: forming them about sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been sure call it cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're on a fucking weed
forum, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, so, uh, that came around,
uh, which you had asked if we'd covered
[SPEAKER_02]: green ice and, uh, green was a Cali green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he crossed green ice to gorilla,
uh, gorilla gold from breeder Brad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm the last cast of gorilla gold
number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was going through the forums,
I found out it was gorilla gold number
[SPEAKER_02]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but that just made an almost perfect
sweet cannabis strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think any of us gave it
the credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we had it, well, as far as I know,
Cali was the only one who ever grew up
[SPEAKER_02]: because again, we were in that rush of
strains for the first time ever where you
[SPEAKER_02]: could have 20 different cuts delivered to
your house and smoke a joint with the
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I didn't high and lonesome
who's working with green crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: High and lonesome with the, uh,
Appalachia for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was putting out S ones when I was down
in San Diego and that pissed a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people off because everybody thought I was
going to take their clones and S one it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, everybody was worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's still worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, CSI gave me great advice a long
time ago and he said, don't ever tie
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to one clone because if you do,
someone's going to get it and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be real sad about it and you're
not going to have anything left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never worry about tying yourself to one
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always kind of gone with that,
but, um, yeah, I remember back then
[SPEAKER_00]: getting locked out of everything because,
because I was a dude making fem seeds down
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, and S ones of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had appreciated the, the,
the value of S one seeds, uh, before I
[SPEAKER_02]: did, because I passed a lot of S one
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking them in, uh, for a while I was
afraid of, you know, like a lot of old
[SPEAKER_02]: schoolers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I finally started messing
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to S one every cut that I enjoyed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro science damned everything,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it just leaves it all for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is that, is it just alien dog as a dub
or do we know what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alien dog crossed with sourdough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we know if that was, um,
alien dog from OBSOL or from Swindle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The eight does not plot the flavor that
you expect from, or not that you expect,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that you hope from sourdough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't matter because that high to
my physiology is so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a dub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that still around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to cop that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever grown a dub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in, in the era of turps,
you know, I don't think it'll ever be a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the era of smoking flower and
getting high, like concentrate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying strength to strength,
but that type of high that encompasses,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, again, I was never the best at
descriptions, but everybody who smoked Ato
[SPEAKER_02]: will tell you essentially the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very unique high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a reason they've kept it
around this long, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last time I called it,
it's like being high in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until you finally get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there was one, when I was going
through the strain list, purple joy,
[SPEAKER_00]: did that come via eight?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was something that, uh,
Spicoli, Sean Crump, uh, source.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, but he did give it to eight
guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the kind of purple plan I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was a heavy smoking, like you
knew you smoked pot after a joint of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you let your lungs breathe for a
while and you just sit back and enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: that, uh, that Indica high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if he got that from, um,
Breed Bay, Sean Crump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to ask him because they were
selling that a strain called that at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, but it was some really weird,
like genetics that I had never heard of at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it was a Nepalese of some
sort, but I don't know if it's even the
[SPEAKER_00]: same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember grabbing it from eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I seem to remember from the
photos and I just saw photos last week
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was going through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it did have a Sean posted some photos
from way back in the day when he grew it
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor and it had a, it had a different
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not, you know, the leaf structure
was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The branching was a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen the Polly plants in pictures
and pictures always seem to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: leafier that same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wouldn't surprise me if it was some
sort of an apology in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Sean remembers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, eventually we've got to get them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so one, one interesting part,
I think it would be, uh, I know we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit about the beginning of
gorilla glue, but going more in depth to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, how it was hyped, why it was hyped,
how it became as famous as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it pre-planned?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it, uh, it was, it wasn't really pre
plans, but there were people who hit Josie
[SPEAKER_02]: up and were like, this is what,
you know, cookies had art was already in
[SPEAKER_02]: full on hype mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't even, I wasn't even aware of
Instagram at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean a lot, but just to,
to put it in perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there was a guy, Sunset limited,
maybe I believe what his name was,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, before we ran his ass out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, don't, don't ever come back here,
scumbag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, I think he helped Josie a lot with
advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, again, it was all right there
on thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still, I'm still catching up to that
point in my, in my reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, maybe we'll talk about that another
time and I'll have more details fresh,
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh in mind, but there was in some sense
of following of the cookie blueprint or
[SPEAKER_02]: for hyping a strain up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see why.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it didn't get hyped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's gotta be a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gotta be a reason to last out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to get hyped up first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I like gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I noticed with it,
I avoided growing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was like, really fuck wants this
poly hybrid mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like this isn't where I wanted
to take any breeding, but it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds just like it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, it's not all, all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually breeds like it looks and,
uh, passes on a lot of its best trades,
[SPEAKER_00]: which always surprised me with,
with all the crap crammed in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's been on a wild
ride, you know, and there's a lot of poly
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids with it in it that I enjoy more
than gorilla glue, which is the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: point of poly hybrids, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever get to try any of the,
uh, Gigi?
[SPEAKER_00]: One Gigi five, any of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, I got to smoke some of it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, not enough, not enough to make any
judgments versus number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, that's why when I was
getting invited to, to judge in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, certain events, I always said
no, because, you know, I don't really know
[SPEAKER_02]: a strain till I've smoked like I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured I got to smoke a half ounce over
a month before I can even make judgments
[SPEAKER_02]: on strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remember getting high off of the,
I believe it was, uh, I think it was the
[SPEAKER_02]: number five, the, you know, you had to
sign the contract or whatever that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember being high, but I just,
I don't have enough info to, pass on any
[SPEAKER_02]: wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isn't that, that is the hard part
about judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even, even when we do our meetups in the,
in the mountains and shit, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody dumps all this new shit that a
lot of us haven't tried like on the table
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're trying to smoke it all within
two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not fucking happening to
where you can really pin down anything
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, there's people who can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's people who can smoke in
one session four different kinds of flour
[SPEAKER_02]: and just pop off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And reel off their comments and,
and you can tell they're not faking,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, work like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of the guys I got to, you know,
I got to know, you gotta know it for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little while.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With me, strains hit me different at
different times of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in a different mood, like it hits
me all kinds of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk master Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cal, so Cal master.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you first see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always called it dirty, but it just
reminded me of Bubba Kush cross with
[SPEAKER_02]: master with a number of possible master
cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people still don't
realize master Kush was a general term,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for, for a seed strain or I
didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But individuals can always be found in
Kush populations that just stand out and
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody found that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think somebody hit Bubba with it
because they grow very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fucking Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a, uh, just a garbage reek,
you know, finisher on that sweet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like so Cal master.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see it pop back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, uh, I haven't seen it in a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some seeds on the burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's the, it's when I hit so Cal
master Kush, uh, with revs, I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either revs.
[SPEAKER_02]: F3 breeder mail or F4 pollen, which I've
selected myself from five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and even though it's not the ideal
combination in my mind, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: matter because what I'm looking for is,
is that master.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've still got Cindy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, uh, left with the so Cal master.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet it'll kick through that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it bred so dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know who was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Jim Jimmy Nitz might've done some
so Cal master Kush S ones at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not Zoolander Jimmy Nitz, uh,
Pisces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Zoolander did or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, is it, is that cut still around
so Cal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen it a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not from like a reliable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen cuts where that people call
master Kush that look just like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've never gotten my hands on it to be
sure, you know, but yeah, cross so Cal
[SPEAKER_02]: master Kush and hogs breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cal master OG and hogs breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the super hog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super hog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of me and me and Jimbo's
first, uh, process in San Diego with the
[SPEAKER_00]: hogs breath career.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a cut floating around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Cal, we gave it to G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we call it, uh, B H T's hogs breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, B H T had told dusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember dusty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a Danimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They trade and B H T went up there and
gave them what became known as B H T.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why, why was it called B H T's?
[SPEAKER_00]: What cut was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but was it the super hog?
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent the last of the seeds down to
bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if they popped or not,
but I did find some of the old little
[SPEAKER_00]: super hog in my collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any proof that I think you
sent me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have any proof that that was
what that cut was, but everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: unanimously said that tastes like hogs
breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it also had the look right from
start purple leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would get purple and if the leaves were
layered, the unders is the, the top of the
leaf that was under would not turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ended up with all these cross
patterns on all your imprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was another dang strain that I
wish hadn't disappeared because that was
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when we made those,
we made something like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was going out of unified.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was selling them for like, I don't
know, it was like five bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed or some silly or five bucks a
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should have been flying around
everywhere, but who knows where,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they all ended up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another one of those strands.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was that many seeds out there,
I'm amazed there are more cuts.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are those two in its name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with, with the way the name game goes
though, you know, it could be out there
[SPEAKER_00]: under some other stupid fucking name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The super hog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creative in the end in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strain names are not so easy anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hate naming shit now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like when a cultural other cultural
phenomenon work their way into the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis seed name game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, I remember when or cut,
you know, um, I remember when game of
[SPEAKER_02]: thrones was big, everything was police to
this police to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, other shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you know, you're running out
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or when you, you have a string called
blue cocky because you're just gross like
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't have this one in the list,
but I remember talking to you and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, um, you had Kim D pretty early on in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you remember the sourcing on all
that and where it showed up and when?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I got that from, uh, from crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something we talked about openly
online, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't find, you know, same where I
got it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does neither.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he got from, from Greg, which I
understand sometimes does bring questions
[SPEAKER_02]: into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this case from.
[SPEAKER_02]: From everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got the right cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I love both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, when I, I started growing
those two cuts at the same time and there
[SPEAKER_02]: was two years there where that's what I
smoked, you know, two bond rips of East
[SPEAKER_02]: coast sour diesel followed by one of Kim
D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I had it down pat and that's when
I really started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice what I've always said about Kim D
because it's definitely in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the goat debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that I still to this day have not
built a tolerance to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's weed that I love that if I smoke
so long, I just don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just quit satisfying, you know,
whatever, whatever physiology I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but Kim B to this day is one of the
most potent, uh, cuts for me out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that no ceiling high that people
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's the epitome of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched, I've watched it white people
out that smoke heavy, heavy, heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to go sour diesel, which I
guess is related to Kim D according to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim 91 by, by Kim 91.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, East coast sour diesel, that original
East coast sour diesel from the Kim
[SPEAKER_02]: family, uh, was the perfect example of,
I could smoke a lot of East coast sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did it, uh, because I enjoyed the
taste, but at any point in the smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: session, I follow up sour diesel with Kim
D.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, okay, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still the best sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right there with sourdough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two best sour plants in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of other good ones, but I'm just
saying those two were both, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: peak performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were spoiled, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the, we, I think we had the best
sours down in San Diego personally via
[SPEAKER_00]: that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all I needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had started up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you incorporate with at some
point you have to draw the line and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, enough of this kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me grow some of these others I want to
get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've got those two, you've got
both of the types of sour than there are
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got, you got both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the peak of both like OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many different OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: OGs that I still remember, you know,
to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour is the same way, but to me,
there's two basic profiles with OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got three or four basic profiles and
then variations on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just smoked 92 OG for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blasted high right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I've taken three hits off of
that bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, uh, the New Mexico process of
drying and carrying continues to fascinate
[SPEAKER_02]: me and elude me really Max.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put my buddy here on the fish stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some of that 92, 92 OG from,
I wasn't even sure it was OG when I opened
[SPEAKER_02]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by day three of being in the jar,
I was like, okay, yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a dirty OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's a cat or game.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a collective that 92,
uh, came from specifically that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that they started calling 92.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's dirty OGs like Valley OG was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not sweet Valley OG was, but it's,
it's that dirt OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were one of the few, uh, other dudes
that grew residence cut of OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rascals cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same same, same, same as far as I
could tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I grew up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the legit original rascal cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's all on the thread because
rascal was best.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know we weren't supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I remember all that shit and I
remember how it came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when, uh, this dude Doug had
it, he had it before rascal was really
[SPEAKER_00]: blasting it out big and there was a whole
bunch of drama on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess there was a business deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a business venture that was going to be
formed between rascal wick six 50.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another dude who's still around,
you know, wick anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another dude who's still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't say his name, but they were
going to do a business venture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it fell apart and wick and the
other dude got, got pissed and wick gave
[SPEAKER_02]: his cut out to a few people among them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: After some back and forth with rascal,
we just said, look, man, we won't,
[SPEAKER_02]: we won't, I won't make seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't sell seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's like, all right,
you guys got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was cool about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that was a great cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a, that was a hydro OG cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of them are growing hydro
and they are head and shoulders above
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else, everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydro cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two years later, when I ran resin cut,
residence cut me and the guy I was growing
[SPEAKER_02]: with time, we both, as soon as we could
smell it, you know, we're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that's, that's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time I ever ran was, was Maui
skunk dog and residence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me tell you, that was the
stinkiest table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The residence cut is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely meant to be run hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually gave us the recipe that they
used to use it when they do like the Cholo
[SPEAKER_00]: mansions, blowing up hydro tables and
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like some, I want to say Jacks
or something like that, or some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some hard, hard nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just used RO water and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I, that's my fallback too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have, well, hydro is still
hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still got a controller, but I don't,
I don't measure PPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't measure pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at this point, not this far in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day record.
[SPEAKER_02]: Day record, day record diesel,
which was never really that decently to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, to me it was more like a chem 91 OG
hybrid somewhere right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite as sweet as OG, but Grotech and
I did a project where he reversed the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: 91 and hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave them chem 91, can be and rascals
cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, yeah, we made seeds, but we did not
sell any seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this wasn't, this wasn't thousands of
thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, matter of fact, those seeds got
stolen after he had in the day record
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can be rascal and original diesel got
hit with chem 91 reverse pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that chem 91 was definitely legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That came from money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about that openly on the
thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think don't mind that being
known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that we call that super record.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, the original D the day record
cross with chem 91, we called super
[SPEAKER_02]: record.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I've got some pics of that up
on my Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some of the gooiest, just most
frost covered flower ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have some seats, but I'm zero for
the last sick waiting for the next step in
[SPEAKER_02]: seed cracking science technology,
because there's some, uh, a friend of mine
[SPEAKER_02]: had an eight, uh, in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was taking it home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was a quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a quarter, a quarter ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had to go through the checkpoint
and they, they went through every surface
[SPEAKER_02]: of his vehicle after he showed them
there's the quarter ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, there's no way that's all
the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they tore into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't tear into it, but they,
they searched every place you could put
[SPEAKER_02]: weed without tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kept on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not dumb enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than this through a, through a border
checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it like the Arizona checkpoint?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was just one of the many in North
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Southern and they're not border
checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all know the ag checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The agricultural checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're drug interdiction
checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why are you doing immigration 80
miles North border?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's too late.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would have liked to have
tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm a big fan of day wrecker as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with chem 91 on that, that would be
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be super fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 91 makes killer crosses a lot of the
offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find chem 91 to be pretty boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not the high, the high is chem on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but I think it's rather boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of ugly too on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too pretty, not too, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in hybrid, awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensi star.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your first experience with Sensi
star?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, that's one of the few
strains I've tried from, uh, from a
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the earliest ones in
dispensaries that I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when dispensary started popping up,
Sensi star was one of the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud being sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool to, uh, you know, we had all
seen the Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't even think Rosenthal's books
were out yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we'd all seen the Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really cool to go to dispensary
and buy some pop that I had never thrown
[SPEAKER_02]: or smoked and just match it up with,
with what we saw or the beginnings of the
[SPEAKER_02]: online.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember enjoying Sensi star.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it being a solid high,
you know, having that really light sugary
[SPEAKER_02]: sweetness, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the sweet cannabis tones in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what turf profiles those are
or any of that shit, but you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it matched up pretty good with
the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually, by the time it got
released, uh, it made it over here in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Luke had released it in Femseed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty uniform too, even from the,
even from the seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the kind of Sensi star they had on
the East coast would match up a lot with
[SPEAKER_00]: what was going on in the West coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you can wax poetic about the SRAM.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the SRAM and I really did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got excited when a friend of
mine got that cut back recently and I
[SPEAKER_02]: started thinking about potential seed
making projects immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got excited and, uh, that excitement
tempered a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as far as the seed making goes,
when I think Colombian, I believe that's
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian Romulan.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of experience I have with
different Colombian genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that there's nothing
scientific about that conclusion,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in my decision making process,
that's the conclusion I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but as far as smoking, I really liked
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that's the, and I know it's,
it's an old stereotype of that strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that is the most nag chopper incense
light strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it smells while it's growing,
that's what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like that when you're smoking it
and it smells like that in the room after
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does the person still have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you were talking to?
[SPEAKER_00]: They still rocking it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they've flowered it yet,
but supposedly they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: My DMs to remind myself of which person
that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate when that fucking happens,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm sure they'll give it a good
running test and I don't think it's on the
[SPEAKER_02]: lockdown or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt it because so few people know what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you even know to want it anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually I remember true me picking
people when he released that guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it got passed around number of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time I grew it, I actually killed it
off of like day 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, look, I'm just to start again
because I did not plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never grown a plant stretch like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was in a closet at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even have a tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just, she took off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, beyond even tying over the space
between, I'm like, okay, I know what I did
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I flowered her at like two feet
tall in the closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven feet tall in three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, I grew her for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the bud structure always annoyed me a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not a, it was not a yield or weight
wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I finally got her put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since I have acquired, uh,
a taste for, for dry sift hash and making
[SPEAKER_02]: my own hash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real quick, like kind of as an aside,
when you talk about dry sift hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you, would you prefer the profile of
the resin to be more greasy or more like
[SPEAKER_00]: sandy for doing dry sift hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: That a hundred percent, not because of the
quality of hash, just for the sake of
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping your screens fucking clean,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Difference when you're, when you're dry
sifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've got some strains that,
uh, that I've sifted a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, man, I just, I don't want to
dry sift this shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually, it's actually, uh,
chopped cherries by Rolandis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't expect the resins to
be that gooey because of the way they grow
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they even look on the flowers and
the leaf material, uh, but they aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: gooey when they go through that screen,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but the hashes from that stuff is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a big hit because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love that chopped cherry hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just, I was reading, uh,
Fletcher argue with somebody about how
[SPEAKER_02]: chopped can of cherries was just a lower
remake of the Tanj hit with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember what the argument
was about, but I thought he was short
[SPEAKER_02]: shifting chopped can of cherries a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've always wondered how you get
cherry on top of orange because orange is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually so dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a hard pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the cut that, that I have now,
uh, I haven't grown it yet, but I've seen
[SPEAKER_02]: it being grown for the half years by my
buddy here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been making the hash with that
leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's more orange than, than it is
cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the hash, once you sift it,
like it's almost like, it's almost like
[SPEAKER_02]: the orange chirps don't make final screen
for the hash, but cherry do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes out very much smelling like
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it a cherry pie cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: The chopped cherries?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, it doesn't seem like,
uh, it doesn't seem like cherry pie to me
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually liked cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran that for a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a little closer to didn't,
uh, didn't CSI do a cherry pie can be
[SPEAKER_02]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a nice combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked, I've always liked cherry pie
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess trop, trop cherries is,
uh, I just looked at Relentless's site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Tropicana cookies, which was,
uh, I don't know, tangy cookies crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: with cherry cookies F3, which I don't know
much about their, their cherry cookies or
[SPEAKER_00]: what made the cherry or whatever,
but it's a gorgeous cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gorgeous cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Relentless a lot too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been rooting for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of the guys that came up on the
forums, you know, or even were already in
[SPEAKER_02]: their early years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to have a different attitude
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know why I've always gotten
along with him real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, uh, it's one of those things
where, you know, just kind of get where
[SPEAKER_00]: each other came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of bullshit, what kind of
bullshit each other put up with to get
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and fish stick, uncle fish stick
from the forums, he's, he's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he also has a cherry cookies cut that
is actually, that is a pretty insane cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was when, when he started
growing that, I got some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first time I've been here in
Las Cruces and found something that I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, oops, I smoked a little too much at
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of surprised, you know, it took me
off guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a number of cookies crosses that
I like smoking, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but now he's also got a cut of what's the
Kim D isn't, uh, what's the Kim D GMO is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a, yeah, it's a Kim D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's a forum or Kim D or
some kind of cookie Kim D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, speaking of New Mexico,
drying and curing, you know, that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got sample of, and it's about three
weeks of curing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, I mean, it just, yeah,
dude, you can tell there's Kim D in it
[SPEAKER_00]: just when you smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell there's Kim D in it just when
you smell it, like instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, it's still, I kind of milked that,
that jar a little bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, the 92 OG potency wise,
it punches the GMO in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a, it's one of those,
it's one of those little D cuts that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not sure I would want that to be my
permanent OG cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a heavy hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I smoked the last GMO now instead of
92 OG before the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm still, I'm like ready to fall
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, speaking of OG, did you ever get to
try the Tokyo OG when you were in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Diego?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I remember that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Point Loma.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people talking about the Tokyo
OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first there was the usual, you know,
bitching and moaning to rename this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happened with every single OG
that popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I smoked it, I couldn't
drive home, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't drive home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to give someone my keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I was like, fuck,
this is strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I figured any other fucking
OG, but it was strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something else to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The variety that has come from the,
what I assume are all S1 seeds or not all
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean just the quality I've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So resin lung, in addition to that cut,
he gave me two big vials of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be, I don't know, a thousand OG
seeds that were just taken out.
[SPEAKER_02]: His crew was moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's even got two guys' name on the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From I think, oh, I think it's dated 04
through 08.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a bunch of bag seeds from the big,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they didn't want the seeds going
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were picking them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm over probably 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: On those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, I always just
occasionally get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll come back to bite me though,
because, you know, I like to pop five at a
[SPEAKER_02]: time in my current setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll drop those in now like 30 or 40
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day you're going to get 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get like 85% germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: How could you let any of that shit go?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely couldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a bunch of old seeds that I want
to pop right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is having room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having room and viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I told you the story about
Grace Cole sent me the last of the bull
[SPEAKER_00]: rider seeds that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were from Jerbo, one of the
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a person that I thought was
going to be able to crack them by tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that dude ended up being not able to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I sent him back to Grace Cole and I
don't know if he ever found anyone for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those would be worth it to try to
crack, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, some of those, I don't know if it
was the same time or maybe it was once you
[SPEAKER_02]: sent back to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had zero luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even tried the seed cracker on a couple
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried putting some straight dirt and
made sure that, you know, they didn't get,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like three times a day,
just making sure it wasn't packed too hard
[SPEAKER_02]: above the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always wondered if old Betsy
was self, if you could go through that
[SPEAKER_00]: population and find something more similar
to bull rider than old Betsy itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're truly related.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to check out those pictures
Sean has a new bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't seen him.
[SPEAKER_02]: The look to it is very similar to bull
rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell just by looking at the buds
between bull rider and Afghani bull rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pick each one of them out immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I've seen of the live plants
that Sean posted, it's definitely a bull
[SPEAKER_02]: rider leaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if he's smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he's finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit them up and find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we covered some of this about,
um, where the cut came from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the different nomenclature of it,
whether it was the 98 cup winning cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, whether it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about what
you've seen in the breeding that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I went back because a number of
people hit me up about it after class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went back and looked on my Instagram
and my, where, where I was posting about
[SPEAKER_02]: it as I was growing it, as I was curing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, there's more info in those
five or six posts than, than what I even
[SPEAKER_02]: went over on the show last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes up, you look at the six
of my last seven flower posts have been,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, three different types of plant that
I've seen that a number of people have
[SPEAKER_02]: seen, you know, come from those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one thing that came up,
I noticed a lot was lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot how limey those things were,
especially one in particular last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, on my Instagram, I described it as
limey as, or limey Jack correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really reminded me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herrera is actually one of,
uh, I think when we were talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: sensei star, I mentioned getting a strain
from it, Spencer and trusting that that
[SPEAKER_02]: was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herrera was one of the first ones I
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as I enjoy that first,
uh, Jack experience that I had Spencer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the primary difference between the
classic Jack Herrera and the SSH to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, was the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little more, uh, with the SSH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that comes across, uh,
in that last run, I did a three different
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: One I described as limey, one was limey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one was the beardo, which was
just pissed off and looked unhappy the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you could tell, you could tell that
the, it's one of the two hazes in SSH in
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I described it last time as 90s seat
catalog stock photo of a 90s haze hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was very typical pictures from back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that was actually the 2000s
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was the 90s too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but she's very dominant in the one
cross I've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you like SSH, you'll like
everything that comes from this plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, from this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's the one we have labeled,
uh, SSSDH on the, uh, on site on riot
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, uh, it's definitely, the non haze
leaners, the haze leaners are obvious from
[SPEAKER_02]: what I've been told from the other growers
who have grown it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've seen pictures of what I've grown
here myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, number one, they don't like small
containers for their roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a bigger container.
[SPEAKER_02]: The SSH is the SSH leaners are very much,
uh, classic indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow this much from this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost hydro properties when it comes to
the plane you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew them in three gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big yielders as you would expect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's pure SSH right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the haze leaners, which I really
got a kick out of, uh, they want the
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger, the bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comes through in the high, uh,
much more body than the SSH leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have the same look.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the SSH mom, you don't
think pure sativa by any stretch of the
[SPEAKER_02]: imagination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because just too good of a,
the buds are thick and branches are fully
[SPEAKER_02]: loaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but from the taste and the smell,
you definitely get the sativa impression.
Yeah.
Uh, but don't you, it'll, it'll kick you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll kick you in the stomach,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like an ideal, the ideal hybrid
using a super silver haze and the
[SPEAKER_00]: sourdough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you'd get lucky in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said on the first show,
pretty much the only thing I said on the
[SPEAKER_02]: first show was it wasn't what I was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just because it doesn't
resemble anything to do with sourdouble
[SPEAKER_02]: except a sweetness, uh, a heightness in
heightening and improving the sweetness of
[SPEAKER_02]: SSH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause yes, that cedar overbite,
you know, a little bit accurate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the sourdouble makes it a little
sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives it a better height or at
least a more balanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loved that SSH high,
you know, that height right between Indica
[SPEAKER_02]: and sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it just wasn't potent enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think I used the idea of how
many, how much we had to smoke to get
[SPEAKER_02]: through a Raiders game.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to smoke a lot, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the only downside, but it tastes so
good that, you know, like sourdouble or
[SPEAKER_02]: East coast sourdiesel, you just keep
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could imagine that lip smacking
translate, like how with the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: translating on, on top of that,
uh, SSH would be really fricking nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not to say that won't pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a 50 seat grow going with KRD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where he's got long beach,
wherever out there in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe he will find more of that sour
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely something if,
if I were to describe it, I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get the SSH experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of the younger generation
are not as hip to the SSH and I'm sure a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot are interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great place for them to start,
you know, as opposed to trying to hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: through, you know, 30 seeds of fucking
super silver haze to try to find one
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and if you knew, you know,
if you're new to smoking, if you came
[SPEAKER_02]: around after the SSHs and the Neville's
haze, this is a good plant because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: got all the potency that any of the
newfangled stuff has.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's an ass kicker for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you're not going to a pure SSH
experience at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna, you're still going to get
all the body that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is the flowering time on average?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think, uh, people get a chance to
find there?
[SPEAKER_02]: All the SSH leaners I've flowered,
I've flowered for 68, 70 days.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the haze leaners, uh, I took mine to,
uh, 85 this last time and it probably
[SPEAKER_02]: could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was, it was Segeva, you know,
it was hate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it had one of the interesting things
about that plant that I'd forgotten about
[SPEAKER_02]: was when I had it, I had it in tub,
you know, finishing up dry and burping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I would open it, the aroma was
movie theater popcorn butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not expect it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but when you, an individual flower and
held it to your nose, give it a little
[SPEAKER_02]: squeeze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was like sweet tarts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the weirdest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a dichotomy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your situations and post-cure it lost the,
the movie theater butter popcorn smell,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just sweetness, but didn't taste like
SSH at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't look like SSH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a very dense, small,
um, haze, you know, a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: haze hybrids out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of range.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the smaller flowers that were
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: He yielded huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked that cut and I cut alone for
almost six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really went full on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my first real experience with the
Steve, uh, even though it's not pure
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Netic by, by breeding by lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, it was hateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my first real experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember talking to you during it and
how your, how your, uh, opinion changed
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I kind of liked this
fucking shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a complete one 80, uh, over the
course of a year, you know, some,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, some work hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and again, cure is nothing new to any
of us, but it's still something that can
[SPEAKER_02]: amaze me to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, I still got some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dry as hell, but I still have some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when, when people talk about
making live resin hash and like doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: without curing the plant, how does that,
how does that hit you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, does that sound advisable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hashing for terpies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when they advertise it,
that's, I mean, the highs, no way is the
[SPEAKER_02]: high going to be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have the term correct, any live
resin, live rosin, any live resin hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just means they cut the plant down,
trimmed it and threw it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, I'm not dogging it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking rosin changed a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I ever smoked, um,
but yeah, no, it's not going to have the
[SPEAKER_02]: same properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many chemical processes that we
still have, that scientists still have not
[SPEAKER_02]: looked into within.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, not to mention what happens when you
completely compress and mix those,
[SPEAKER_02]: those chemicals and then let them form
into, into a third chemical compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't personally, there is no
concentrate that I don't like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but to me, the solventless,
uh, cured hashish is just my personal
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I remember the first time keeping
track of curing the flowers that I
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested and doing it and burping it in
the beginning, having them in glass jars
[SPEAKER_02]: the first few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it, it, it really blows your mind
the first time you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some are more dependent on it than
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rebs, Cindy 99 is probably the most sure
dependent strain I've ever seen because
[SPEAKER_02]: what goes into those jars after harvest is
so heavy smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost makes me nauseous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or six weeks later is that sweet white
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you expect from Cindy 99.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, so I'm a big fan of curing
before making hashish concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you're talking about cannabis
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still going to get you higher.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just, I was thinking about that
because people were asking me about doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, concentrates with my blueberry and
realistically blueberry, the type that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've made and worked on, it takes a good
month for it to fully form back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause once you chop it down, a lot of
that, that super berry smell dissipates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you cure it, it comes back full
force, like tenfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people were talking about making live
rosin with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, I don't, I don't know how
that's going to do any faith, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: favors for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're chasing blueberry, you know,
well, again, that's what we say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would say that there's plants
that smell that the way they smell at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of harvest, preferable in some,
you know, fine points here and there to
[SPEAKER_02]: the cured smell, you know, there's
something out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say they're, they're pressing for
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I assume because I've
never heard the argument that fresh resin
[SPEAKER_02]: is more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming that when they do the
live, they're doing a particular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember strawberry cream was that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was another one where it
was like instantly the way it smelled at
[SPEAKER_00]: cure or right at dry was super strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really didn't get much more strawberry
as it cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably would be good for something
like that in that sense, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how the high would translate for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, and when you're pressing,
meaning what I assume to be heat,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, rosy, you're getting all the
turps that are on that planet at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when you do dry sift, for example,
or bubble hash, my two favorite ways of
[SPEAKER_02]: hashing, uh, you've got different size
screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a lot of cases, like bubble people
are bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep a lot of different grades.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep anywhere from two to five grades
for different reasons.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, reasons are they're all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can go within the sizes that
made it through each screen and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: assume, uh, especially as you,
as you get smaller, that everything going
[SPEAKER_02]: through that screen is one kind of
trichome or trichome stock or some plants
[SPEAKER_02]: have different size trichomes,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when, when I do dry sift, the,
the trough cherries is a good example.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that as flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to, you're going to be hit
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's citrus orange smell right off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for whatever reason, I only keep hash
that's been worked on 220 lines per inch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever's left top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the 220 LPI, which is 75 microns,
whatever's left on top of that 220 LPI
[SPEAKER_02]: screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my hash is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even keep any of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean they're not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean they're not potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, that's, that's the hash each.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so when I screen the tropical
cherries, wherever those, whatever those
[SPEAKER_02]: orange cherries are at, wherever they're
kept at, it doesn't make my 220 screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either the, the, the pile below it or
the pile that was left on top of the 110
[SPEAKER_02]: that I used to get 220.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can carry pipe tobacco smell and no
citrus at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even realized or came to the
conclusion that it could do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that makes total sense as you
explained it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of stream of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, because I'm still learning how
it's going, but that's, that's a really
[SPEAKER_02]: good example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, the blueberry nine,
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely blueberry either at time of
harvest or a month down the road or
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean that blueberry terpene
will make it into the hatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it opens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought about it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the second oldest form of cannabis
behind growing the plant itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, is still the most unexplained and
that's, you know, dry sift hash each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still unexplained form, unexplored
scientifically form of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where about an hour and 20 in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, uh, let's see, is there
anything else you wanted to get in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're going to do some more,
uh, San Diego's cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that we ever talked about J
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit up J one with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we haven't touched on J one yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get you back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a phone call coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a phone call coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so we didn't, we didn't touch on
that last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a wicked strain, uh, for,
for bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the best I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, to our knowledge, it's a Jack Herrera
stump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, uh, was brought back from
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: What my source thinks is the, the 90%
solid story of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the forums were getting gone and me
and this guy had already been in touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a friend of, he was a friend of
breads.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's passed on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain or noi from, uh, the cabana or
skunk magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, old timer buddies with rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one and got me all of revs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems, uh, calling from his breeders
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the intermediary between me and the
rep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he had this cut the forums were
getting going and he had an interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted to bring J one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was up in Shasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he brought it down to see Diego and he
wanted to see online how fast he would
[SPEAKER_02]: take that spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because the internet was new to us
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we already had the cuts thread going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already had the seeds thread going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just see what.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we gave it to G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think he was working with Shannon
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he gave it out and we gave him
lots of cuts that he grew into a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it spread fast and you literally could
watch it in the forums as it made its way
[SPEAKER_02]: back up North.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within the first two months,
there are already two bullshit origin
[SPEAKER_02]: stories out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was, it grew so Jack career life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but even more coded with resin than
best pictures, Jack or they ever showed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was just coded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it smelled like a yellow Gatorade to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Expresses yellow Gatorade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the potency factor wasn't really
keeping up with everything else that was
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a nice, it was a nice daytime
smoke, but it, uh, it went through the
[SPEAKER_02]: circles down there and seeing it go pretty
quick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember there was a collective in,
um, San Diego called BCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was downtown Broadway in between
seventh and eighth on Broadway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would sell the, the, whatever the
worst bud that they had at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would label J one and they would sell
it as J one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fucked up is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a bad rap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a bunch of yuppies anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figures, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a nice combo of those nineties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed it to, uh, matter of fact,
same guy got me some iron Cindy falling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I hit that and made F one J one
cross with iron Cindy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of those seats made their
way to a user.
[SPEAKER_02]: His username was you are average with a U
and an R, uh, average.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made both F twos and F threes and
made sure I got some of those seats back
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be interesting because you throw that
metal haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some of the metal haze and some of
the metal haze hybrids rev and mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: are part of a group of growers in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each fall I would get a box from
mountain and it was like iron Cindy,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, cherry Malawi, BR 1948 combinations
there and, uh, outdoor ground by old
heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, I mean, like if you were put hot in
a, in a capsule to send to aliens,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are the guys you'd want growing it
in that area of the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just some of the best outdoor weed
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that haze puts, puts a little oomph in
anything that it was crossed with the iron
[SPEAKER_02]: Cindy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got, I got his, uh, metal haze cut
early on, like the actual cut cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was able to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was definitely cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, made a lot of crosses with it early on
rev rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, uh, a relic from the past and not
enough of the younger dudes know about
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's very influential.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, on Instagram, cause they got some,
uh, red, is it Russian river skunk or red,
[SPEAKER_01]: red, red, red Russian skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Russian skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked up a pack of those and I was
like, I don't understand why this guy has
[SPEAKER_02]: never had his time in, in the,
you know, online world, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's all over the world who know who he
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's always bitching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want something that's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using the same shit will hit up kingdom
organic seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's all different there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because he never dipped into
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never dipped into any hype strains and
crossed him into his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was like no little middle ground
for like people that wanted OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: but wanted to try something different with
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they just never got introduced to him
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to be from a certain era to really
get what he was doing and why he was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it the way he was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, he has killer shit at seventies
and eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used madness across.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But madness was not like the others
madness was, you know, an Oregon big butt
[SPEAKER_02]: cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from the era before P 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that, uh, which is probably why he
liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: He deserves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess, I guess we can call this
one an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you want to get in
on this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're going to probably do a few
more anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I made notes, but they're all in
my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time we'll teach you how to hook
up your phone to your printer to print
[SPEAKER_00]: them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, go check out, go check out Rob seeds,
uh, right seeds.com has, um, we still have
[SPEAKER_00]: some more of this gang dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to put bunch back in stock that
people didn't pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the, uh, SSSDH, which was the S
the super silver hay, sour dub that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anyone you want to shout out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to wear this tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my buddies, my buddy Saba,
but yeah, we've snapped back and they just
don't make snap backs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get fucking heads like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the local artist here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does some fucking bad-ass t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I love he does t-shirt Southwest,
like North base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some bullshit.

Instagram.

[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's my first shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your first shout out, huh?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate you taking the time to
talk with me and this is going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: one of many, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably won't remember much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking OG killed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go actually got a lot more in than I
thought we would.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know what we did forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next time is we can, I'd like to get
into that daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was all logged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally I'm going through the threads
and I see, okay, here I made a post right
[SPEAKER_02]: here and the post is so what's this I hear
about double half the plan is shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other half is perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ridiculous and stupid at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'm still, as far as I got,
we're like just starting to work our way
[SPEAKER_02]: through the, through the confusion and TMV
came back up right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which was a lot more credible when
plants started dudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I assume what we were all calling
dudding, it was the HPLV or HLV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked with Tumi organics and if I
remember correctly, they did say that
[SPEAKER_00]: patient zero was soured up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's the, that's what is that if
you have HPLVD, eventually your plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to start dudding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was, uh, it took over the San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we'd go into this next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just a little taste of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people know what to expect next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that wiped a lot of people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucked a lot of us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we get for trading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it would, if it worked its way
through as fast as I remember it,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I find it hard to believe we're ever
going to be rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it's, it's totaled a lot of the
libraries in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it got transported over there via
cookies and all kinds of other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's still working its way around
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just taking shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate you and we'll have you
